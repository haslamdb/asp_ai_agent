# CICU Prolonged Antibiotics Module - ASP Educational Framework

## Module Overview

**Module ID:** `cicu_prolonged_antibiotics`  
**Target Learners:** Antimicrobial Stewardship Fellows (PGY 4-6)  
**Estimated Completion Time:** 4-6 hours across multiple sessions  
**Competency Domains:** Leadership, Data Analytics, Behavioral Science, Clinical Interventions

## Clinical Problem Statement

The Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) frequently administers meropenem and vancomycin for prolonged periods (>7 days) in pediatric patients with fever, even when all cultures remain negative after 48-72 hours. This practice pattern represents:

- **large fraction** of CICU patients receiving empiric broad-spectrum coverage
- **prolonged** average duration (vs. 3-5 days recommended)
- **almost all patients** with negative cultures at 48 hours
- **$$$** estimated annual excess medication costs
- Increased risk of antimicrobial resistance, C. difficile, and adverse drug events

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this module, fellows will be able to:

1. **Analyze** antibiotic utilization data to identify inappropriate prolonged use patterns
2. **Design** evidence-based interventions to reduce unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotics
3. **Implement** behavioral change strategies to modify prescriber habits
4. **Create** metrics to track success and identify areas needing countermeasures
5. **Lead** multi-disciplinary teams in sustainable practice change

## Module Structure

### Progressive Difficulty Levels

The module adapts to learner performance, progressing through four levels:

#### Level 1: BEGINNER - Data Analysis & Problem Identification

**Scenario Context:**  
You've been asked to review CICU antibiotic use data showing concerning patterns.

**Key Tasks:**
- Calculate days of therapy (DOT) per 1000 patient days
- Compare to national benchmarks (NHSN pediatric ICU data)
- Identify gaps between guidelines and current practice
- Create compelling data visualizations
- Draft problem statement for leadership presentation

**Assessment Focus:**
- Accuracy of DOT calculations
- Appropriate use of benchmarks
- Quality of data presentation
- Problem framing effectiveness

**Success Criteria:**
- Correctly calculates DOT/1000 patient days (850 current vs. 600 target)
- Identifies 250 excess DOT per 1000 patient days
- Creates clear visualization showing trend over time
- Frames as both patient safety AND quality issue

---

#### Level 2: INTERMEDIATE - Intervention Design & Stakeholder Engagement

**Scenario Context:**  
CICU leadership acknowledges the problem but cites multiple barriers:
- "These critically ill cardiac patients - we can't take risks"
- "Our patients differ from general PICU"
- "Weekly attending rotation disrupts consistency"
- "Fellows fear challenging antibiotic decisions"

**Key Tasks:**
- Develop cardiac-specific antibiotic guidelines with clear stop points
- Create 48-hour timeout protocol with explicit criteria
- Design communication framework for antibiotic discussions
- Build champion network (nurses, pharmacists, physicians)
- Address hierarchy issues through psychological safety measures

**Assessment Focus:**
- Evidence base for interventions
- Stakeholder engagement approach
- Behavioral science application
- Protocol feasibility

**Success Criteria:**
- Uses COM-B model or similar framework
- Addresses cognitive biases (commission bias, loss aversion)
- Includes multi-disciplinary team members
- Creates clear decision algorithms
- Incorporates nudges and choice architecture

---

#### Level 3: ADVANCED - Implementation & Real-Time Problem Solving

**Scenario Context:**  
Two months post-implementation shows mixed results:
- 30% reduction in meropenem+vancomycin starts ✓
- Duration only decreased from 8.5 to 7.2 days ✗
- 3 attendings consistently bypass protocol
- 1 late-onset sepsis case creating fear
- Nurses report confusion about decision authority

**Key Tasks:**
- Perform root cause analysis on late sepsis case
- Develop targeted interventions for resistant attendings
- Clarify decision-making roles (RACI matrix)
- Create positive reinforcement for early adopters
- Implement real-time audit and feedback
- Address fear with data and education

**Assessment Focus:**
- Problem-solving approach
- Adaptability to challenges
- Leadership under pressure
- Data-driven decision making

**Success Criteria:**
- Systematic approach to adverse event analysis
- Personalized engagement strategies
- Clear role delineation
- Balance of accountability and support
- Evidence-based reassurance

---

#### Level 4: EXPERT - Sustainability & System-Level Change

**Scenario Context:**  
Six months shows significant success:
- 45% reduction in inappropriate use
- $380,000 cost savings
- No increase in sepsis/mortality
- Improved nurse satisfaction

New challenges emerge:
- NICU wants adaptation for their population
- New fellows need onboarding
- Administration wants quality metrics
- Step-down units have similar issues
- Insurance denying prolonged courses

**Key Tasks:**
- Create unit-specific adaptation framework
- Design onboarding program for rotating staff
- Develop quality metrics and accountability structures
- Build automated clinical decision support
- Establish stewardship rounds across ICUs
- Navigate insurance/financial implications
- Publish and disseminate findings

**Assessment Focus:**

- Scale and spread methodology
- Scholarly dissemination

**Success Criteria:**
- Flexible toolkit vs. rigid protocols
- Automated systems for sustainability
- Risk-adjusted quality metrics
- Business case with ROI
- Multi-center collaboration plan
- Peer-reviewed publication outline
