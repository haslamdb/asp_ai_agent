Subject: Expert Review Needed - ASP AI Agent Feedback (10 min)

Dear Dr. [Name],

I'm developing an AI-powered teaching tool for antimicrobial stewardship fellowship training. Before we launch, I need expert validation of the AI-generated feedback to ensure it's clinically accurate and pedagogically sound.

Would you be willing to spend 10-15 minutes reviewing 1-2 AI feedback samples?

Review Form: [INSERT YOUR GOOGLE FORM LINK HERE]

What you'll do:
- Review a fellow's response and the AI feedback they received
- Rate the AI feedback quality (2 quick ratings)
- Provide what YOU would say instead
- Note what the AI missed

Your expertise would really strengthen this tool, and you'll be acknowledged in all related publications.

Thank you for considering!

Best regards,
[Your Name]

P.S. Your responses are anonymous and will only be used to improve the AI system.
