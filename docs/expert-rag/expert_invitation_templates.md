EXPERT FEEDBACK REQUEST
ASP Fellowship AI Curriculum Development

BACKGROUND & PURPOSE

A recent national survey of pediatric infectious diseases fellowship directors
(41.5% response rate) found that while 63% of programs have a formal antimicrobial
stewardship (AS) curriculum, significant gaps exist in advanced competencies.
Program directors expressed low satisfaction with fellows' readiness for leadership
roles and identified key training deficits in:

• Leadership skills
• Data analytics
• Understanding psychosocial factors of prescribing

All respondents agreed on the need for a standardized curriculum. These findings
support the development of a national, advanced pediatric AS curriculum to
complement existing foundational training.

WHY WE'RE DEVELOPING AN AI-POWERED CURRICULUM

To address these identified gaps, we are developing an AI-powered adaptive learning
platform that provides fellows with individualized feedback on complex ASP scenarios.
The AI generates real-time feedback on fellows' responses across four key competency
domains: data analysis, behavioral intervention, implementation science, and clinical
decision making.

YOUR ROLE AS AN EXPERT REVIEWER

You have been selected for this review because of your recognized expertise in
antimicrobial stewardship. Your input is critical to ensure the AI feedback is
both clinically accurate and pedagogically effective.

This form collects your expert corrections of AI-generated feedback. Your insights
will directly improve the quality of feedback provided to fellows nationwide.

PUBLICATION & CO-AUTHORSHIP

We intend to publish a manuscript describing this curriculum development process
and its validation. All experts who provide substantive input (defined as reviewing
3 or more AI feedback samples) will be offered co-authorship on the manuscript.

ESTIMATED TIME: 10-15 minutes per review

Thank you for contributing your expertise to advance ASP fellowship training!

Subject: Co-Authorship Opportunity - Expert Review for National ASP Curriculum

Dear Dr. [Name],

I'm writing to invite you to contribute to an important initiative addressing
identified gaps in pediatric antimicrobial stewardship fellowship training.

BACKGROUND: NATIONAL SURVEY FINDINGS

We recently completed a national survey of pediatric infectious diseases fellowship
directors (41.5% response rate) that revealed significant training gaps. Key findings:

• While 63% of programs have a formal AS curriculum, advanced competencies are lacking
• Program directors expressed LOW satisfaction with fellows' readiness for leadership
• Key deficits identified:
  - Leadership skills
  - Data analytics
  - Understanding psychosocial factors of prescribing
• 100% of respondents agreed on the need for a standardized curriculum

WHAT WE'RE BUILDING

To address these gaps, we're developing an AI-powered adaptive learning platform
that provides individualized feedback to fellows on complex ASP scenarios. The AI
evaluates responses across four competency domains: data analysis, behavioral
intervention, implementation science, and clinical decision making.

WHY WE NEED YOUR EXPERTISE

Before launching this platform, we need expert validation to ensure the AI feedback
is clinically accurate and pedagogically sound. You have been specifically selected
because of your recognized expertise in antimicrobial stewardship.

YOUR INPUT WILL:
✓ Directly improve AI feedback quality for fellows nationwide
✓ Help validate a novel approach to ASP education
✓ Inform development of standardized training competencies

WHAT WE'RE ASKING

Please review 1-2 samples of AI-generated feedback (10-15 minutes each) and provide:
1. Your expert correction - what would YOU say instead?
2. What the AI missed or overlooked
3. Your reasoning for the changes

We've attached a sample scenario below for your first review.

PUBLICATION & CO-AUTHORSHIP OPPORTUNITY

We plan to publish a manuscript describing this curriculum development and
validation process in a peer-reviewed medical education or infectious diseases
journal. All experts who provide substantive input (≥3 reviews) will be offered
co-authorship on the manuscript.

REVIEW FORM: [INSERT YOUR GOOGLE FORM LINK]

SAMPLE SCENARIO FOR REVIEW #1:

─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Scenario: CICU Prolonged Antibiotics - Data Analysis (Beginner)

You're a new ASP fellow reviewing antibiotic use in the cardiac ICU. You notice
that meropenem and vancomycin are frequently used for prolonged durations. The
CICU director has asked you to analyze the data and present findings.

FELLOW'S RESPONSE:
"I would start by calculating the DOT (days of therapy) for the CICU to understand
our baseline antibiotic use. Then I'd compare it to national benchmarks to see if
we're using too many antibiotics. If we are, I'd work with the team to reduce use."

AI-GENERATED FEEDBACK:
"Good approach! You've identified the key metric (DOT) and the importance of
benchmarking. Calculating DOT and comparing to national standards is the right
first step for antimicrobial stewardship data analysis.

Your plan to 'work with the team' shows awareness of the collaborative nature
of ASP interventions.

To strengthen this response:
- Consider which specific benchmark you'd use (NHSN, SHARPS, or institution-specific)
- Think about how you'd present the data to make it compelling
- What timeframe would you analyze?

Overall, this is a solid foundational approach. Score: 3/5"
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

PLEASE COMPLETE THE REVIEW FORM WITH:
• What feedback would YOU provide instead?
• What did the AI miss that an expert would emphasize?
• Was the AI feedback accurate and helpful?

## Option 3: Brief Email + Form Description

**Use this shorter email that relies on the form description for details:**

```
Subject: Expert Review Invitation - ASP AI Curriculum Development

Dear Dr. [Name],

You have been selected to contribute expert review for a national ASP fellowship
curriculum development project, based on your recognized expertise in antimicrobial

## Recommended Approach

**I recommend a two-part strategy:**

### Part 1: Update Google Form Description
Replace the current form description with **Option 1** text above. This ensures:
- Every expert sees the context regardless of email version
- The form is self-contained and can be shared independently
- Motivation is clear when experts share the link with colleagues

### Part 2: Use Enhanced Email Invitation
Use **Option 2** (comprehensive email) for your initial outreach to build engagement, then use **Option 3** (brief email) for follow-up requests or when experts are referred by others.
