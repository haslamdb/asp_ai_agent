📚 The Four Teaching Modules (Aligned with Table 1)
I've designed complete teaching frameworks for each advanced competency:
Module 1: Leadership & Program Management

Scenarios: Business case → Multi-stakeholder program → System-wide initiative
Pedagogy: Socratic coaching + change management framework
Assessment: Rubric covering stakeholder analysis, ROI, data strategy, implementation

Module 2: Data Analytics & Interpretation

Scenarios: DOT calculations → Trend analysis with confounding → System benchmarking
Pedagogy: Graduated practice + interpretation coaching
Assessment: Rubric for calculation accuracy, trend interpretation, benchmarking

Module 3: Behavioral Science & Communication

Scenarios: Identify cognitive biases → Design intervention → Multi-layer system change
Pedagogy: Role-play + behavior change frameworks
Assessment: Rubric for bias recognition, communication strategy, intervention design

Module 4: Advanced Clinical Interventions

Scenarios: Antibiotic timeout protocols → Allergy de-labeling → Shortage management
Pedagogy: Protocol design + edge case analysis
Assessment: Safety, feasibility, equity considerations

🤖 Model Selection and Optimization

Based on performance testing (compare_models.py results):
- RECOMMENDED DEFAULT: gemma2:27b 
  - Fastest response time (12s vs 30-45s for larger models)
  - Similar evaluation quality to larger models
  - Efficient GPU usage (single GPU, leaves resources for other tasks)
  - Best balance for interactive training system

Model Fine-tuning Options (in order of practicality):

1. RAG + Prompt Engineering (RECOMMENDED START)
   - Build database of expert ASP evaluations
   - Retrieve relevant examples for each scenario
   - Use as few-shot prompts for consistent, high-quality feedback
   - No GPU training required, immediate improvements

2. Custom Ollama Modelfiles
   - Create specialized system prompts and parameters
   - Example: ollama create asp-evaluator -f ./Modelfile
   - Customize temperature, examples, response format
   - Quick iteration, no retraining needed

3. Fine-tune Smaller Models (7B-9B)
   - Train gemma2:9b or llama3.1:8b with your GPUs
   - Use Axolotl, LLaMA-Factory, or Unsloth frameworks
   - Import to Ollama: ollama create my-asp-model -f ./Modelfile
   - Feasible with A5000+A6000 hardware

4. LoRA/QLoRA Adapters
   - Train small adapters (~1% of model size)
   - Merge with base model or load dynamically
   - Lower memory requirements than full fine-tuning
   - Good for specialized domain adaptation

Note: Direct fine-tuning of 27B-72B models not feasible with current hardware (requires 4-8x inference memory for training).

💡 Current Status & Next Actions

COMPLETED FOUNDATION: All critical infrastructure is now operational:
- Persistent session management tracking learner progress
- Multi-turn conversations with context awareness
- Adaptive difficulty adjusting to individual mastery
- Standardized rubric scoring for consistent evaluation
- Equity analytics detecting and addressing disparities

IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:
1. Test the integrated system:
   python test_integration.py  # Validates all components

2. Start the enhanced server:
   ./start_local.sh  # Runs unified_server.py with all features

3. Access new endpoints:
   - POST /api/session/create - Create learner sessions
   - GET /api/session/current - View progress
   - POST /api/conversation/process - Multi-turn interactions
   - GET /api/equity/dashboard - View equity metrics

KEY ACHIEVEMENT: Transformed from stateless Q&A to fully adaptive, equity-aware educational platform ready for content development and pilot testing.
