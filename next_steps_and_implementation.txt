✅ What You've Built Well

Unified Backend - Excellent architecture routing to Claude, Gemini, Ollama, and PubMedBERT
Hybrid RAG Model - Combines cloud LLM reasoning + local grounded citations; pedagogically sound
Module Structure - Directly addresses the gaps from Table 1 of the manuscript
Graceful Failover - Model switching prevents single points of failure


⚠️ Critical Gaps (in priority order)

📚 The Four Teaching Modules (Aligned with Table 1)
I've designed complete teaching frameworks for each advanced competency:
Module 1: Leadership & Program Management

Scenarios: Business case → Multi-stakeholder program → System-wide initiative
Pedagogy: Socratic coaching + change management framework
Assessment: Rubric covering stakeholder analysis, ROI, data strategy, implementation

Module 2: Data Analytics & Interpretation

Scenarios: DOT calculations → Trend analysis with confounding → System benchmarking
Pedagogy: Graduated practice + interpretation coaching
Assessment: Rubric for calculation accuracy, trend interpretation, benchmarking

Module 3: Behavioral Science & Communication

Scenarios: Identify cognitive biases → Design intervention → Multi-layer system change
Pedagogy: Role-play + behavior change frameworks
Assessment: Rubric for bias recognition, communication strategy, intervention design

Module 4: Advanced Clinical Interventions

Scenarios: Antibiotic timeout protocols → Allergy de-labeling → Shortage management
Pedagogy: Protocol design + edge case analysis
Assessment: Safety, feasibility, equity considerations


🚀 Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1 (8 weeks): Foundation

Session management + User progress tracking
Multi-turn conversation context
PubMedBERT citation integration
Module 1 prototype complete

Phase 2 (12 weeks): Learning Optimization

Adaptive difficulty engine
Rubric-based scoring
Complete Modules 2-3

Phase 3 (8 weeks): Validation & Scale

Module 4 complete
Pilot with 1-2 programs
Equity dashboards operational

Total: ~28 weeks (6-7 months) to full curriculum + working pilots

💡 Key Insight
Your platform has excellent technical foundations. The path forward is to add persistence, context, and personalization. Once fellows can have multi-turn conversations where the AI remembers context and adapts based on mastery, you'll have a genuinely transformative learning system that can scale across all 65 pediatric ID fellowship programs.
Start with Phase 1 (session management + multi-turn context). This unlocks adaptive learning and scaffolded feedback—the most powerful pedagogical levers.
