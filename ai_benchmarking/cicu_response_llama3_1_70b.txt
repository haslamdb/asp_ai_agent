**Comprehensive Intervention: "Optimizing Antibiotic Use in CICU"**

**Phase 1: Data-Driven Approach (Weeks 1-4)**

1. **Retrospective Chart Review**: Analyze 100 randomly selected patients who received meropenem+vancomycin combination therapy, focusing on:
	* Clinical outcomes (mortality, length of stay, readmission rates)
	* Culture results and antibiotic duration
	* Comparison of patients with negative cultures at 48 hours vs. those with positive cultures
2. **Development of a Data Dashboard**: Create a dashboard to track key metrics, including:
	* Antibiotic usage (DOT/1000 patient days)
	* Average treatment duration
	* Proportion of patients with negative cultures at 48 hours who continue antibiotics
	* Excess medication cost savings
3. **Present Findings to CICU Leadership**: Share the results of the chart review and dashboard data to demonstrate the safety and potential benefits of optimizing antibiotic use.

**Phase 2: Behavioral Change Strategies (Weeks 5-12)**

1. **Antibiotic Stewardship Team Formation**: Establish a multidisciplinary team, including ASP fellow, CICU attendings, pharmacists, and nurses, to promote education and collaboration.
2. **Prescriber Education and Feedback**:
	* Provide regular feedback on individual prescribers' antibiotic usage patterns
	* Offer educational sessions on optimal antibiotic use, de-escalation strategies, and the importance of antimicrobial stewardship
3. **Development of CICU-Specific Guidelines**: Create guidelines for meropenem+vancomycin combination therapy, including:
	* Indications for initiation
	* De-escalation criteria
	* Recommended treatment duration

**Phase 3: Implementation Plan (Weeks 13-24)**

1. **Implementation of Antibiotic Stewardship Interventions**: Launch the following interventions:
	* Prospective audit and feedback on meropenem+vancomycin combination therapy
	* Mandatory antibiotic time-out at 48 hours to reassess need for continuation
	* Empiric therapy guidelines with recommended duration
2. **Monitoring and Feedback**: Continue to track key metrics using the data dashboard and provide regular feedback to prescribers.
3. **Quarterly Progress Meetings**: Schedule meetings with CICU leadership and the antibiotic stewardship team to discuss progress, address concerns, and adjust strategies as needed.

**Addressing Hierarchy and Fear-Based Prescribing**

1. **Engage Senior Attendings in the Antibiotic Stewardship Team**: Encourage senior attendings to participate in guideline development and education sessions.
2. **Identify and Address Concerns**: Regularly solicit feedback from prescribers, including senior attendings, to address concerns and provide reassurance about the safety of optimized antibiotic use.
3. **Lead by Example**: Demonstrate a commitment to antimicrobial stewardship through visible leadership support and participation in education sessions.

**Sustainability Mechanisms**

1. **Embed Antibiotic Stewardship into CICU Culture**: Incorporate antibiotic stewardship principles into resident and fellow education, as well as CICU policies and procedures.
2. **Regular Review and Revision of Guidelines**: Schedule regular review and revision of guidelines to ensure they remain up-to-date and effective.
3. **Continued Data Collection and Feedback**: Maintain the data dashboard and provide ongoing feedback to prescribers to sustain behavior change.

**Resistance from Senior Attendings**

1. **Address Concerns through Education and Data**: Provide evidence-based education and share data demonstrating the safety and benefits of optimized antibiotic use.
2. **Involve Senior Attendings in Decision-Making**: Encourage senior attendings to participate in guideline development and decision-making processes to foster ownership and engagement.
3. **Escalation Plan**: Establish a clear escalation plan for addressing concerns or resistance, including involvement of department leadership or hospital administration if necessary.

**Timeline**

* Weeks 1-4: Data-driven approach and dashboard development
* Weeks 5-12: Behavioral change strategies and guideline development
* Weeks 13-24: Implementation and monitoring
* Quarterly progress meetings to review data and adjust strategies as needed

**Metrics for Evaluation**

1. Reduction in DOT/1000 patient days for meropenem+vancomycin combination therapy
2. Decrease in average treatment duration
3. Proportion of patients with negative cultures at 48 hours who discontinue antibiotics
4. Excess medication cost savings
