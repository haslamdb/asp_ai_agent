    "abstract": "The emergency department (ED) is increasingly recognized as a critical site for antimicrobial stewardship, where most initial antibiotic decisions occur, and emergency physicians (EPs), previously regarded as primarily focused on empiric treatment, are now emerging as leaders. Policy milestones, including accreditation standards and national guidelines, have catalyzed this transition, yet physician roles remain heterogeneous, and evidence on long-term outcomes is limited. Drawing on English-language literature, including intervention studies, descriptive reports, and policy documents, this editorial highlights how EPs contribute through guideline development, audit and feedback, culture follow-up, formulary oversight, rapid diagnostics, and educational initiatives. Evidence consistently shows improvements in prescribing appropriateness, reduced use of broad-spectrum agents, and faster optimization without compromising safety. However, barriers such as time pressure, professional culture, role ambiguity, and limited resources remain persistent. Importantly, the leadership of EPs has proven central in overcoming these obstacles, especially when supported by institutional commitment and integrated workflows. Their engagement is not only improving immediate prescribing practices but also represents a critical frontline defense against antimicrobial resistance and multidrug-resistant organisms. Looking forward, formalizing physician leadership, embedding stewardship in emergency medicine training, and building ED-specific data systems are essential to sustain safe and effective antibiotic use.",

    "abstract": "Excessive use of postoperative prophylactic antibiotics in children's hospitals is a significant public health concern, leading to increased risks of infections like Clostridioides difficile, multidrug-resistant organisms, and unnecessary healthcare costs. Antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs) are designed to optimize antibiotic use, but ideal strategies for implementing evidence-based guidelines remain unclear. We tested facilitation, a dynamic process where trained individuals support healthcare personnel in bridging evidence-practice gaps, as a promising strategy for the de-implementation of unnecessary postoperative antibiotics in healthcare. The OPerAtiC trial employed a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled design across nine hospitals to compare the effectiveness of two ASP-led strategies, specifically order set changes to align with antibiotic guidelines (baseline arm) and facilitation training (intervention arm). Facilitation workshops were informed by the i-PARIHS framework, emphasizing context analysis, evidence application, and recipient engagement; and were conducted remotely. Data were collected from 2019 to 2024, involving interviews with stewardship team members every two months. Data collected included proximal implementation outcomes of each ASP team member (acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness), intermediate outcomes (facilitation skill use) reported by the ASP team, and order set change completion rates. Proximal implementation outcomes for both strategies were rated high across all study phases, indicating strong baseline enthusiasm among participants (N\u2009=\u200930). Key facilitation skills-effective communication, conflict resolution, and data presentation-were pivotal for successful implementation. Most order set changes (76%) were completed post-facilitation, targeting various specialties and achieving reductions or eliminations in antibiotic use. Facilitation was associated with significantly more completed order sets targeting antibiotic reduction (p\u2009=\u20090.01), suggesting a potential pathway to improve the appropriateness of antibiotic use through implementation strategies. Facilitation is a valuable approach in refining ASP efforts, contributing to the successful reduction and de-implementation of unnecessary antibiotic use in children's hospitals. The study underscores the need for ongoing training and support for ASP teams to enhance their effectiveness in promoting appropriate antibiotic-prescribing practices. Future research should explore the long-term impacts of facilitation on antibiotic stewardship and patient outcomes.

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) education plays a vital role in addressing antimicrobial resistance (AMR), yet its long-term impact on behavior and clinical outcomes remains underexplored. Educational interventions are often assessed through knowledge-based outcomes, with limited evaluation of sustained practice changes or patient-level results, and standardized higher-level outcome measures across diverse healthcare settings. This scoping review aimed to map pre-post AMS healthcare educational interventions using the Kirkpatrick Model, evaluating their effectiveness across its four levels: reaction, learning, behavior, and results. The goal was to identify trends, highlight gaps, and provide insight into reported outcomes, delivery methods, and evaluation tools, supporting future research and strengthening the evidence base for AMS education. This review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute framework. A literature search of nine databases identified studies from 2010 to 2024. Eligible studies included pre-post AMS educational interventions targeting undergraduate students and healthcare professionals (HCPs) and reporting outcomes which were subsequently mapped by the reviewers to the Kirkpatrick Model. Data were categorized by target population, delivery format, and evaluation tools. Narrative synthesis was used to describe trends and relationships. Studies targeted HCPs such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and dental professionals, and undergraduate students in pharmacy, medicine, nursing, and dentistry. Sixty-three studies were included. Outcomes were distributed across Level 1 (Reaction) (n\u2009=\u200946, 24%), Level 2 (Learning) (n\u2009=\u200951, 27%), Level 3 (Behavior) (n\u2009=\u200950, 26%), and Level 4 (Results) (n\u2009=\u200945, 23%). While n\u2009=\u200924 (38%) assessed all four levels, another n\u2009=\u200924 (38%) reported mixed or partial levels. Face-to-face or online-only formats achieved Levels 1 and 2. Whereas blended or workplace-integrated interventions more often demonstrated behavior change and clinical outcomes (Levels 3 and 4). Longitudinal follow-up and mixed evaluation tools (e.g., surveys, chart reviews, interviews) supported higher-level impacts. Pharmacy-led, interdisciplinary, and contextually tailored interventions mapped to all levels. AMS education often leads to short-term learning gains, but fewer interventions achieve sustained behavior change or measurable clinical outcomes. Blended and practice-integrated formats, paired with long-term evaluation, are key to realizing the full potential of AMS education. Embedding such approaches in undergraduate and professional programs can better prepare the future HCPs to address AMR effectively.",

Also, to assess whether these curricula meet WHO recommendations and identify any gaps compared with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) antimicrobial prescribing and stewardship competency framework. A search for online education resources was carried out to identify UG curricula or CFs for HCPs for AMS or antimicrobial resistance applicable to the UK. Seven curricula or CFs were identified and reviewed. One AMS CF for all UG health workers, three for pharmacy UG students, one nursing AMS CF, one medical AMS CF, and the pathology curriculum. Domains varied between them but significant overlap was identified, and the majority of knowledge objectives in the WHO modules were covered in all UG curricula/CFs (except those objectives listed under the role of laboratory staff, which were only in the pathology curriculum). Gaps were identified between the most recently published UG curricula for pharmacists and the UKHSA antimicrobial prescribing and stewardship CF. There is significant correlation between the UG curricula/CFs for HCPs in the UK, the WHO curricula guide, and UKHSA antimicrobial prescribing and stewardship CF; however, there are some identified gaps. Despite the availability of UG curricula and/or CFs for the majority of HCPs, these are not consistently embedded in UG training.",

The programme included online and live courses covering relevant AMS learning goals. Participants also carried out a local AMS project using a determinant analysis with pre- and post-intervention measurements. Data were collected through surveys, exams, and an evaluation of mandatory reports to assess progress across Kirkpatrick's four levels of learning: reaction, learning, behaviour and results. Forty participants from 22 countries took part in the programme. Individual courses were positively evaluated (reaction, level 1). All participants passed the final exam (learning, level 2). After 2 years, 35/40 (88%) submitted their AMS project reports (behaviour, level 3). In 31/35 (89%) of projects a post-intervention measurement was performed, of which 26/31 (84%) showed a positive effect on either process outcomes (e.g. increase in guideline adherence), quantity outcomes (e.g. reduced broad-spectrum antibiotic use), or patient outcomes (e.g. length of stay) (results, level 4).

    "abstract": "If antibiotics are used appropriately, the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) can be curbed. Many medical students feel that they do not receive sufficient training in this respect during their undergraduate medical education. In recent years, digital learning formats are being successfully employed in student teaching. Our aim was to develop and evaluate a massive open online course (MOOC) on appropriate antibiotic therapy and the development of AMR. The intention was to provide the MOOC as an effective learning format in medical schools and to encourage others to develop their own MOOCs on other topics. We developed a MOOC for medical students that consisted of four modules (M1-4) on bacteriology, microbiology diagnostics, pharmacology, antibiotics, AMR, the One Health approach, principles of appropriate antibiotic therapy, and transfer of knowledge to clinical practice. MOOC learners were asked to answer the same 16 knowledge and five self-assessment questions at the beginning and end of the MOOC and to give course feedback in an anonymous online questionnaire. From July 1, 2021 until June 30, 2022 the MOOC was actively attended by 2061 learners. Of them, 473 (23%) completed the final exam and 389 (19%) answered the knowledge and self-assessment questions at the beginning and end of the MOOC. A significant increase in knowledge and a strengthening of competence and self-confidence was observed in these 389 learners. The median knowledge score increased significantly from 10/16 (IQR 8; 12) points before the MOOC to 16/16 (15; 16) afterwards (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Overall, course activity decreased from M1 (100% attendance) to M4 (38%). At the end of the MOOC, the online feedback questionnaire was completed by 304 (15%) learners, most of whom rated the MOOC positively. For example, 97% of them stated that they had increased their knowledge in relevant areas. A high dropout rate for voluntary MOOCs is generally reported. Therefore, a course completion rate of 23% is acceptable. The learners who completed the MOOC showed a significant increase in knowledge and self-confidence. The use of the MOOC, or parts of it, as digital learning format for undergraduate medical education appears promising.",

Pediatric antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) face implementation challenges, often relying on adult-based guidelines and limited pediatric-specific evidence. This study aimed to identify and prioritize the most critical areas for pediatric ASP intervention development through a structured, multi-round Delphi consensus process with experts in antimicrobial stewardship and infectious diseases. A four-round modified Delphi process was conducted to identify and prioritize key pediatric ASP interventions. Experts in antimicrobial stewardship and infectious diseases were recruited through an existing clinical trial. Using an iterative survey and in-person discussions, experts provided input on priority areas, which were thematically grouped and refined across rounds. Structured feedback supported real-time refinement and consensus-building. Twenty experts participated in the process, generating 25 priority items in Round 1 through open-ended responses. These were narrowed to seven key priorities through structured voting and discussion. The final items were clustered into three intersecting themes: Care Settings, Prescriptions, and Strategies. Care Settings focused on high-impact areas such as outpatient clinics and intensive care units, where misuse is common and/or care is complex. The prescriptions theme prioritized shorter durations and narrow-spectrum agents. The strategy theme highlighted the need for outcome-based metrics, improved diagnostic stewardship, and routine tracking of patient outcomes to guide and assess stewardship efforts. This expert consensus identified key priorities for pediatric ASPs, providing a foundation for future interventions. Findings can be used to inform policy and practice, improving the appropriate use of antimicrobials in pediatrics and combating AMR.",

Overuse and inappropriate prescription of antifungal (AF) agents have been reported in pediatrics, leading not only to an increase in adverse events and toxicities but also to the development of AF resistance. AF stewardship practices as part of broader antimicrobial stewardship programs are crucial for improving outcomes and reducing AF overuse and associated costs. This review has two main objectives: to summarize the published data on prescription patterns of AF agents in pediatrics and to describe the current state of pediatric AF stewardship programs worldwide, providing suggestions for their implementation. Given the significant burden of invasive fungal infections in vulnerable pediatric populations, identification of actions to improve AF stewardship practices in real-life clinical settings is essential.",

MUEs can explore safety concerns, high costs, or inappropriate use associated with any medication, among other factors. This can offer a valuable opportunity for Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASPs) to promote stewardship goals, which often overlap with these concerns for specific antimicrobials. MUEs can also provide an avenue to promote interdisciplinary collaboration with targeted groups relevant to the ASP's goals as well as an opportunity to give trainees ownership of system-facing stewardship projects. Stewardship pharmacists may often have experience with leading this process as part of their training, but MUEs represent a gap in training for physicians. Here we provide guidance on how stewardship physicians can engage in the MUE process, from identifying relevant topics to interpreting findings and supporting implementation efforts, allowing them to contribute effectively even without prior MUE experience.",

    "authors": "Lynch C",
    "year": 2025,
    "journal": "Cureus",
    "abstract": "Introduction Antibiotic stewardship is becoming critically important as resistant bacteria become increasingly prevalent. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as a major global health challenge, driven in part by the misuse and overuse of antibiotics. An acute sore throat is one of the most frequent reasons for patients to seek medical care, yet only a minority of cases require antibiotic treatment. Despite this, inappropriate prescribing is rife, often influenced by diagnostic uncertainty, patient expectations, and non-clinical pressures. These challenges highlight the importance of reinforcing evidence-based strategies, such as the use of Centor criteria, to support accurate assessment and reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing in patients presenting with a sore throat. This quality improvement project evaluated adherence to Centor criteria and subsequent antibiotic prescribing in an accident and emergency (A&E) department in the Northwest of England, before and after clinician education on NICE guidance and documentation of Centor criteria. Materials and methods One hundred patients presenting with an acute sore throat between January and March 2023 were identified. Electronic patient data were collected retrospectively to analyze the documentation's adherence to NICE guidelines and Modified Centor criteria. Results Pre-intervention, 16% of clinicians documented all Centor criteria, 48% incorrectly prescribed antibiotics, and only 20% prescribed appropriate antibiotics. Through post-intervention teaching and literature dissemination, the figures changed to 54%, 22%, and 56%, respectively. Conclusion Targeted clinician education and adherence to NICE guidelines improved antibiotic prescribing for the acute sore throat, underscoring the value of audit cycles while highlighting the need for sustained, larger-scale efforts to reduce AMR.",

Prospective audit and feedback, a core aspect of antibiotic stewardship program (ASP) efforts, reduces such use, but is inefficient in the absence of a pre-screening process. To address this, we used a machine learning approach to stratify antibiotic orders based on the likelihood of benefiting from ASP review, and to identify the factors most influential in the model's predictions. Machine learning model developed using expert-labeled point-prevalence data. Single-center adult academic hospital. Hospitalized patients 18 years or older on internal medicine services between May 2021 and August 2022. Infectious disease experts assessed antibiotic orders for necessity and optimal use to create labels which were used as ground truth to train a machine learning model that uses automatically queried data from the electronic health record including vital signs, laboratory values, microbiological data, and medication administration records. Our model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89 for antibiotic necessity and 0.80 for optimal use. Model predictions were driven largely by markers of clinical instability, inflammation, and infection. Simpler clinical indices of infection had no predictive ability. We describe a model that predicts antibiotic necessity and optimal use using routinely available data that can be automatically aggregated from medical records. This makes it a promising option for early identification and intervention on orders most likely to benefit from ASP review.",

It is estimated that, in certain situations, up to 80% of antibiotic prescriptions in dentistry may be inappropriate. The aim of this study was to explore Spanish dentists' attitudes, perceptions, and contextual factors influencing antibiotic use and misuse in clinical practice. From July to December 2022, we conducted focus groups with 31 dentists from Spain Data were analysed using thematic analysis with a pragmatic orientation to address the research objectives. Inclusion criteria required participants to be dentistry graduates or oral medicine specialists (stomatologists) and actively working as dentists. The sample was selected through key informants and the snowball method. We ensured methodological quality by adhering to the COREQ checklist. We formed seven synchronous online focus groups with 31 participants. Dentists acknowledged the problem of antibiotic resistance, identifying fear, working conditions and burnout and patient trust as factors contributing to inappropriate prescribing. Despite this awareness, dentists did not see themselves as key agents of change in combating antibiotic resistance. However, they expressed interest in further education on the topic. These findings underscore the need for educational interventions that highlight dentists' role in antimicrobial stewardship. By situating these interventions within the One Health framework, dentists can be empowered to translate their leadership in oral health into active participation in the prudent use of antibiotics. Strengthening this role has practical implications for multidisciplinary strategies to combat antimicrobial resistance.",

A total of 330 dairy farmers participated in the study, and single-stage cluster sampling was performed, followed by probability proportional to size sampling. A semi-structured, validated questionnaire and a checklist were used to collect the data. Only a few dairy farmers knew about antimicrobials (33%) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) (10.9%). All 330 dairy farmers were using antimicrobials. The factors that influenced dairy farmers' decisions to use antimicrobials for their cattle were veterinarian advice (100%), para-veterinarian advice (96.3%), peer influence (31.2%), and previous experience of using antimicrobials (12.4%). None of them were aware of the drug withdrawal period and followed it. Significant differences in completing the full course of antimicrobial treatment as prescribed have been observed with increasing levels of education ( Despite the wide usage of antimicrobials in dairy farms, there was a significant lack of knowledge among dairy farmers regarding antimicrobials and AMR. The study emphasizes the need for targeted educational interventions to improve farmers' understanding of antimicrobial use and resistance, promote responsible practices, and enhance animal health management.",

    "journal": "Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",
    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing threat to global health, accelerated by the widespread inappropriate use of antibiotics. Although educational initiatives have been launched worldwide, there is little evidence on how younger generations in high-income countries (HICs) understand and address AMR. Addressing the AMR crisis requires proactive education of younger generations, including children, adolescents, and young adults, who will shape future healthcare practices. This review analyzes existing research on AMR literacy among these age groups in HICs, as knowledge gaps and risky behaviors persist even in HICs, despite their strong education and health infrastructures. The purpose of this review is to examine the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance in younger generations while identifying effective educational interventions. We performed a comprehensive literature search in PubMed until June 2025, followed by AI-assisted screening (Claude 4.0 Sonnet) and a manual review. The search strategy combined terms from the areas of health literacy, antibiotics, antibiotic resistance/AMR, and young populations. Studies in HICs that examined the younger generation's knowledge about antibiotics and AMR, analyzed their attitudes or behavior toward them, or evaluated relevant educational interventions were included. Data were synthesized thematically across all included studies. Nineteen studies from 11 HICs were included, including thirteen cross-sectional surveys and six educational intervention studies. The results showed that misconceptions about how antibiotics work are still very common. Several of those asked (22-80%) incorrectly stated that resistance develops in the human body and not in bacteria. Many (26-77%) mistakenly agreed with the statement that antibiotics treat viral infections. Concerning behaviors included high rates of self-medication, non-adherence to treatment, and unsafe storage practices. Several authors propose an amendment of curricula. Educational interventions, particularly gamification and peer education approaches, showed improvements in knowledge and sustained learning outcomes. Knowledge of AMR among young people in HICs is still inadequate, despite educational advantages. Most existing studies focus on college students, while children and adolescents, crucial groups for early prevention, are underrepresented.

    "abstract": "The optimal treatment modality for diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) remains unclear. The current guidelines from Diabetes Canada recommend the use of oral antibiotics and/or intravenous antibiotics with no preferred agent or route of administration. This report aimed to evaluate the current evidence surrounding oral antibiotic therapy for DFO. Embase and MEDLINE databases were searched for original articles written in English that reported efficacy and safety data on oral antibiotic use for this indication. Twenty-six unique studies were included, encompassing 972 patients treated with oral antibiotics. The mean age was 64.6 years (range: 30 to 90\u00a0y). When used as monotherapy, the complete resolution and partial resolution rate for oral antibiotic therapy were 75.2% (539/717) and 3.2% (23/717), respectively. When used as a step-down therapy after intravenous antibiotics, the complete and partial resolution rate for oral antibiotics were 56.5% (155/255) and 20.4% (52/255), respectively. No resolution of DFO resulting in refractory infection or amputation was observed in 155 (21.6%) cases of oral antibiotics monotherapy and 59 (23.1%) of step-down therapy. Recurrence rates for oral antibiotics monotherapy and step-down therapy were 5.4% (39/717) and 3.9% (10/255), respectively. Oral antibiotic therapy demonstrates favorable outcomes in DFO comparable to intravenous treatment. Oral antibiotic therapy may be especially useful in low-resource settings where hospital beds are limited and in situations where patients require ambulation. Nonetheless, patients should be counselled on the vital importance of adherence, and resource stewardship should be practiced by health care providers to avoid antibiotic resistance. To present a systematic review article evaluating the utility of oral antibiotics for the treatment of diabetic foot osteomyelitis. This continuing education activity is intended for physicians; physician assistants; nurse practitioners; podiatrists/other foot specialists; and nurses with an interest in skin, wound, and diabetic foot care. After completing this continuing education activity, the participant should be better able to:Summarize the evidence the authors considered when evaluating the utility of oral antibiotics for diabetic foot osteomyelitis.Select the characteristics of the participants and settings in which oral antibiotic therapy was utilized.Identify the results of the authors' study assessing the use of oral antibiotics.Discuss\ufeff potential situations in which oral antibiotic therapy may provide favorable outcomes as monotherapy or in conjunction with intravenous antibiotics for diabetic foot osteomyelitis.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the knowledge and confidence of pharmacy students in their final professional year regarding beta-lactam (BL) allergies. Students from 5 schools of pharmacy participated in a 22-question survey pertaining to experience with drug allergies, knowledge of BL allergies, and confidence regarding BL allergy management. Data were summarized among all respondents and further analyzed by infectious disease (ID) interest. A total of 160/521 students responded to the survey (31%). Most students (73%) had no course dedicated to drug allergies; however, 84% indicated the topic was taught within the curriculum. Students with an ID interest had a higher perceived knowledge regarding the details of penicillin skin testing (62% vs. 32%), clinical implications of penicillin skin test results (87% vs. 70%), and the principles behind a graded and direct penicillin challenge (64% vs. 41%). These students were more confident in educating patients about a perceived penicillin allergy (34% vs. 15%). Perceived knowledge and confidence of BL allergies were low, especially in high-level interventions. Targeted training in beta-lactam allergy recognition and management within the curriculum should be considered to improve upon these findings.",

The American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Urgent Care Medicine and Pediatric Acute and Critical Care Quality Network developed a multicenter quality improvement collaborative. We used national guidelines to determine criteria for nonsevere AOM and first-line antibiotics for AOM and pharyngitis. Participating UCCs committed at least 3 clinicians to submit 10 encounters for each diagnosis per month during the intervention period (October 2022 to June 2023). Clinicians signed commitment letters, participated in monthly learning sessions, and tested UCC-selected interventions. We recruited 84 participants from 13 UCCs. Participants submitted 5017 AOM encounters and 3762 pharyngitis encounters. The use of first-line antibiotics for AOM and GAS pharyngitis remained stable at 75.7% and 79.9%, respectively, throughout the project. The documentation of delayed antibiotic criteria increased from a range of 26%-27% at baseline to 83% [5.42% per month (95% CI: 4.03-6.81)]. This corresponded to an increase in use of delayed antibiotics for AOM from a range of 32%-42% at baseline to 70% by the end of the intervention period [2.53% per month (95% CI: 0.57-4.48)]. Rates of GAS testing before treating pharyngitis increased during baseline and remained high (>96%) throughout the intervention period. This multicenter collaborative provided education and networking to increase the use of delayed antibiotics for AOM in pediatric UCCs.",

Forty-nine general practices in the South of England each hosted a 1\u2005h in-house workshop, facilitated by trained local pharmacy professionals. This type of educational outreach approach using TARGET (Target Antibiotics Responsibly, Guidance, Education and Tools) antibiotic materials has previously been shown to reduce antibiotic dispensing in a UK primary care setting. The workshop included a review of antibiotic prescribing data, a presentation on paediatric AMS showcasing locally agreed paediatric prescribing guidelines and safety-netting resources from the Healthier Together website, and formulation of a local action plan. The primary outcome measure was total oral antibiotic prescriptions ('items') dispensed per 1000 patients aged under 5\u2005years for the year after the workshop, compared with the previous year's dispensing. The median prescribing rate for children under 5\u2005years of age changed from a baseline of 48.9 per 1000 patients prior to the intervention to a new median monthly prescribing rate of 39.0 per 1000 patients following the intervention. There was no increase in paediatric presentations to primary care following the intervention. This low-cost intervention has the potential to reduce primary care antibiotic prescribing in children and we did not detect an increase in GP attendance rates after this intervention in our study. It could easily be rolled out nationwide.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in microbiome research have highlighted the oral cavity as a complex and dynamic ecosystem, home to over 700 microbial species that play critical roles in both oral and systemic health. The oral microbiota not only maintains local tissue homeostasis but also serves as a reservoir for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, contributing to the global spread of resistance. Frequent and sometimes inappropriate antibiotic use in dental practice, along with exposure to antiseptics and biocides, drives the emergence and horizontal transfer of resistance determinants within oral biofilms. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms and ecological drivers of AMR in the oral microbiome, emphasizing the clinical implications of dysbiosis and drug-resistant infections. The authors advocate for the development of dental clinical guidelines tailored to the unique characteristics of the oral microbiota, focusing on personalized therapy through molecular diagnostics, standardized AMR risk assessment, and the integration of non-antibiotic strategies such as probiotics and photodynamic therapy. Continuous education in antimicrobial stewardship and the implementation of oral-specific AMR surveillance is also highlighted as an essential component of effective resistance management. To support rational prescribing, a dedicated mobile application has been developed, leveraging microbiota data and resistance profiles to guide evidence-based, targeted therapy and reduce unnecessary antibiotic use.

    "abstract": "Strengthening antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programs is an invaluable intervention in the ongoing efforts to contain the threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), particularly in low-resource settings. This study evaluates the impact of the Telementoring, Education, and Advocacy Collaboration initiative for Health through Antimicrobial Stewardship (TEACH AMS), which uses the virtual Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) learning model to enhance AMS capacity in Kenya, Ghana, and Malawi. A mixed-methods approach was used, which included attendance data collection, facility-level assessments, post-session and follow-up surveys, as well as focus group discussions. Between September 2023 and February 2025, 77 virtual learning sessions were conducted, engaging 2445 unique participants from hospital-based AMS committees and health professionals across the three countries. Participants reported significant knowledge gain, and data showed facility improvements in two core AMS areas, including the implementation of multidisciplinary ward-based interventions/communications and enhanced monitoring of antibiotic resistance patterns. Along those lines, participants reported that the program assisted them in improving prescribing and culture-based treatments, and also evidence-informed antibiotic selection. The evidence of implementing ward-based interventions was further stressed in focus group discussions, as well as other strengthened practices like point-prevalence surveys, and development or revision of stewardship policies. Substantial improvements in microbiology services were also shared by participants, particularly in Malawi. Other practices mentioned were strengthened multidisciplinary communication, infection prevention efforts, and education of patients and the community. Our findings suggest that a virtual case-based learning educational intervention, providing structured and tailored AMS capacity building, can drive behavior change and strengthen healthcare systems in low resource settings. Future efforts should aim to scale up the engagements and sustain improvements to further strengthen AMS capacity.",

Locally, 50-60% of patients had extended prophylaxis after pacemaker insertion or generator change. Our antimicrobial stewardship programme (ASP) incorporated behavioural change strategies in implementing a multi-pronged intervention bundle to address this and evaluated its effectiveness and safety. This single-centre, retrospective cohort study included patients aged 21 years old or older, undergoing uncomplicated pacemaker insertion or generator change at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) from October 2022 to March 2025. To improve antibiotic use, ASP interventions incorporating behaviour change strategies were implemented, namely (1) data-driven feedback, (2) targeted education, (3) identification and engagement of ASP champion, and (4) clinical pathway revision. There were 779 patients evaluated; 380 (48.8%) received standard prophylaxis while 399 (51.2%) received extended prophylaxis with oral antibiotics (mean duration, 3.3 \u00b1 0.8 days). Following ASP interventions, the practice of extended prophylaxis declined significantly from 43.8% to 24.0% ( The bundled ASP interventions, incorporating behavioural change strategies, have effectively and safely reduced the use of extended prophylaxis post-cardiac device implantation.

Evaluation of the quantity and appropriateness of common antifungal prescriptions like fluconazole is essential in the development of these programmes. To perform a clinical audit of fluconazole prescribing and explore whether involvement of pharmacy students in this process was feasible and meaningful from both pharmacy student and health system perspectives. An audit was conducted of all fluconazole prescriptions from January 2024 to March 2024 at two Sydney hospitals. Trained pharmacy students, under the supervision of antimicrobial stewardship pharmacists and physicians, completed the audit using the Antifungal National Antimicrobial Prescribing Survey audit tool. Prescriptions were assessed for their compliance to guidelines and appropriateness. Data on pharmacy students' educational experience was collected by a 5-point Likert scale survey. A total of 145 fluconazole prescriptions were audited: 34 for empiric therapy, 56 for directed therapy, and 56 for prophylaxis. A total of 91 (62.8%) prescriptions were assessed as appropriate, 46 (31.7%) were inappropriate, and 8 (5.5%) were not assessable. Potential drug-drug interactions were identified in 17 patients receiving fluconazole doses of 200\u00a0mg or greater, of which three were clinically significant, requiring intervention. Students had positive experiences contributing to quality use of medicines, in terms of enjoyment, support, and education. Inappropriate fluconazole use was common. Pharmacy students made a positive contribution to the antifungal audit, promoting good stewardship practises for the hospital while accessing enhanced learning and development opportunities. A multisite clinical audit of 145 fluconazole prescriptions found 62.8% were appropriate, 31.7% inappropriate. Pharmacy students played a vital role in the audit by identifying drug interactions and gaining valuable learning experiences. Their involvement supported antifungal stewardship efforts.",

Real-time microbiological information has been shown to have an impact on prognosis when combined with an antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) program. dRAST is a rapid commercial antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) system based on real-time microscopy. The primary outcome of this trial was to compare positive blood culture's time-to-result (TTR), defined as time from Gram stain to AST report, between dRAST and our standard of care in a real-life clinical setting. Secondary outcomes included microbiological concordance, time to antimicrobial stewardship recommendation (TAMS), and time to change antimicrobial prescription (TCAP) in agreement with AMS recommendation. We performed a prospective, open-label, randomized (1:1) diagnostic clinical trial comparing dRAST and our standard of care commercial MicroScan broth microdilution (MBMD) (MicroScan-Walkaway, Beckman-Coulter, USA) in 277 hospitalized patients with bacteremia.

A randomized diagnostic trial was designed to address this objective. Our findings show that the use of dRAST significantly reduces time-to-result, time to antimicrobial stewardship recommendations, and time to appropriate therapy changes, particularly in critically ill patients.

Game-based learning is an unconventional form of active learning and its use in education within the health sciences has been investigated. This study evaluated the use of a card game to teach antimicrobial use in dogs and cats with bacterial diseases as a supplement to traditional methods of teaching. This study found that third- and fourth-year veterinary students' comfort in antimicrobial decision-making increased for four infectious diseases following the inclusion of a card game during rounds. No similar improvement was noted for a disease that was not included in the card game. Students perceived that the game improved their understanding of antimicrobials in dogs and cats and students universally enjoyed playing the game. The role of games in veterinary medical education should be further explored, especially studies that evaluate knowledge retention throughout the duration of their educational experience.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is a significant global health issue, and Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) services in hospitals are key to addressing this. Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) are vital tools that support AMS programs. Guidance MS, a CDSS developed in 2005, has been implemented in over 60 Australian hospitals, yielding positive outcomes such as reduced gram-negative resistance, decreased antimicrobial consumption, and improved prescribing practices. This CDSS was redesigned to continue to support national AMS accreditation standards and meet evolving needs in digital healthcare. The CDSS included features for formulary restriction, clinical decision support, post-prescription review, auditing, and interactive reports for feedback. This paper outlines how the Learning Health System (LHS) framework was applied to redesign, develop, implement and evaluate the updated CDSS. The LHS framework operates through iterative cycles of practice-to-data, data-to-knowledge, and knowledge-to-practice. A Learning Health Community was established, which provided input to guide system design. Key considerations for the new CDSS included a user-centred approach, interoperability with electronic medical records (EMR), and adherence to national regulatory standards for Software As a Medical Device. Following an Agile development process, the redesigned system underwent extensive testing and iterative improvements. The program was then implemented in a beta site, a large, tertiary hospital. Extensive User Acceptance Testing was conducted, with feedback and improvements incorporated into the first version release. The program was then implemented in a network of thirteen hospitals. Formal and anecdotal feedback from the project team and clinicians showed high satisfaction regarding usability, performance, clinician workflow improvement, content quality, and efficiency. The LHS framework enabled user feedback to drive rapid enhancements to the program, ensuring it met identified needs. The implementation projects provided valuable insights into workflows, enhancing project delivery and informing strategies for future application improvements and scalability. Future development will include establishing two-way integration with EMRs and mobile devices. A socio-technical evaluation will assess the program's perceived usability and usefulness, supporting continuous improvement as part of LHS methodology. A formal evaluation will assess clinical impact on hospital and patient outcomes, providing evidence to guide ongoing optimisation.The LHS is a useful framework for designing, developing, implementing and evaluating digital healthcare solutions for AMS, which continues to inform improvements, enabling provision of an effective, scalable and sustainable, digital solution.",

Enhancing professionals' communication skills is one of the most promising interventions for optimising antibiotic prescription in respiratory tract infections in children. We developed a communication skills course for primary care paediatricians, paediatric nurses and community pharmacists. We conducted: 1) A scoping review, 2) brainstorming and selection of themes, 3) design of content, 4) user testing, through a survey and semi-structured interviews. A multidisciplinary advisory group gave feedback throughout the design and development process. We conducted a descriptive analysis of the survey results, and we used a predefined analytical framework for qualitative content. The course comprised four modules with nineteen themes, which included communication theoretical content, clinical cases, complementary reading, videos, and a glossary. It also included a forum and webinars, after each module. Sixteen users completed several themes and a survey, and eight were interviewed. They rated a mean of 4 or higher (5-point scale), across most of the domains evaluated. The videos received the highest rating (4.81; SD\u2009=\u20090.39). Suggestions for improvement included incorporating a workshop, and featuring more representation of other professionals. The majority of professionals (93%) expressed interest in completing the course. We developed a comprehensive, evidence-based online communication skills training course to optimise antibiotic prescribing in paediatric primary care. Integrating key communication strategies and insights from a scoping review, the course equips healthcare professionals with practical tools to enhance shared decision-making and antimicrobial stewardship.

    "abstract": "To highlight the unintended consequences of microbiological test results in driving inappropriate antimicrobial prescriptions, and to evaluate strategies - particularly from the perspective of diagnostic stewardship - that may mitigate this issue. Despite the critical role of microbiological data in guiding appropriate antimicrobial therapy, several studies have demonstrated that misinterpretation of such results frequently leads to unnecessary treatments. Common pitfalls include overinterpretation of positive cultures from poorly collected or clinically unwarranted samples, misclassification of colonization vs. infection, and excessive reliance on test results in the absence of supporting clinical evidence. Emerging diagnostic stewardship interventions - ranging from restricting sample processing and modifying test reporting to implementing decision support tools - have shown promising outcomes in reducing overtreatment without compromising patient safety. Specific examples include urine and wound cultures, respiratory specimens, and the diagnosis of Clostridioides difficile infection. Furthermore, educational and system-level strategies such as the BLADDER score or selective result reporting can improve decision-making at various stages of the diagnostic process. Microbiology laboratories play a pivotal role in antimicrobial stewardship and must actively support clinicians in avoiding diagnostic and therapeutic errors. While evidence supports multiple approaches to mitigate inappropriate prescriptions driven by microbiology results, their successful implementation requires interdisciplinary collaboration, tailored interventions, and ongoing evaluation of clinical impact. Diagnostic stewardship, when aligned with clinician education and robust reporting practices, is a crucial component in enhancing the accuracy of infection diagnosis and reducing antimicrobial overuse.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is a worldwide problem caused by the inappropriate use of antibiotics. In Australia, antibiotics are frequently prescribed in general practice (primary care) settings for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) despite these infections most commonly being caused by viruses. The Optimal Implementation of Antimicrobial Stewardship in General Practice (OptimasGP) study aims to provide implementation support for effective antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) interventions for ARIs. The current study will examine if a redesigned workflow, and an AMS Toolbox containing AMS resources, is an acceptable way to access AMS interventions and clinical data collected in general practice settings. A mixed-methods approach will be applied using a single-arm, pragmatic exploratory study. Data will be collected for a period of 3\u00a0months. Data collection from general practice settings in New South Wales, Australia, will involve the participation of 4 to 6 practices, 12 general practitioners (GPs), and 6 to 8 practice staff. We also aim to recruit 50-100 patients to complete surveys and 12 patients to participate in focus group discussions. Participating GPs and practice staff will be provided with an online AMS Toolbox to facilitate access to AMS resources. Two hours of online training and a reminder card will also be provided. The AMS Toolbox will contain AMS resources for shared decision-making, clinical decision support (including point-of-care testing), and delayed antibiotic prescribing in patients with ARIs. The primary outcome of the study will be the acceptability of the AMS Toolbox to GPs, practice staff, and patients. Secondary outcomes will include recruitment and completion rates, qualitative findings from the focus group discussions, resource use and antibiotic prescription rates, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), and patient-reported experience measures (PREMS). AMS interventions are needed to help reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for ARIs in general practice settings. The findings of this study will inform a hybrid type 3 implementation trial.

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASPs) and Diagnostic Stewardship Programs (DSPs) are essential for optimizing infectious disease management and addressing antimicrobial resistance (AMR). However, the implementation of pediatric ASPs presents distinct challenges that set them apart from adult-focused initiatives. Additionally, many existing ASP guidelines are primarily tailored to the U.S. healthcare system, requiring significant adaptation to fit the diverse healthcare infrastructures, resources, and prescribing practices across different countries. These factors highlight the need for context-specific strategies to ensure the effective implementation of pediatric ASPs worldwide. To develop a national, intersociety consensus on pediatric ASPs in Italy, an ASP steering committee was established, bringing together a multidisciplinary group of experts. A systematic scoping review was conducted to identify relevant literature on ASPs and DSPs published between 2007 and August 2024, retrieving 260 articles. Based on this evidence, 33 recommendations were formulated, covering general ASP and DSP principles (10 recommendations), ASP interventions (14), DSP interventions (3), and monitoring strategies (6). Consensus on the importance and feasibility of each recommendation was reached using the Delphi method, with two rounds of anonymous questionnaires. The steering group defined a priori criteria for recommendation acceptance, requiring at least 80% agreement on the importance of each item. This consensus highlights the critical role of a multidisciplinary approach in ASP implementation, supported by institutional leadership. Given the variability in healthcare systems, ASP interventions must be tailored to specific settings, considering factors such as hospital resources, patient complexity, and the parent-child dynamic. Standardized metrics for assessing the impact of ASPs are essential for benchmarking and ensuring sustainability, although data collection remains a significant challenge. While there was strong agreement on the importance of the recommendations, feasibility assessments identified key areas requiring further refinement, particularly in settings with limited pediatric-specific expertise and diagnostic tools. This national consensus provides a structured framework for the implementation of pediatric ASPs in Italy, equipping clinicians with essential tools to optimize antibiotic use in both inpatient and outpatient settings. It represents a foundational step toward improving pediatric ASP, fostering national and international collaboration, and guiding future research to address implementation barriers.",

Although numerous studies have postulated nursing as a potential mediator to address this problem, no research has been conducted to put it into practice. This study aims to contextualize the problem of inappropriate antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance, as well as to develop and implement a nurse-led educational intervention aimed at mitigating it, emphasizing the role of nurses in health education. Two different groups of participants were recruited using convenience sampling. Nurses administered a survey to 782 citizens in a population from Spain to assess their knowledge of the correct use of antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance. After completing the survey, nurses explained to the participants how to use antibiotics correctly and the problem of antimicrobial resistance. Furthermore, an educational intervention led by nurses was carried out with 104 adolescents, consisting of an oral presentation to raise awareness about the issue. The effectiveness of this intervention was evaluated through a comparative analysis before and after the activity (pre-test and post-test). Our results indicated that the level of knowledge about the correct use of antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance is not statistically significant related to sex in the general population ( These findings highlight the low level of knowledge in the population about the correct use of antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance.

    "abstract": "To examine the potential role of computerized clinical decision support systems (CDSS) in antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) and to identify significant challenges concerning their effectiveness and implementation. Narrative review. This review is based on existing literature regarding CDSS in AMS across various healthcare environments, such as hospitals and primary care facilities. The systems evaluated include both stand-alone tools and those integrated into electronic health records (EHR), featuring expert rule-based logic and new machine learning (ML) models. CDSS capabilities include prescribing guidance, alerts, resistance prediction, and de-escalation protocols. CDSS are intended to aid in antimicrobial prescribing by integrating clinical guidelines with data specific to each patient. Despite their theoretical potential, their effectiveness is often hindered by inconsistent incorporation into clinical practices, low user engagement, and inadequate design. Many systems are reactive, not well-suited to user needs, or lack transparency in their recommendations. Evaluating these systems is challenging due to varied outcomes, poor methodological quality of studies, and the complexity of attributing causality in intricate care settings. Barriers to implementation include alert fatigue, perceived time constraints, poor fit with existing workflows, and resistance to change. Instances like the COMPASS trial demonstrate the disconnect between design and practical application, underscoring the necessity for user-focused development, clear reasoning, and a balanced approach between mandatory and advisory elements. CDSS have the potential to improve antimicrobial use, but widespread impact is hindered by evaluation and implementation challenges. Realizing their value requires better integration, usability, and rigorous research frameworks tailored to complex healthcare settings.",

    "abstract": "Most antibiotics are prescribed, dispensed, and consumed in the community setting. Community pharmacists have a great potential to optimise antibiotic use and mitigate antibiotic resistance in this setting through antibiotic stewardship. This commentary aims to highlight critical areas where community pharmacists can contribute to optimising antibiotic use and to offer suggestions for how this can be implemented in practice. Currently, the role of the community pharmacist is mostly limited to dispensing of antibiotics and treatment of minor infectious ailments. This role needs to evolve to optimise antibiotic use and mitigate resistance development. Following the Social Care Framework for applying person-centred healthcare, there are five strategies through which the role of the community pharmacist can evolve: awareness, adjustment, assistance, alignment, and advocacy. Concretely, this could include many different activities such as better informing and counselling patients, optimising antibiotic treatment duration and choice, exact quantity dispensing, performing point-of-care tests, pharmacist prescribing of antibiotics, and joining academic detailing and public health campaigns. To achieve this, education, policy, and research need to be further aligned. In many countries, pharmacy education on antimicrobial stewardship needs a stronger basis in universities, followed by early career specialisation and continuous professional development. National and international policy changes are needed to recognise such specialisations and allow more advanced pharmacy services. Pharmacy research must be expanded and tailored to the community setting with innovative and practice-based designs. This will allow community pharmacists to fully embrace an enhanced position in antibiotic use and primary care.",

The practice also is not based on local guidelines and has no multidisciplinary approach in management. These factors likely contributed to higher rates of poor outcomes (more than one-fourth of the patients) when compared with similar studies in other countries. Therefore, these observations need the hospital's establishment of an antimicrobial stewardship program centered on fundamental strategies in pediatrics, including preauthorization, prospective audits with feedback, and pharmacist-led interventions that are feasible and accepted in the inpatient setting as soon as possible.",
