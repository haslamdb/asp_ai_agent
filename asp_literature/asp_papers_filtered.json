    "abstract": "Antibiotic overuse has been well-documented in all populations, including pediatrics. Pediatric pharmacists are valuable and well-integrated within inpatient antibiotic stewardship programs (ASP) in children's hospitals. The Pediatric Pharmacy Association (PPA) believes all pharmacists, regardless of practice setting, should receive education to support entry-level stewardship activities in pediatric patients. Additionally, pediatric antibiotic stewardship pharmacist leaders should ideally be trained in both infectious diseases (ID) and pediatrics. Currently, specialized training in pediatric ID lacks standardization due to the paucity of subspecialized training opportunities. This paper provides recommendations to support pediatric ASP training, education, and pharmacist staffing for inpatient programs. Further, it is recommended to ensure protected time is available for daily and longitudinal pediatric ASP activities to support optimal care and prevent burnout. Finally, the PPA supports the evolving role of the pediatric pharmacist in the ambulatory ASP arena and recommends investigations into unique payment modalities.",

    "abstract": "The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) developed the Core Antimicrobial Stewardship (AS) Curriculum to meet the increasing demand for infectious diseases (ID) providers with AS expertise. Notable diversity in implementation approaches has been observed among ID fellowship programs using the curriculum. We sought to describe individual approaches and develop a curriculum implementation roadmap. We surveyed ID fellowship programs that had previously implemented the IDSA Core AS curriculum. The survey included questions regarding program characteristics, curriculum participants and presentation format, resources and barriers, and implementation strategies. Commonly reported program features were summarized in the context of the self-reported implementation strategies. Implementation guides were developed based on the most common characteristics observed. Of 159 programs that had purchased the curriculum, 37 responded, and 34 (21%) were included in the analysis. The curriculum was primarily taught by AS physicians (85%) and AS pharmacists (47%). The most common conference structure was a longitudinal conference series (32%), and eLearning was the most common presentation format. Limited AS faculty time (76%) and limited first-year fellow availability (62%) were frequently reported as barriers, and dedicated AS curricular time was a resource available to most programs (67%); implementation guides were created for these 3 program features. Programs reported a variety of implementation barriers and resources, with several common themes emerging, allowing for the development of tailored curriculum planners for 3 commonly observed program characteristics. This work will equip fellowship programs with curriculum implementation strategies and guide future enhancements of the IDSA Core and Advanced AS curricula.",

    "journal": "Cureus",
    "abstract": "The emergency department (ED) is increasingly recognized as a critical site for antimicrobial stewardship, where most initial antibiotic decisions occur, and emergency physicians (EPs), previously regarded as primarily focused on empiric treatment, are now emerging as leaders. Policy milestones, including accreditation standards and national guidelines, have catalyzed this transition, yet physician roles remain heterogeneous, and evidence on long-term outcomes is limited. Drawing on English-language literature, including intervention studies, descriptive reports, and policy documents, this editorial highlights how EPs contribute through guideline development, audit and feedback, culture follow-up, formulary oversight, rapid diagnostics, and educational initiatives. Evidence consistently shows improvements in prescribing appropriateness, reduced use of broad-spectrum agents, and faster optimization without compromising safety. However, barriers such as time pressure, professional culture, role ambiguity, and limited resources remain persistent. Importantly, the leadership of EPs has proven central in overcoming these obstacles, especially when supported by institutional commitment and integrated workflows. Their engagement is not only improving immediate prescribing practices but also represents a critical frontline defense against antimicrobial resistance and multidrug-resistant organisms. Looking forward, formalizing physician leadership, embedding stewardship in emergency medicine training, and building ED-specific data systems are essential to sustain safe and effective antibiotic use.",

    "abstract": "Excessive use of postoperative prophylactic antibiotics in children's hospitals is a significant public health concern, leading to increased risks of infections like Clostridioides difficile, multidrug-resistant organisms, and unnecessary healthcare costs. Antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs) are designed to optimize antibiotic use, but ideal strategies for implementing evidence-based guidelines remain unclear. We tested facilitation, a dynamic process where trained individuals support healthcare personnel in bridging evidence-practice gaps, as a promising strategy for the de-implementation of unnecessary postoperative antibiotics in healthcare. The OPerAtiC trial employed a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled design across nine hospitals to compare the effectiveness of two ASP-led strategies, specifically order set changes to align with antibiotic guidelines (baseline arm) and facilitation training (intervention arm). Facilitation workshops were informed by the i-PARIHS framework, emphasizing context analysis, evidence application, and recipient engagement; and were conducted remotely. Data were collected from 2019 to 2024, involving interviews with stewardship team members every two months. Data collected included proximal implementation outcomes of each ASP team member (acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness), intermediate outcomes (facilitation skill use) reported by the ASP team, and order set change completion rates. Proximal implementation outcomes for both strategies were rated high across all study phases, indicating strong baseline enthusiasm among participants (N\u2009=\u200930). Key facilitation skills-effective communication, conflict resolution, and data presentation-were pivotal for successful implementation. Most order set changes (76%) were completed post-facilitation, targeting various specialties and achieving reductions or eliminations in antibiotic use. Facilitation was associated with significantly more completed order sets targeting antibiotic reduction (p\u2009=\u20090.01), suggesting a potential pathway to improve the appropriateness of antibiotic use through implementation strategies. Facilitation is a valuable approach in refining ASP efforts, contributing to the successful reduction and de-implementation of unnecessary antibiotic use in children's hospitals. The study underscores the need for ongoing training and support for ASP teams to enhance their effectiveness in promoting appropriate antibiotic-prescribing practices. Future research should explore the long-term impacts of facilitation on antibiotic stewardship and patient outcomes.

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) education plays a vital role in addressing antimicrobial resistance (AMR), yet its long-term impact on behavior and clinical outcomes remains underexplored. Educational interventions are often assessed through knowledge-based outcomes, with limited evaluation of sustained practice changes or patient-level results, and standardized higher-level outcome measures across diverse healthcare settings. This scoping review aimed to map pre-post AMS healthcare educational interventions using the Kirkpatrick Model, evaluating their effectiveness across its four levels: reaction, learning, behavior, and results. The goal was to identify trends, highlight gaps, and provide insight into reported outcomes, delivery methods, and evaluation tools, supporting future research and strengthening the evidence base for AMS education. This review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute framework. A literature search of nine databases identified studies from 2010 to 2024. Eligible studies included pre-post AMS educational interventions targeting undergraduate students and healthcare professionals (HCPs) and reporting outcomes which were subsequently mapped by the reviewers to the Kirkpatrick Model. Data were categorized by target population, delivery format, and evaluation tools. Narrative synthesis was used to describe trends and relationships. Studies targeted HCPs such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and dental professionals, and undergraduate students in pharmacy, medicine, nursing, and dentistry. Sixty-three studies were included. Outcomes were distributed across Level 1 (Reaction) (n\u2009=\u200946, 24%), Level 2 (Learning) (n\u2009=\u200951, 27%), Level 3 (Behavior) (n\u2009=\u200950, 26%), and Level 4 (Results) (n\u2009=\u200945, 23%). While n\u2009=\u200924 (38%) assessed all four levels, another n\u2009=\u200924 (38%) reported mixed or partial levels. Face-to-face or online-only formats achieved Levels 1 and 2. Whereas blended or workplace-integrated interventions more often demonstrated behavior change and clinical outcomes (Levels 3 and 4). Longitudinal follow-up and mixed evaluation tools (e.g., surveys, chart reviews, interviews) supported higher-level impacts. Pharmacy-led, interdisciplinary, and contextually tailored interventions mapped to all levels. AMS education often leads to short-term learning gains, but fewer interventions achieve sustained behavior change or measurable clinical outcomes. Blended and practice-integrated formats, paired with long-term evaluation, are key to realizing the full potential of AMS education. Embedding such approaches in undergraduate and professional programs can better prepare the future HCPs to address AMR effectively.",

A search for online education resources was carried out to identify UG curricula or CFs for HCPs for AMS or antimicrobial resistance applicable to the UK. Seven curricula or CFs were identified and reviewed. One AMS CF for all UG health workers, three for pharmacy UG students, one nursing AMS CF, one medical AMS CF, and the pathology curriculum. Domains varied between them but significant overlap was identified, and the majority of knowledge objectives in the WHO modules were covered in all UG curricula/CFs (except those objectives listed under the role of laboratory staff, which were only in the pathology curriculum). Gaps were identified between the most recently published UG curricula for pharmacists and the UKHSA antimicrobial prescribing and stewardship CF. There is significant correlation between the UG curricula/CFs for HCPs in the UK, the WHO curricula guide, and UKHSA antimicrobial prescribing and stewardship CF; however, there are some identified gaps.

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial Stewardship programs (ASPs) help reduce antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by promoting responsible antibiotic use. However, implementation is often inconsistent, especially in low-resource settings. Digital health technologies (DHTs) provide scalable and flexible means to enhance ASPs, particularly through targeted educational interventions for clinicians, students, and the public. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of digital educational within ASPs by enhancing knowledge and driving behavior change, with a specific focus on the educational strategies employed, their theoretical underpinnings, and their differential impact across populations and settings. This review followed PRISMA and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines, with a protocol registered in PROSPERO. A comprehensive search of four databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL) was conducted to identify primary peer-reviewed studies published in English that quantitatively evaluated digital educational ASPs. Risk of bias was assessed using standardized appraisal tools. Twenty-three studies, conducted in diverse contexts and targeting different stakeholders, were included in the review. All interventions reported positive impacts on knowledge enhancement and behavior change. Engagement-driven approaches, such as interactive modules, real-time feedback, and case-based simulations, were most common, and strategies were tailored to the specific target groups. However, theoretical underpinnings were rarely reported, with only two studies explicitly grounded in behavior change theory. Few studies included long-term follow-up assessments, and most lacked rigorous designs such as randomization. Risk of bias was assessed and varied across studies. The interventions varied widely in duration, frequency, and delivery format, limiting comparability. Digital educational ASPs show strong promise in improving knowledge and driving behavior change across a wide range of settings and stakeholder groups. Their adaptability, scalability, and user-centered design underscore their potential as valuable tools in the global effort to combat antimicrobial resistance. To maximize their long-term impact, future interventions should be informed by behavioral theory, include follow-up beyond six months, and address contextual needs in low-resource settings.",

    "abstract": "Excessive use of postoperative prophylactic antibiotics in children's hospitals is a significant public health concern, leading to increased risks of infections like  The OPerAtiC trial employed a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled design across nine hospitals to compare the effectiveness of two ASP-led strategies, specifically order set changes to align with antibiotic guidelines (baseline arm) and facilitation training (intervention arm). Facilitation workshops were informed by the i-PARIHS framework, emphasizing context analysis, evidence application, and recipient engagement; and were conducted remotely. Data were collected from 2019 to 2024, involving interviews with stewardship team members every two months. Data collected included proximal implementation outcomes of each ASP team member (acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness), intermediate outcomes (facilitation skill use) reported by the ASP team, and order set change completion rates. Proximal implementation outcomes for both strategies were rated high across all study phases, indicating strong baseline enthusiasm among participants (N = 30). Key facilitation skills-effective communication, conflict resolution, and data presentation-were pivotal for successful implementation. Most order set changes (76%) were completed post-facilitation, targeting various specialties and achieving reductions or eliminations in antibiotic use. Facilitation was associated with significantly more completed order sets targeting antibiotic reduction (p = 0.01), thereby increasing the appropriateness of antibiotic use. Facilitation is a valuable approach in refining ASP efforts, contributing to the successful reduction and de-implementation of unnecessary antibiotic use in children's hospitals. The study underscores the need for ongoing training and support for ASP teams to enhance their effectiveness in promoting appropriate antibiotic-prescribing practices. Future research should explore the long-term impacts of facilitation on antibiotic stewardship and patient outcomes.

    "abstract": "The rise of antimicrobial resistance as leading infection-related cause of death will necessitate trans-sectoral efforts on a global level. While many antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) incentives target healthcare workers, addressing undergraduates offers new and hitherto neglected opportunities. We describe the pilot phase of a novel undergraduate elective (\"stewards for future\", SFF) for medical students at the Saarland University, Germany, between 2021 and 2023. We focused on knowledge and attitudes relevant to AMS. To allow for full immersion, we applied case-based learning, problem-based learning, and peer teaching in a small group teaching format spanning 15 hours, including AMS ward rounds. We obtained students' pre- and post-course self-assessment regarding AMS topics using 5-point Likert scales modified from the previously published ASSURE elective, as well as their subjective experience using the German short intrinsic motivation inventory. Over four terms, 23 undergraduate medical students from the clinical phase participated in the elective. Participants reported an increase in their ability to explain the concept of AMS (mean and standard deviation, pre 3.26\u00b10.94 vs. post 4.74\u00b10.44, p<0.0001), their confidence in choosing the appropriate antibiotic (pre 2.22\u00b10.78 vs. post 3.57\u00b10.58, p<0.0001), their ability to judge potential drug side effects (pre 2.09\u00b10.72 vs. post 3.43\u00b10.71, p<0.0001), their confidence in communicating with colleagues about antibiotics (pre 2.30\u00b10.86 vs. post 3.52\u00b10.83, p<0.0001), their understanding of diagnostics as an AMS tool (pre 4.22\u00b10.41 vs. post 4.91\u00b10.28, p<0.0001), and their ability to evaluate the roles of all AMS team members including their own (pre 2.52\u00b10.77 vs. post 4.13\u00b10.68, p<0.0001). Participants reported having enjoyed the course (4.6\u00b10.5), while they were moderately satisfied with their performance (3.8\u00b11.0). Pressure and anxiety levels were reported to be low (1.8\u00b10.9 and 2.0\u00b11.0 each). Student participants of the elective SFF reported increased competencies relevant to AMS, while enjoying the course format. Sustainability and scalability will ultimately depend on the implementation into the core curriculum. Antibiotikaresistenzen und damit einhergehende Infektionen sind mit einer sehr hohen Krankheits- und Sterblichkeitslast assoziiert und erfordern einen sektoren\u00fcbergreifenden, global ansetzenden Umgang. W\u00e4hrend in den letzten Jahren zahlreiche Antibiotic Stewardship (ABS) Ma\u00dfnahmen, beispielsweise als Kurse f\u00fcr \u00c4rzt:innen, initiiert wurden, sind Studierende bislang als Adressaten unterrepr\u00e4sentiert. In diesem Pilotprojekt wird die Konzeption und Einf\u00fchrung eines neuen Wahlpflichtfaches (\u201eStewards for Future\u201c, SFF) f\u00fcr Studierende an der Medizinischen Fakult\u00e4t der Universit\u00e4t des Saarlandes im Zeitraum 2021 bis 2023 beschrieben. Der Fokus des Lehrformates lag auf der Vermittlung ABS-relevanter Kompetenzen, bezogen auf Wissen und Haltung. Die dabei eingesetzten Lehrmethoden waren Fall-basiertes und Problem-orientiertes Lernen, Peer Teaching in Kleingruppen, sowie Visiten am Patientenbett. Das Wahlpflichtfach umfasste 15 Stunden. Zu Beginn und nach Abschluss des Wahlpflichtfaches erfolgte eine ABS-Themen bezogene Selbsteinsch\u00e4tzung mittels 5-Punkt-Likert-Skalen auf der Basis eines zuvor publizierten Fragebogens. Zudem wurde nach Abschluss das subjektive Erleben anhand des deutschsprachigen Kurzfragbogens zur intrinsischen Motivation erhoben. \u00dcber einen Zeitraum von vier Semestern nahmen insgesamt 23 Medizinstudierende des klinischen Abschnitts am Wahlpflichtfach teil. In der Selbsteinsch\u00e4tzung durch die Teilnehmenden konnte eine Zunahme von zu Beginn (vorher) bis nach Abschluss (nachher) des Wahlfachs f\u00fcr folgende Angaben festgestellt werden: ihre F\u00e4higkeit, die Grundlagen und Bedeutung von ABS zu erkl\u00e4ren (Mittelwert und Standardabweichung vorher 3,26\u00b10,94 vs. nachher 4,74\u00b10,44, p<0,0001); die Sicherheit in der Auswahl von Antibiotika (vorher 2,22\u00b10,78 vs. nachher 3,57\u00b10,58, p<0,0001); ihre F\u00e4higkeit, das Nebenwirkungspotential von spezifischen Antibiotika zu bewerten und in ihre Auswahl einflie\u00dfen zu lassen (vorher 2,09\u00b10,72 vs. nachher 3,43\u00b10,71, p<0,0001), ihre Sicherheit in der Kommunikation mit Kolleg:innen bez\u00fcglich Antibiotika (vorher 2,30\u00b10,86 vs. nachher 3,52\u00b10,83, p<0,0001), das Verst\u00e4ndnis der Bedeutung der Infektionsdiagnostik f\u00fcr den rationalen Einsatz von Antibiotika (vorher 4,22\u00b10,41 vs. nachher 4,91\u00b10,28, p<0,0001), und die F\u00e4higkeit, ihre Rolle als Steward im interprofessionellen Team einzuordnen und die Rollen der Anderen im Team zu kennen (vorher 2,52\u00b10,77 vs. nachher 4,13\u00b10,68, p<0,0001). Die Teilnehmenden gaben an, dass ihnen der Kurs Spa\u00df gemacht h\u00e4tte (4,6\u00b10,5), wobei sie moderat zufrieden mit ihrer eigenen Leistung waren (3,8\u00b11,0). Das Gef\u00fchl unter Druck oder angespannt zu sein, wurden als niedrig eingesch\u00e4tzt (1,8\u00b10,9 und 2,0\u00b11,0). Die Teilnehmenden des Wahlpflichtfachs SFF berichteten von angestiegenen Kompetenzen, die f\u00fcr ABS relevant sind, und hatten zugleich Spa\u00df am Lehrformat.

    "abstract": "There is a need for improved antimicrobial stewardship on dairy farms, and changes will be largely enacted by the farm workers who are responsible for carrying out farm procedures. For this reason, efforts directed at educating and enabling farm workers in antimicrobial stewardship are necessary for compliance with farm-level antimicrobial usage policies. Therefore, the objectives of this research were (1) to determine the competencies needed by dairy farm workers to implement antimicrobial stewardship and to inform educational resource development and (2) explore the farm contexts that influence farm worker antimicrobial stewardship capabilities. Initially, focus group discussions were conducted in person with 6 groups of veterinarians at 3 independent conferences held in the United States. To gain additional perspectives, 2 focus groups were conducted via video link with dairy producers from the midwestern United States. The focus groups had 4 to 8 participants and 2 to 4 facilitators each, and were audio recorded and transcribed for analysis. Discussions were audio recorded, transcribed, and evaluated using inductive thematic analysis, with 9 key themes identified. Participants emphasized that farm workers needed to be willing to learn, to be responsible, and to be consistent in their execution of tasks. Furthermore, farm workers needed knowledge about the rationale behind antimicrobial use strategies and disease mitigation practices. General skills needed by farm workers included good communication, excellent observation, and the ability to follow protocols and keep records. Technical skills required by farm workers related to the handling of animals, attention to cleanliness, ability to properly administer pharmaceutical products, and farm equipment maintenance. The skills and knowledge required differed among farm workers depending on their responsibilities and experience, with greater expectations for herd managers compared with employees who specialized in a specific task such as milking. Farm contexts that affected antimicrobial stewardship included the farm size, which had an impact on the 3 other themes: workplace culture, leadership, and tools. Workplace culture encompassed having an approachable environment and clear responsibilities, and leadership encompassed managerial capacity and veterinary support. Important tools for effective antimicrobial stewardship included relevant and up-to-date protocols, technology, equipment, and a proficient workforce. The evidence provided through these focus groups is useful for informing competency-based educational efforts aimed at improving antimicrobial stewardship on dairy farms.",

    "abstract": "Small animal antimicrobial stewardship (AS) is emerging as a priority area in the global battle against antimicrobial resistance. Veterinary practices have limited support for implementation of AS programs, and even within veterinary schools, efforts are largely siloed and often limited in scope. Increased collaboration is needed to support and unify AS and infection prevention and control efforts, and to identify priorities for continued research. To address this, a 2-day in-person small animal AS workshop was held in August 2023. Delegates representing 23 US veterinary schools and 4 corporations/government agencies gathered for a series of lightning talks and focused group discussions in 3 domains: implementation of clinical AS programs, research opportunities and needs, and education. The workshop's goal was to identify and propose solutions for AS challenges. Meeting discussion identified a lack of resources and training as the greatest barriers to hospital AS program advancement and suggested creating standards for AS programs and a road map to support program development. Assessing antimicrobial treatment effects and performing studies to establish necessary treatment durations were considered the highest research priorities. Integrated educational practices were recommended to support unified messaging of AS concepts between preclinical and clinical training. The development of strategies to implement these suggestions was delegated to working groups with a goal to continue meeting biennially as a large group. Sharing news of these efforts is considered integral to heightening awareness and promoting implementation of AS practices moving forward in academic, specialty, and primary care settings.",

    "journal": "Cureus",
    "abstract": "Introduction Antibiotic stewardship is becoming critically important as resistant bacteria become increasingly prevalent. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as a major global health challenge, driven in part by the misuse and overuse of antibiotics. An acute sore throat is one of the most frequent reasons for patients to seek medical care, yet only a minority of cases require antibiotic treatment. Despite this, inappropriate prescribing is rife, often influenced by diagnostic uncertainty, patient expectations, and non-clinical pressures. These challenges highlight the importance of reinforcing evidence-based strategies, such as the use of Centor criteria, to support accurate assessment and reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing in patients presenting with a sore throat. This quality improvement project evaluated adherence to Centor criteria and subsequent antibiotic prescribing in an accident and emergency (A&E) department in the Northwest of England, before and after clinician education on NICE guidance and documentation of Centor criteria. Materials and methods One hundred patients presenting with an acute sore throat between January and March 2023 were identified. Electronic patient data were collected retrospectively to analyze the documentation's adherence to NICE guidelines and Modified Centor criteria. Results Pre-intervention, 16% of clinicians documented all Centor criteria, 48% incorrectly prescribed antibiotics, and only 20% prescribed appropriate antibiotics. Through post-intervention teaching and literature dissemination, the figures changed to 54%, 22%, and 56%, respectively. Conclusion Targeted clinician education and adherence to NICE guidelines improved antibiotic prescribing for the acute sore throat, underscoring the value of audit cycles while highlighting the need for sustained, larger-scale efforts to reduce AMR.",

    "abstract": "Dentists are responsible for 10% of all antibiotic prescriptions. It is estimated that, in certain situations, up to 80% of antibiotic prescriptions in dentistry may be inappropriate. The aim of this study was to explore Spanish dentists' attitudes, perceptions, and contextual factors influencing antibiotic use and misuse in clinical practice. From July to December 2022, we conducted focus groups with 31 dentists from Spain Data were analysed using thematic analysis with a pragmatic orientation to address the research objectives. Inclusion criteria required participants to be dentistry graduates or oral medicine specialists (stomatologists) and actively working as dentists. The sample was selected through key informants and the snowball method. We ensured methodological quality by adhering to the COREQ checklist. We formed seven synchronous online focus groups with 31 participants. Dentists acknowledged the problem of antibiotic resistance, identifying fear, working conditions and burnout and patient trust as factors contributing to inappropriate prescribing. Despite this awareness, dentists did not see themselves as key agents of change in combating antibiotic resistance. However, they expressed interest in further education on the topic. These findings underscore the need for educational interventions that highlight dentists' role in antimicrobial stewardship. By situating these interventions within the One Health framework, dentists can be empowered to translate their leadership in oral health into active participation in the prudent use of antibiotics. Strengthening this role has practical implications for multidisciplinary strategies to combat antimicrobial resistance.",

The American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Urgent Care Medicine and Pediatric Acute and Critical Care Quality Network developed a multicenter quality improvement collaborative. We used national guidelines to determine criteria for nonsevere AOM and first-line antibiotics for AOM and pharyngitis. Participating UCCs committed at least 3 clinicians to submit 10 encounters for each diagnosis per month during the intervention period (October 2022 to June 2023). Clinicians signed commitment letters, participated in monthly learning sessions, and tested UCC-selected interventions. We recruited 84 participants from 13 UCCs. Participants submitted 5017 AOM encounters and 3762 pharyngitis encounters. The use of first-line antibiotics for AOM and GAS pharyngitis remained stable at 75.7% and 79.9%, respectively, throughout the project. The documentation of delayed antibiotic criteria increased from a range of 26%-27% at baseline to 83% [5.42% per month (95% CI: 4.03-6.81)]. This corresponded to an increase in use of delayed antibiotics for AOM from a range of 32%-42% at baseline to 70% by the end of the intervention period [2.53% per month (95% CI: 0.57-4.48)]. Rates of GAS testing before treating pharyngitis increased during baseline and remained high (>96%) throughout the intervention period. This multicenter collaborative provided education and networking to increase the use of delayed antibiotics for AOM in pediatric UCCs.",

Forty-nine general practices in the South of England each hosted a 1\u2005h in-house workshop, facilitated by trained local pharmacy professionals. This type of educational outreach approach using TARGET (Target Antibiotics Responsibly, Guidance, Education and Tools) antibiotic materials has previously been shown to reduce antibiotic dispensing in a UK primary care setting. The workshop included a review of antibiotic prescribing data, a presentation on paediatric AMS showcasing locally agreed paediatric prescribing guidelines and safety-netting resources from the Healthier Together website, and formulation of a local action plan. The primary outcome measure was total oral antibiotic prescriptions ('items') dispensed per 1000 patients aged under 5\u2005years for the year after the workshop, compared with the previous year's dispensing. The median prescribing rate for children under 5\u2005years of age changed from a baseline of 48.9 per 1000 patients prior to the intervention to a new median monthly prescribing rate of 39.0 per 1000 patients following the intervention. There was no increase in paediatric presentations to primary care following the intervention. This low-cost intervention has the potential to reduce primary care antibiotic prescribing in children and we did not detect an increase in GP attendance rates after this intervention in our study.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in microbiome research have highlighted the oral cavity as a complex and dynamic ecosystem, home to over 700 microbial species that play critical roles in both oral and systemic health. The oral microbiota not only maintains local tissue homeostasis but also serves as a reservoir for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, contributing to the global spread of resistance. Frequent and sometimes inappropriate antibiotic use in dental practice, along with exposure to antiseptics and biocides, drives the emergence and horizontal transfer of resistance determinants within oral biofilms. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms and ecological drivers of AMR in the oral microbiome, emphasizing the clinical implications of dysbiosis and drug-resistant infections. The authors advocate for the development of dental clinical guidelines tailored to the unique characteristics of the oral microbiota, focusing on personalized therapy through molecular diagnostics, standardized AMR risk assessment, and the integration of non-antibiotic strategies such as probiotics and photodynamic therapy. Continuous education in antimicrobial stewardship and the implementation of oral-specific AMR surveillance is also highlighted as an essential component of effective resistance management. To support rational prescribing, a dedicated mobile application has been developed, leveraging microbiota data and resistance profiles to guide evidence-based, targeted therapy and reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. Collectively, these strategies aim to preserve antibiotic efficacy, ensure patient safety, and promote sustainable infection management in the dental field.",

A mixed-methods approach was used, which included attendance data collection, facility-level assessments, post-session and follow-up surveys, as well as focus group discussions. Between September 2023 and February 2025, 77 virtual learning sessions were conducted, engaging 2445 unique participants from hospital-based AMS committees and health professionals across the three countries. Participants reported significant knowledge gain, and data showed facility improvements in two core AMS areas, including the implementation of multidisciplinary ward-based interventions/communications and enhanced monitoring of antibiotic resistance patterns. Along those lines, participants reported that the program assisted them in improving prescribing and culture-based treatments, and also evidence-informed antibiotic selection. The evidence of implementing ward-based interventions was further stressed in focus group discussions, as well as other strengthened practices like point-prevalence surveys, and development or revision of stewardship policies. Substantial improvements in microbiology services were also shared by participants, particularly in Malawi. Other practices mentioned were strengthened multidisciplinary communication, infection prevention efforts, and education of patients and the community. Our findings suggest that a virtual case-based learning educational intervention, providing structured and tailored AMS capacity building, can drive behavior change and strengthen healthcare systems in low resource settings. Future efforts should aim to scale up the engagements and sustain improvements to further strengthen AMS capacity.",

Evaluation of the quantity and appropriateness of common antifungal prescriptions like fluconazole is essential in the development of these programmes. To perform a clinical audit of fluconazole prescribing and explore whether involvement of pharmacy students in this process was feasible and meaningful from both pharmacy student and health system perspectives. An audit was conducted of all fluconazole prescriptions from January 2024 to March 2024 at two Sydney hospitals. Trained pharmacy students, under the supervision of antimicrobial stewardship pharmacists and physicians, completed the audit using the Antifungal National Antimicrobial Prescribing Survey audit tool. Prescriptions were assessed for their compliance to guidelines and appropriateness. Data on pharmacy students' educational experience was collected by a 5-point Likert scale survey. A total of 145 fluconazole prescriptions were audited: 34 for empiric therapy, 56 for directed therapy, and 56 for prophylaxis. A total of 91 (62.8%) prescriptions were assessed as appropriate, 46 (31.7%) were inappropriate, and 8 (5.5%) were not assessable. Potential drug-drug interactions were identified in 17 patients receiving fluconazole doses of 200\u00a0mg or greater, of which three were clinically significant, requiring intervention. Students had positive experiences contributing to quality use of medicines, in terms of enjoyment, support, and education. Inappropriate fluconazole use was common. Pharmacy students made a positive contribution to the antifungal audit, promoting good stewardship practises for the hospital while accessing enhanced learning and development opportunities. A multisite clinical audit of 145 fluconazole prescriptions found 62.8% were appropriate, 31.7% inappropriate. Pharmacy students played a vital role in the audit by identifying drug interactions and gaining valuable learning experiences. Their involvement supported antifungal stewardship efforts.",

Enhancing professionals' communication skills is one of the most promising interventions for optimising antibiotic prescription in respiratory tract infections in children. We developed a communication skills course for primary care paediatricians, paediatric nurses and community pharmacists. We conducted: 1) A scoping review, 2) brainstorming and selection of themes, 3) design of content, 4) user testing, through a survey and semi-structured interviews. A multidisciplinary advisory group gave feedback throughout the design and development process. We conducted a descriptive analysis of the survey results, and we used a predefined analytical framework for qualitative content. The course comprised four modules with nineteen themes, which included communication theoretical content, clinical cases, complementary reading, videos, and a glossary. It also included a forum and webinars, after each module. Sixteen users completed several themes and a survey, and eight were interviewed. They rated a mean of 4 or higher (5-point scale), across most of the domains evaluated. The videos received the highest rating (4.81; SD\u2009=\u20090.39). Suggestions for improvement included incorporating a workshop, and featuring more representation of other professionals. The majority of professionals (93%) expressed interest in completing the course. We developed a comprehensive, evidence-based online communication skills training course to optimise antibiotic prescribing in paediatric primary care. Integrating key communication strategies and insights from a scoping review, the course equips healthcare professionals with practical tools to enhance shared decision-making and antimicrobial stewardship.

    "abstract": "To highlight the unintended consequences of microbiological test results in driving inappropriate antimicrobial prescriptions, and to evaluate strategies - particularly from the perspective of diagnostic stewardship - that may mitigate this issue. Despite the critical role of microbiological data in guiding appropriate antimicrobial therapy, several studies have demonstrated that misinterpretation of such results frequently leads to unnecessary treatments. Common pitfalls include overinterpretation of positive cultures from poorly collected or clinically unwarranted samples, misclassification of colonization vs. infection, and excessive reliance on test results in the absence of supporting clinical evidence. Emerging diagnostic stewardship interventions - ranging from restricting sample processing and modifying test reporting to implementing decision support tools - have shown promising outcomes in reducing overtreatment without compromising patient safety. Specific examples include urine and wound cultures, respiratory specimens, and the diagnosis of Clostridioides difficile infection. Furthermore, educational and system-level strategies such as the BLADDER score or selective result reporting can improve decision-making at various stages of the diagnostic process. Microbiology laboratories play a pivotal role in antimicrobial stewardship and must actively support clinicians in avoiding diagnostic and therapeutic errors. While evidence supports multiple approaches to mitigate inappropriate prescriptions driven by microbiology results, their successful implementation requires interdisciplinary collaboration, tailored interventions, and ongoing evaluation of clinical impact. Diagnostic stewardship, when aligned with clinician education and robust reporting practices, is a crucial component in enhancing the accuracy of infection diagnosis and reducing antimicrobial overuse.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is a worldwide problem caused by the inappropriate use of antibiotics. In Australia, antibiotics are frequently prescribed in general practice (primary care) settings for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) despite these infections most commonly being caused by viruses. The Optimal Implementation of Antimicrobial Stewardship in General Practice (OptimasGP) study aims to provide implementation support for effective antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) interventions for ARIs. The current study will examine if a redesigned workflow, and an AMS Toolbox containing AMS resources, is an acceptable way to access AMS interventions and clinical data collected in general practice settings. A mixed-methods approach will be applied using a single-arm, pragmatic exploratory study. Data will be collected for a period of 3\u00a0months. Data collection from general practice settings in New South Wales, Australia, will involve the participation of 4 to 6 practices, 12 general practitioners (GPs), and 6 to 8 practice staff. We also aim to recruit 50-100 patients to complete surveys and 12 patients to participate in focus group discussions. Participating GPs and practice staff will be provided with an online AMS Toolbox to facilitate access to AMS resources. Two hours of online training and a reminder card will also be provided. The AMS Toolbox will contain AMS resources for shared decision-making, clinical decision support (including point-of-care testing), and delayed antibiotic prescribing in patients with ARIs. The primary outcome of the study will be the acceptability of the AMS Toolbox to GPs, practice staff, and patients. Secondary outcomes will include recruitment and completion rates, qualitative findings from the focus group discussions, resource use and antibiotic prescription rates, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), and patient-reported experience measures (PREMS). AMS interventions are needed to help reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for ARIs in general practice settings. The findings of this study will inform a hybrid type 3 implementation trial.

A key driver of antimicrobial resistance is the inappropriate and excessive use of antibiotics, which accelerates the development of resistant strains. At the same time, the lack of new antibiotics in development exacerbates the crisis.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate antibiotic prescription knowledge and practices among Oman Medical Specialty Board (OMSB) paediatric residents. The goal was to identify educational opportunities to reduce antimicrobial resistance and improve patient care. A survey-based cross-sectional study was conducted among the OMSB paediatric residents from August 2023 to September 2023. The online survey involved three parts: residents' demographics, knowledge of 12 common paediatric infection scenarios and clinical practice. Participants were asked to choose the proper antibiotic choices and duration for each scenario. Data analysis was performed using SPSS. A total of 74 responses were obtained, resulting in an 84% response rate. No significant differences were observed in the knowledge of antibiotic prescriptions among paediatric residents at different stages of their residency. The highest knowledge-based adherence rate to local antibiotic guidelines was noted in the acute sinusitis scenario (n = 70; 94.6%), followed by the acute meningitis scenario (n = 68; 91.9%). Conversely, the lowest adherence was observed in the acute otitis media (n = 16; 21.6%), followed by cellulitis (n = 23; 31.1%). Residents exhibited proficient clinical judgement by consulting infectious disease specialists when required based on the scenarios provided. The low knowledge-based adherence to antibiotic guidelines for common paediatric infections, coupled with the lack of significant differences in antibiotic knowledge between senior and junior paediatric residents, underscores the need for collective educational interventions. These interventions aim to advance knowledge and skills in antimicrobial stewardship and local antibiotic guidelines application.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial stewardship is a collaborative intervention strategy aimed at promoting the selection of optimal antimicrobial regimens to improve and measure the appropriate use of antimicrobials, thereby fostering rational use of these agents, enhancing patient outcomes effectively, and curbing the wide dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. Recently, nurses' pivotal contribution in multidisciplinary antimicrobial stewardship teams is increasingly recognized. However, the contexts and mechanisms able to facilitate nurses' participation in the complex dynamics of antimicrobial stewardship remain unclear. This review aims to identify and analyze the mechanisms, contextual factors, and outcomes that promote nurses' participation in antimicrobial stewardship interventions. This study adheres to the methods of realist review based on the Normalization Process Theory. Preliminary programme theories were generated through an extensive literature review and thematic analysis. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, CNKI, and Wangfang databases. The final Context-Mechanism-Outcome configurations were determined to validate the final programme theory. A total of 5635 articles were retrieved; ultimately, 35 studies were included for a comprehensive analysis. The review identified five key configurations clarifying the interactions among contextual factors, mechanisms, and outcomes: (1) Contextual factors: multidisciplinary team collaboration and hospital organizational support. (2) Strategies and mechanisms: articulating nurses' contributions and impact (Coherence-Building), promoting awareness and positive perceptions (Cognitive Participation), enhancing nurses' competencies (Collective Action), fostering collaborative and motivating frameworks, and emphasizing continuous quality improvement (Reflexive Monitoring). (3) Outcomes: improvements in patient outcomes (e.g., faster antibiotic initiation, shorter hospital stays, and lower mortality) and staff outcomes (e.g., enhanced knowledge, confidence, and adherence to antimicrobial stewardship practices). This realist review has developed a theoretical framework to promote nurses' participation in antimicrobial stewardship practices. This framework emphasizes the complex dynamic mechanisms that facilitate or hinder nurses' involvement in antimicrobial stewardship and aims to implement evidence-based strategies to encourage nurses' participation in antimicrobial stewardship practices. This, in turn, is expected to enhance the effectiveness of hospital antimicrobial stewardship initiatives and improve the quality of patient care within the hospital environment. This realist review highlights that, at both individual and organizational levels, supporting nurses' professional roles and responsibilities through targeted education, expanded prescribing authority, collaborative frameworks, and continuous quality improvement empowers nurses to integrate antimicrobial stewardship into their daily practice. By delineating the relevant mechanisms, contextual factors, and outcomes, the findings inform the design of complex interventions to sustain nurses' engagement in hospital antimicrobial stewardship programs, and advance the evolution of advanced nursing practice.",

As antibiotic administration involves care coordination and the participation of different team members, education and the antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) program play a key role in reducing these times. This study evaluated the time between the initial prescription and the effective administration of antibiotics for ICU patients in seven Latin American hospitals, before (pre-) and after (post-I and post-II) the implementation of a tailored educational approach. After establishing a baseline measurement (pre-), we implemented a tailored educational intervention directed to the ICU team including nurses, specialists, pharmacists, and the members of the AMS team. Then, we conducted a post-intervention measurement after a 3 month period (post-I) and repeated it after a 1 year period (post-II). During the pre-interventional phase, the hang time varied between 88 and 178 min, reporting an adherence to the 1 hour bundle of 33.8%. For the post-I, it significantly reduced with time variations between 46 and 104 min, showing an increase of 54.9% in adherence. After 1 year, in post-II, a persistent effect of shorter administration time was observed, varying between 49 and 109 min, increasing the adherence to 59.6%. Our results highlight that an active and tailored multidisciplinary AMS educational process incorporating antibiotic hang time protocols and including multidisciplinary healthcare teams involved in coordinating sepsis care decreases the administration time of antibiotics in Latin American hospitals with limited resources.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes aim to enhance antibiotic prescription quality, reduce antibiotic use, and combat multi-drug-resistant pathogens. However, the optimal AMS intervention for different clinical settings remains unclear, with previous studies predominantly focusing on antibiotic consumption rather than prescription appropriateness. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of an education-based AMS intervention on antibiotic prescription appropriateness in three medical units of a 1500-bed university hospital. We conducted a retrospective interventional, interrupted time series study, to test the effect of an educational programme in three medical units of our 1500-bed university hospital in Rome, from June 2018 to October 2019. The intervention comprised six educational meetings held over 3 months (December 2018 to February 2019). The primary outcome was the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions, with in-hospital survival as a secondary outcome. Of 609 antibiotic prescriptions evaluated, the programme led to a significant and sustained reduction in inappropriate prescriptions in one unit (change in level: -18.15%, P<0.01; change in trend: -3.21%, P=0.01), while it failed to demonstrate a significant reduction in the other two units and globally in the three units. The same educational AMS programme led to variable results in terms of antibiotic appropriateness in three medical units with similar structural and organizational features. Larger and more tailored high-quality AMS interventional studies are needed to better understand the impact of educational programmes on the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions.",

    "abstract": "In some emergency departments (EDs), pharmacists review and follow-up on microbiological test results for recently discharged patients, intervening when empiric therapy is missing or inadequate to ensure appropriate antimicrobial use. Currently, this practice is not well described in Canada. Characterizing these ED pharmacist activities can help identify antimicrobial stewardship opportunities and allow for more tailored education and training. The primary objective of this study was to describe culture review and follow-up pharmacy practice in terms of antimicrobial stewardship interventions. Secondary objectives included describing the types of cultures being managed and the antimicrobials prescribed empirically and post-culture review. A retrospective chart review was conducted using pharmacist workload tracking documentation to identify patients with eligible cultures from six EDs in Alberta. Three hundred cultures were included in this study, and one hundred twenty-nine interventions (40.7% of all cultures reviewed) were performed by ED pharmacists. Initiation of therapy was the most common (33.3%), followed by tailoring therapy (21.7%). Urine cultures were predominant (55.7%), and the antibiotics most prescribed, empirically, and post-culture for urine, were cefixime (44%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (34%), respectively. Five patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria were treated with antibiotics. Five patients with skin and soft tissue infections were treated with dual oral antibiotics when culture and sensitivity results indicated monotherapy would have been sufficient. Eight extra days of cefixime therapy were prescribed due to unaccounted doses administered in the ED. This study highlights the critical role of ED pharmacists in culture review and follow-up activities and their contributions to antimicrobial stewardship. By characterizing culture review and follow-up practices, several opportunities for minimizing unnecessary antimicrobial use were identified. These findings will help inform the development of targeted education and training programs to help strengthen the stewardship capabilities of ED pharmacists and prescribers. R\u00e9SUM\u00e9: CONTEXTE: Dans certains services d\u2019urgence (SU), les pharmaciens examinent et suivent les r\u00e9sultats des tests microbiologiques pour les patients r\u00e9cemment lib\u00e9r\u00e9s, intervenant lorsque la th\u00e9rapie empirique est absente ou insuffisante pour assurer une utilisation appropri\u00e9e des antimicrobiens. Actuellement, cette pratique n\u2019est pas bien d\u00e9crite au Canada. La caract\u00e9risation de ces activit\u00e9s des pharmaciens en DE peut aider \u00e0 cerner les possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019intendance antimicrobienne et permettre une \u00e9ducation et une formation plus adapt\u00e9es. OBJECTIF: L\u2019objectif principal de cette \u00e9tude \u00e9tait de d\u00e9crire la pratique d\u2019examen des cultures et de suivi en pharmacie en termes d\u2019interventions de g\u00e9rance antimicrobienne. Les objectifs secondaires comprenaient la description des types de cultures \u00e0 g\u00e9rer et des antimicrobiens prescrits par l\u2019examen empirique et post-culture. M\u00e9THODES: Un examen r\u00e9trospectif des dossiers a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019aide de la documentation de suivi de la charge de travail du pharmacien afin d\u2019identifier les patients ayant des cultures admissibles provenant de six DE en Alberta. R\u00e9SULTATS: Trois cents cultures ont \u00e9t\u00e9 incluses dans cette \u00e9tude, et cent vingt-neuf interventions (40,7 % de toutes les cultures examin\u00e9es) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es par des pharmaciens ED. L\u2019initiation de la th\u00e9rapie \u00e9tait la plus fr\u00e9quente (33,3 %), suivie par l\u2019adaptation de la th\u00e9rapie (21,7 %). Les cultures urinaires \u00e9taient pr\u00e9dominantes (55,7 %), et les antibiotiques les plus prescrits, empiriquement et postculture pour l\u2019urine, \u00e9taient la c\u00e9fixime (44 %) et le trim\u00e9thoprime-sulfam\u00e9thoxazole (34 %), respectivement. Cinq patients pr\u00e9sentant une bact\u00e9riurie asymptomatique ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s par des antibiotiques. Cinq patients atteints d\u2019infections de la peau et des tissus mous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s avec deux antibiotiques oraux lorsque les r\u00e9sultats de culture et de sensibilit\u00e9 indiquaient que la monoth\u00e9rapie aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisante. Huit jours suppl\u00e9mentaires de c\u00e9fixime ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prescrits en raison de doses non comptabilis\u00e9es administr\u00e9es dans l\u2019ED. CONCLUSION: Cette \u00e9tude met en \u00e9vidence le r\u00f4le essentiel des pharmaciens de la DE dans les activit\u00e9s d\u2019examen et de suivi des cultures, ainsi que leur contribution \u00e0 l\u2019intendance des antimicrobiens. En caract\u00e9risant les pratiques d\u2019examen et de suivi des cultures, plusieurs possibilit\u00e9s de r\u00e9duire au minimum l\u2019utilisation inutile d\u2019antimicrobiens ont \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9es. Ces constatations aideront \u00e0 orienter l\u2019\u00e9laboration de programmes cibl\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9ducation et de formation pour aider \u00e0 renforcer les capacit\u00e9s d\u2019intendance des pharmaciens et des prescripteurs en DE.",

    "abstract": "Prescribing medication\u00a0is an essential part of clinical dentistry, particularly concerning the use of antibiotics for acute odontogenic infections, surgical prophylaxis, and care of medically compromised patients. Research on dental students' knowledge and perception of antimicrobial prophylaxis in dental practice is notably lacking in Nepal. This study aims to bridge that gap by assessing the level of understanding among Nepali dental students. An online, questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was carried out among dental students all over Nepal. A total of 288 dental students from Nepal took part in the study, comprising 189 undergraduate students, 62 interns, and 37 postgraduate students. A standard structured questionnaire that included 12 clinically relevant and three perception-based questions was distributed online. The results were analyzed via descriptive statistics. The mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD correct answers were 6.79\u2009\u00b1\u20092.26. More than three-fourths of the total students (288), i.e., 76.04% (219), answered more than half of the questions correctly. In the dosage and timing scenario, 76.3% of the students answered correctly wherein interns provided the most correct responses (91.0%). In deciding their knowledge of specific scenarios, 73.7% of the students knew when to prescribe correctly in four of five relevant scenarios, with postgraduates performing better (76.1%). Performance declined significantly when it involved evaluating scenarios deemed inappropriate for prophylaxis. Additionally, self-reported perceptions highlighted significant gaps in knowledge (38.6%) and confidence (40.9%). These deficiencies emphasize the strong need for further education, as acknowledged by two-thirds (65.4%) of the students. While most students demonstrated a basic understanding of antibiotic prophylaxis, significant shortcomings were noted, particularly in avoiding unnecessary prescriptions. To ensure appropriate prescribing practices and reduce antibiotic overuse, the integration of a standardized antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) curriculum in all dental institutions in Nepal is strongly recommended.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial misuse in surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP) can include the inappropriate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics or prolonged dosing. In 2021, a pilot antimicrobial stewardship programme (ASP) was launched in Georgia, which involved developing and adapting SAP guidelines, establishing an interprofessional SAP prescribing approach, collecting surgical site infection (SSI) data via routinely collected data and telephonic patient follow-ups, and providing surgical unit staff with prescribing feedback and training on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and antimicrobial stewardship (AMS). ASP introduction was staggered across ten hospitals over three years. This study explored behavioural determinants of surgical teams' ASP uptake in five hospitals where the ASP was introduced or about to be introduced. Findings primarily concerned epidemiologists' and nurses' ASP-related behaviour. Those at ASP non-introduced hospitals were less involved in the SAP prescribing process, had lower AMR awareness, and lacked professional development opportunities. Those at ASP-introduced hospitals exhibited higher AMR knowledge and felt ASP participation boosted confidence, facilitated work, and furnished key professional development. Results indicate interprofessional collaboration on SAP prescribing supported ASP uptake across teams, and investment in health worker training and administrative encouragement ensured effective ASP participation and implementation. Findings highlight the crucial role of epidemiologists in SAP and illustrate a need for developing Georgian nurses' AMR competencies as a vehicle to address public AMR knowledge gaps. Longer-term ASP uptake will need to consider the regulatory context in which hospitals lack access to national-level SSI data and feedback on SSI reporting but are fined for reporting non-compliance. Despite resource limitations and a small sample size, the study engaged all pilot ASP health workers. Respondents' inexperience of qualitative research participation and ensuant hesitation limited exploration of motivational factors supporting health workers' ASP uptake, which could be explored in further research.",

    "abstract": "Adherence to antimicrobial recommendations varies and is influenced by client-veterinarian communication, making adequate training related to communication and antimicrobial stewardship, especially important for veterinary students. Prior research suggests that veterinary medical students underestimate clients' antimicrobial knowledge and adherence to instructions, as well as veterinarians' communication competence. These perceptions could impact future interactions with clients, including recommendations for treatment. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore students' perceptions of client knowledge and adherence. Eleven focus groups were conducted with 33 veterinary students across all years of the curriculum to learn more about their perceptions of the efficacy of veterinary communication related to antibiotics and client adherence to instructions for antibiotic use. Results from this research show that students acknowledge the importance of communication to adherence, and this is especially important when engaging clients in discussion of antibiotics. More specifically, analysis of the transcripts revealed five main themes: the importance of client education and health literacy, navigating client expectations, barriers and enablers to client adherence, navigating generational differences among colleagues and clients, and the importance and impact of role modeling in the clinical setting. Results of this research have implications for training the next generation of veterinarians to confidently communicate about antibiotics, enhance client adherence, and increase the likelihood of positive patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The increasing threat of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) organisms highlights the need for effective antimicrobial stewardship in veterinary medicine. This study evaluated how veterinarians treating companion animals utilize antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) reports and antimicrobial use guidelines and their impact on antimicrobial selection. An online survey was distributed to veterinarians across the US, collecting data on demographics, clinical case management, AST report preferences, and perceptions of AMR, diagnostic stewardship, and antimicrobial stewardship. A total of 216 veterinarians participated. Results indicated a preference (83% to 89%) for AST reports with interpretative comments on antimicrobial selection and dosing. Most respondents (55% to 62%) preferred selective reporting over cascade reporting (25% to 30%). Clinical cases revealed the frequent selection of systemic antimicrobial therapy, with many respondents indicating the need for therapeutic consultation. Two identical cases with different AST report styles (full vs cascade) showed a 26% increase in good antimicrobial stewardship with the cascade report. Gaps in knowledge regarding AST principles were identified, with many respondents misunderstanding the establishment of breakpoints, AST and topical therapy, and the interpretation of MICs. These findings suggest that while veterinarians prefer full or selective AST reports, their antimicrobial choices align more closely with guidelines when cascade reports are used. This indicates that the AST report style may influence the antimicrobial stewardship practices of veterinarians and warrants further investigation. This study demonstrates the need for improved AST reporting and education on AST interpretation and antimicrobial selection to support antimicrobial stewardship in veterinary medicine.",

In phase 2, the protocol was updated and defined which steps should be taken for specific risk factors and situations in which antibiotics were not necessary down to the detail. A total of 9880 neonates were enrolled. The antibiotic use rate decreased from 58.1% before AMS was implemented to 51.9% in phase 1, and further to 31.7% in phase 2 (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Days of therapy per 100 patient days were 30.8, 28.3, and 24.8, respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Multidrug-resistant organism culture rate gradually decreased from 48.2% to 45.5% in phase 1, and further to 37.0% in phase 2 (p\u2009<\u20090.01). No difference in safety outcomes was observed between the intervention and baseline periods. A practical AMS led by a pharmacist can safely and successfully reduce the prescription rate of antibiotics for EOS and the incidence of multidrug-resistant bacteria.",

Establishing cautious and evidence-based prescription practices in veterinary companion animal medicine should be one of the key objectives of One Health antimicrobial stewardship initiatives. We aimed to (1) develop a training program on antimicrobial use in veterinary companion animal medicine in Quebec, Canada, (2) quantify the impact of this training on the use of highly important antimicrobials, and (3) identify the factors that could limit such an impact. A total of 54 veterinarians from 35 veterinary facilities participated in the study. Antimicrobials were identified from electronic medical records, prescription rates were calculated and a difference-in-differences estimation was used to compare prescription rates pre- and post-training in 2023, controlling for seasonal trends during the same period in 2022. Participating veterinarians prescribed on average 11.7 antimicrobial treatments per 100 consultations. Two thirds of the systemic antimicrobials prescribed by participants were antimicrobials of very high medical importance, according to Health Canada. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was the most often prescribed antimicrobial and accounted for approximately 22\u202f% of all prescriptions. The training had a limited impact on overall prescription rates. However, a reduction of 55\u202f% in prescription rate was observed for metronidazole, which is most often prescribed in canine patients with acute diarrhea. Interviews were conducted with 11 participating veterinarians to identify obstacles to the implementation of recommended prescription practices. The main obstacles identified were pet owner expectations, fear of therapeutic failure, lack of confidence in the recommendations and unavailability of therapeutic alternatives.",

    "abstract": "Inappropriate antibiotic prescription for self-limiting respiratory tract infections (RTIs) by general practitioner (GP) registrars (trainees) is less common than by established GPs but still exceeds evidence-based benchmarks. A 2014 face-to-face educational intervention for registrars and supervisors reduced registrars' acute bronchitis antibiotic prescription by 16% (absolute reduction). We aimed to establish the efficacy of an updated registrar/supervisor RTI-management intervention (delivered at distance) on antibiotic prescribing. A non-randomized trial using a non-equivalent control-group nested within the ReCEnT cohort study. The intervention included online educational modules, registrar and supervisor webinars, and materials for registrar-supervisor in-practice educational sessions, and focussed on acute bronchitis as an exemplar RTI. The theoretical underpinning was the 'capability, opportunity, and motivation' (COM-B) framework. The intervention was delivered to registrars and supervisors of one large educational/training organization annually from mid-2021, with pre-intervention period from 2017, and with postintervention period ending 2023. Two other educational/training organizations served as controls. The primary outcome was antibiotics prescribed for acute bronchitis. Analyses used multivariable logistic regression with predictors of interest: time (before/after intervention), treatment group, and an interaction term for time-by-treatment group, adjusted for potential confounders. The interaction term P-value was used to infer statistical significance of the intervention effect. Of 4612 acute bronchitis presentations, 70% were prescribed antibiotics. There was a 6.9% absolute reduction (adjusted) of prescribing in the intervention-group compared with the control-group. This was not statistically significant (Pinteraction\u2005=\u2005.22).

This case study explores the feasibility, acceptability, and usefulness of embedding the TARGET (Treat Antibiotics Responsibly, Guidance, Education and Tools) AMS training into a local incentive scheme. Black Country Integrated Care Board (ICB) invited a representative from all associated general practises to a TARGET AMS training event; attendance was linked to a local incentive scheme. Data were collected via a pre- and post-workshop survey capturing TARGET toolkit knowledge, AMS attitudes and behaviours, training feedback, and intention to implement AMS behaviours. Descriptive analyses were conducted. 157 and 101 attendees completed the pre- and post-session surveys, respectively. In total, 89% agreed that attending the session was a good use of their time. The proportions of attendees stating an intention to use the TARGET toolkit and implement a range of AMS strategies following the session were high (TARGET Toolkit: >82%, AMS strategies: >90%). Most attendees planned to implement these actions within 3 months (47%) or within 3-6 months (30%). Results suggest that embedding the training into a local incentive scheme is a viable implementation approach in extending training reach. Although the impact on prescribing rates is not yet available, the high engagement and intention to implement AMS strategies observed should inspire confidence in this approach to training implementation.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotics are the most frequently prescribed pharmacologic agents in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Antibiotic treatment for suspected or culture-negative sepsis surpasses that for culture-proven infection. Therefore, we sought to reduce our overall antibiotic utilization rate (AUR), defined by total antibiotic days per 1000 patient days (DOT/1000-PD), by 20% within a 4-year period (by December 2023). A multidisciplinary team was convened to develop an antibiotic stewardship quality improvement initiative in our 39-bed level IV NICU. Consensus guidelines for antibiotic duration for common indications were developed. Interventions included educational sessions, antibiotic stop dates, and antibiotic necessity documentation in the electronic health record to standardize provider justification for antibiotic prescription and duration. A total of 552 infants were included in the analysis, 137 in the baseline and 415 in the postintervention period. Overall AUR decreased by 50% from 278 to 140 DOT/1000-PDs. AUR related to culture-negative sepsis diagnoses decreased by 64% from 22 to 8 DOT/1000-PDs. The percent of antibiotic therapy reinitiation within 2\u00a0weeks remained unchanged. Implementation of NICU antibiotic consensus guidelines supported by evidence-based education on culture-negative sepsis diagnosis can effectively reduce antibiotic use in a safe manner, despite a heterogenous, high acuity, level IV NICU population. Multidisciplinary team support and standardization of antibiotic justification in the electronic health record can be coupled to reinforce compliance with established guidelines to promote long-lasting antibiotic reduction.",

Healthcare students, as future practitioners, must have a good understanding of AMR to contribute to antimicrobial stewardship. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of an educational intervention on healthcare students' knowledge of AMR and to assess patterns of antibiotic use prior to the intervention. A quasi-experimental pre-and-post study design was conducted with unpaired groups of healthcare students. An educational intervention was carried out comprising of two 20-minute PowerPoint lectures, as well as question and answer sessions focused on understanding the spread, impact, and prevention of AMR. A self-administered questionnaire was given as a pre-test and repeated as a post-test immediately after the training. Students' knowledge of AMR and patterns of antibiotic use was assessed pre-intervention while knowledge of AMR was assessed post-intervention. The knowledge was categorised into domains (Understanding Antibiotic and Antimicrobial Resistance; Spread and Impact of Antibiotic/Antimicrobial Resistance; Prevention of Antibiotic/Antimicrobial Resistance). The total score for each domain of knowledge tested was categorized into good knowledge (\u2265\u200980%) and poor knowledge (<\u200950%). The number of participants in the pre- and post-intervention were 185 and 157 students with average age of 17.7 years and 17.8 years respectively. Post-intervention, there was a significant increase in students' AMR knowledge, with correct responses regarding spread and impact of AMR increasing from 40.5% pre-intervention to 62.4% post-intervention (p\u2009<\u20090.001; \u03c6 (effect size\u2009=\u20090.218).

Misconceptions, such as misunderstanding that antibiotic resistance does not result from the body becoming resistant to antibiotics, persisted but not statistically significant (24.9-17.2%, p\u2009=\u20090.055). Pre-intervention also revealed varied antibiotic use patterns, including the inappropriate use of antibiotics for malaria (51.7%, (n\u2009=\u200976)), and common cold (25.2% (n\u2009=\u200937)). The study findings indicate that educational interventions can effectively improve healthcare students' knowledge of AMR, though persistent misconceptions underscore the need for more targeted educational efforts. Incorporating structured AMR content into healthcare curricula could help the students contribute to antimicrobial stewardship.

With the growth of antimicrobial stewardship programs an overall decrease in antibiotic prescribing has been observed. However, prescribing within the dental subset has remained steady. To describe implementation of an antibiotic stewardship initiative targeting proper utilization of antibiotic prophylaxis by dentists prior to dental procedures. Academic detailing, a form of educational outreach, was utilized to facilitate prescribing behavior change. An academic detailer met with dental staff in a face-to-face one-on-one manner to align prescribing with current evidence-based practice. During the encounter, developed resources were utilized to deliver key messages focusing on specific prescribing improvements, while robust conversation allowed the detailer to identify and address any prescriber motivations and/or perceived barriers. An antimicrobial stewardship initiative specific to the dental setting, utilizing academic detailing, has not been previously described in the literature. Comparisons of prescribing appropriateness before and after the intervention was performed using a one-way analysis of variance model. Additionally, a single-group generalized least-squares interrupted time series analysis was performed to estimate the impact of the intervention on the level and slope changes before and after implementation on the number of inappropriate prescriptions. There were 257 prescriptions for dental prophylaxis included in the preimplementation period and 42 prescriptions for dental prophylaxis included in the postimplementation period. Dental prophylaxis prescribing appropriateness was greater in the postimplementation period (17.6% vs. 89.8%; P < 0.001). The incidence of inappropriate prescriptions decreased by 25.39 per 1000 population (P < 0.001) between the periods.

    "abstract": "Considering the global threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), Japan implemented a national action plan in 2016 that emphasized antibiotic education for healthcare professionals. However, pharmacy education in Japan lacks comprehensive antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) content, leading to insufficient antibiotic awareness and literacy among graduates. This study aimed to assess and improve antibiotic literacy and awareness among undergraduate pharmacy students at Showa University. Students who were admitted in 2015 were given a 90-min lecture on AMS, covering acute upper respiratory infections, before their fifth-year clinical training in 2019. The lecture was delivered by a certified pharmacist in infection control. A paper-based, anonymous self-administered questionnaire survey on antibiotic knowledge and literacy was distributed to first- and fifth-year students in 2019 and fifth-year students in 2023. The questions in the survey were based on the Antibiotics Awareness Survey 2018. The survey results showed an 82-99% response rate among first- and fifth-year pharmacy students in 2019 and 2023. Although two-thirds of first-year pharmacy students lacked antibiotic knowledge, most fifth-year students had appropriate knowledge. Moreover, fifth-year students had a proper understanding of bacterial infections and antibiotic identification, which improved after clinical training and additional lectures. The percentage of students who would stop using antibiotics when they felt better dropped from 39% among first-year students to 21% among fifth-year students. Fifth-year students were more likely to dispose of leftover antibiotics and less likely to keep them than first-year students. Over 80% of students provided antibiotic counseling primarily for common cold treatments during clinical training. The survey results highlighted gaps in antibiotic awareness among Japanese pharmacy students and demonstrated the positive impact of education. This study emphasizes the need for an antibiotic literacy curriculum, especially for viral respiratory infections, to support efforts in curbing AMR. Moreover, policymakers should develop policies for developing and securing faculty that are knowledgeable in clinical infectious diseases across Japanese pharmacy schools.",

A one-day training was developed through partnerships between Henry Ford Health and nursing and midwifery organizations and teaching facilities in Nepal. Quantitative outcome and process evaluations were conducted. Qualitative process evaluation interviews were conducted with purposefully selected trainees. Trainees worked in healthcare facilities in Kathmandu Valley. A total of 126 nurses and midwives participated in the training and the quantitative evaluation. Eighteen trainees participated in the process evaluation interviews.

Key outcomes were AMS and IPC knowledge, and decision-making about empirical dispensing of antibiotics. The process evaluation focused on training content, integration into practice, implementation barriers, and recommendations for dissemination. Quantitative data analysis included descriptive and bivariate analysis. Qualitative data analysis included coding, searches, review of coded texts, and identification of patterns and themes.

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is associated with significant human and financial costs, particularly among vulnerable populations like older adults living in long-term care homes (LTCHs). Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the leading indication for antibiotic use in this population, with some estimates suggesting that up to 70% of these prescriptions may be avoidable. The purpose of this study is to develop and test novel behavioural science-informed antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) quality improvement strategies in Canadian LTCHs, which aim to decrease unnecessary testing and treatment for residents who lack the minimum clinical signs and symptoms of UTI. The quality improvement strategy is a two-pronged approach that includes 1) targeted education for essential care providers (family and friends of LTCH residents) about UTI and benefits of AMS, which strives to outline a positive role for this group in UTI management, and 2) monthly feedback to LTCH staff on their facility's urine culture ordering rates. The protocol was piloted in a single LTCH; a process evaluation of the pilot implementation served to refine the research protocol, which is being implemented in eight LTCHs across Canada using an eight-month stepped wedge randomized cluster design. This protocol represents a behavioural science-informed intervention to improve AMS across LTCHs. If successful, this model of care could be scalable across Canadian LTCHs, offering an inclusive approach that aims to empower clinicians, non-regulated healthcare staff, residents and their family and friends to improve health outcomes as antibiotic stewards.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate nurses' baseline understanding of diagnostic stewardship (DS) principles and the impact of an educational intervention on their knowledge and practices. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), driven by inappropriate antibiotic use, is a critical global health threat. Effective antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) requires integrating DS to ensure accurate diagnoses through proper test requisition, specimen handling and timely reporting. However, understanding and implementation of DS remains poor in general, contributing to inappropriate antibiotic use. Nurses play a crucial role in DS, yet their potential is underused, highlighting the need for targeted educational interventions. A quasi-experimental pre-post study conducted from September 2022 to March 2023. A gap analysis assessed nurses' baseline knowledge of DS informing the development of an online training program. In the intervention phase, pre-and post-assessments measured knowledge improvements after the intervention. In phase 1, 310 out of 517 nurses completed the gap analysis, with an average score of 6.59 out of 20 (range: 2-13; median score: 6.5). In phase 2, 228 of 613 nurses completed both pre- and post-tests, showing a significant improvement in scores from 4.69 (median 5), in pre-test to 6.22 (median 6) in post-test. The educational intervention significantly enhanced nurses' knowledge of AMR, specimen selection, culture indications and collection techniques. Sustained training is vital to strengthen diagnostic practices, reduce inappropriate antimicrobial use and combat AMR.",

    "abstract": "The pressing need for better antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) is invariably reliant on educational interventions in some form. To evaluate the effectiveness of post-qualification educational interventions for AMS behaviour change among health professionals. Seven databases were searched for articles published between 2013 and 2024 for post-qualification educational interventions aimed at health professionals to improve AMS. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental designs such as non-randomised trials, controlled and non-controlled before and after studies, and qualitative studies were considered eligible. The quality of studies was assessed using Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) criteria for RCTs and interrupted time series designs, and the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) for all other studies. Data were extracted, analysed for effectiveness, and synthesised narratively. Registration: PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO 2023 CRD42023447115). Forty-six studies were included in the review, with six meeting the EPOC criteria. The remaining forty were assessed using the MMAT. The overall risk of bias for the six studies meeting the EPOC criteria was low, but risk of bias was high for studies assessed using the MMAT. Overall, there was some evidence that formal education alone was effective in this context, but only limited evidence about what type of educational intervention, for which profession, is most effective. Our review provided an in-depth examination of post-qualification AMS interventions. We found studies were heterogeneous and quality of evidence relatively poor. High quality studies focused on establishing key components of effective educational interventions are required.",

    "abstract": "Overuse of antibiotics is frequent in nursing homes (NHs) leading to adverse events and selection of resistant bacteria. Antimicrobial stewardship interventions showed heterogeneous effects on reducing inappropriate use of antimicrobials in NHs. This study aimed (1) to analyze antimicrobial prescribing determinants in NHs; (2) to identify which resources for antimicrobial prescribing are used by NHs' physicians (3) understand which antimicrobial stewardship interventions are required and how they should be implemented in NHs. We conducted individual semi-directed interviews with NHs' prescribing physicians in Ile-de-France, France. A thematic content analysis was conducted iteratively. Thirteen interviews were conducted. Participants were mostly women, with a median age of 48 years and a median professional experience in NHs of three years. Participants included medical coordinators, general practitioners and salaried physicians. Main determinants of antimicrobial prescribing in NHs were the perceived risk of infectious complications and discomfort in residents, the difficulty in obtaining microbiological samples and the lack of healthcare professionals to monitor patients. Most participants reported using national guidelines and electronic decision support systems to guide their antimicrobial prescribing. Institutional constraints accentuate situations of doubt and prompt physicians to prescribe antimicrobials \"just in case\" despite the will to follow guidelines and the known risks of antimicrobial misuse. Physicians stated that proper antimicrobial use in NHs would require a major effort but was not judged a priority as compared to other medical issues. Producing guidelines tailored to the NH's context, performing good practice audits with feedback on antimicrobial prescribing, and reinforcing multidisciplinary relationships and discussions between city and hospital professionals were cited as potential interventions. The role of the medical coordinator was described as central. According to physicians, collaboration among stakeholders, providing support and training during the process might prove effective strategies to ensure successful implementation. Antimicrobial prescribing is a complex decision-making process involving different factors and actors in NHs. Tailored guidelines, good practice audits, strengthened multidisciplinary collaboration were proposed as key AMS interventions. Physicians emphasized the central role of the medical coordinator supported by stakeholder engagement, collaboration, training and ongoing support for successful implementation.",

An anonymised online questionnaire was distributed among Swiss general practitioners and urologists between January and October 2023 via the networks of Sentinella and the Swiss Association of Urology. The questionnaire consisted of questions on catheter management, including diagnosis, treatment and prophylaxis of CAUTI. Analysis was performed by discipline. Fisher's exact test was applied for comparisons (statistical significance with p <0.05). Out of 175 participating physicians, the majority were involved in catheter management. Urologists exhibited significantly higher levels of competence as compared to general practitioners (67.1% vs 20.9%). Although no significant differences were observed regarding diagnostic approaches between disciplines, unrecommended diagnostic methods were frequently applied. general practitioners reported that they treated non-febrile CAUTI for longer durations, while urologists indicated that they treated febrile CAUTI longer. Additionally, the use of fluoroquinolones was more prevalent among general practitioners compared to urologists, while prophylactic measures were more frequently applied by urologists. Catheter and CAUTI management entail significant uncertainty for general practitioners. CAUTI management varied notably between general practitioners and urologists in terms of treatment and prophylaxis. The use of non-recommended diagnostic approaches and drugs was common. This trend, along with inappropriate diagnostic methods and prophylaxis, may increase antimicrobial resistance and CAUTI morbidity. The study emphasises the necessity for diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship interventions, and proper training in CAUTI management for general practitioners and urologists.",

The intervention was designed as a 30-minute workshop with a simulation and script delivered online for 130 students as a part of hybrid teaching within the undergraduate curriculum. Learning outcome measures were compared between an intervention group and waitlist-control group using one-way between-groups analysis of covariance tests. Significant differences between groups were found for outcome measures related to short-term knowledge gain and confidence in IPC and AMS in small animal clinical practice. However, lateral knowledge transfer to large animal species clinical practice showed no significant differences. Student feedback indicated that the intervention was an enjoyable and engaging way to learn AMS. The intervention provided short-term knowledge gain in IPC protocols and enhanced procedural skills via active learning and motivation to learn in large groups of students. Future improvements would be to include large animal clinical scenario discussions and evaluate longer-term knowledge gain.",

These may be useful in structuring and evaluating antimicrobial prescribing education to veterinary students, but their applicability has not been evaluated. We aimed to evaluate whether the ESCMID competencies are currently taught and how relevant they are to veterinary prescribing in veterinary schools globally. A multi-center, cross-sectional survey was performed by administering an online questionnaire to academics teaching antimicrobial prescribing to veterinary students. Targeted recruitment was undertaken to ensure the representation of diverse geographical locations. Responses (48) were received from veterinary schools in Europe (26), North America (7), Asia (6), Australia (3), Central and South America (3), and Africa (3). Of the 37 ESCMID prescribing competencies, only 6 were considered only \"slightly\" or \"not at all\" relevant by more than 10% of respondents. Of the 37 competencies, 25 of the competencies were taught in more than 90% of schools and another 6 were taught in 80%-89% of schools. Time spent teaching was \"too little\" or \"far too little\" for five competencies according to more than 50% of the respondents. Additional competencies to address extra-label drug use; the use of compounded antimicrobials; the use of antimicrobials for metaphylaxis, prophylaxis, and growth promotion; and the importance rating of antimicrobials were suggested. The ESCMID antimicrobial prescribing competencies had broad relevance and were widely covered in the veterinary curriculum globally.",

Implementing community-based Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) initiatives is crucial to address the rising AMR. We developed a bespoke AMS intervention, aligned with the World Health Organization's AMS modules, as a 2-day online educational seminar for community pharmacists. The effectiveness of the workshop was evaluated using pre- and post-seminar questionnaires, focusing on AMS knowledge and attitudes towards antimicrobial usage. Among 528 participants, 489 completed both questionnaires. Pre-seminar, only 59% correctly understood the concept of antibiotic resistance reversibility, which improved to 85.9% post-seminar ( The AMS seminar was well-received and significantly improved the AMS knowledge of community pharmacists. The results underline the need for more AMS-focused interventions in this demographic in Malaysia, contributing to the development of formalized AMS programs. Such initiatives are expected to enhance antibiotic use awareness, encourage optimal antibiotic practices, and positively shift professional conduct in community settings.",

The study aimed to assess the current situation and explore potential improvements in antibiotic use among future health professionals in Romania by: (i) evaluating their self-assessed preparedness on antibiotic-related topics, (ii) understanding their perceptions of their role in antibiotic stewardship, and (iii) gathering their recommendations for optimizing antibiotic use. A survey of students' self-assessment of technical preparedness, engagement willingness, expectations, teaching preferences, training received and evolution of situation in Romania. Overall, 41 and 38 questions were asked to medical and pharmacy students respectively. Scores were calculated for preparedness, engagement willingness and teaching preferences to enable various comparisons. Exploratory factor analysis was used to explore the questionnaire construct. A total of 479 participants completed the survey- 233 medical students from 7 universities and 246 pharmacy students from 4 universities. Median overall preparedness score indicated that most students felt prepared in at least 14 questions (out of 22 for medical students, and 19 for pharmacy students). Engagement scores for medical and pharmacy students were similar (2 and 3 out of 4). Overall, more than half reported that 'yes, very likely' they received adequate training to ensure the appropriate use of antibiotics in their professional areas (n\u2009=\u2009254, 53.5%). Medical and pharmacy students with low preparedness scores expressed a need for more education. Most of both medical and pharmacy students considered the antibiotic situation in Romania 'will get worse' (n\u2009=\u2009159, 33.5%). The study's findings have important implications for the education and training of future Romanian health professionals and highlight the need for further research on optimal and standardized tools to allow for periodic monitoring and evaluation of progress into preparedness, engagement willingness and teaching preferences on antibiotic use.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP) often function naturally as facilitators within clinical hospital settings, by working with individuals and teams to reduce unnecessary antibiotics. Within implementation science, facilitation has been studied and evaluated as an implementation strategy that can accelerate and improve fidelity to implementation efforts. This study describes a novel, virtual facilitation strategy developed and served as an intervention within the optimizing perioperative antibiotics for children trial (OPERATIC trial). This paper: (1)\u00a0describes ASP team's preferences for and use of a facilitation workshop and (2)\u00a0describes sustained use of facilitation skills throughout the study period. Study participants included antimicrobial stewardship team members from the nine children's hospitals that participated in this study and completed facilitation training. All individuals who completed facilitation training were asked to evaluate the training through an online survey. Additionally, site leads were interviewed by the site coordinator every other month and asked about their team's use of facilitation skills throughout the rest of the study period. Survey data were managed and coded in R, and qualitative interview data were analyzed using rapid methodology. 30 individuals, including both physicians and pharmacists, completed the evaluation. Individuals largely rated themselves as novice facilitators (53%). Individuals reported satisfaction with virtual facilitation and identified different components of the workshops as valuable. An additional 108 interviews were performed throughout the study period. These interviews found that facilitators reported using all skills throughout the study period and described varied use of skills over time. All nine sites applied facilitation strategies, team building techniques, and communication/conflict skills at some point during the intervention phase. We describe the use of virtual facilitation as an acceptable and appropriate strategy to enhance facilitation skills for ASP teams working to reduce unnecessary postoperative antibiotics. Participants reported different useful components of facilitation training and described using differing facilitation skills throughout the trial. Overall, the use of facilitation skills continued throughout the duration of the study period. This paper outlines how facilitation training can be conducted virtually in a way that is feasible and acceptable to clinicians. NCT04366440, April 24, 2020.",

    "abstract": "We previously performed a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) in general practices and older adult care organizations in Poland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. We found that a multifaceted antibiotic stewardship intervention (ASI) substantially reduced antibiotic use for suspected urinary tract infections (UTIs) in frail older adults compared with usual care. We aimed to evaluate the implementation process of the ASI to provide recommendations for clinical practice. We conducted a process evaluation alongside the cluster RCT. The ASI consisted of a decision-tool and a toolbox, which were implemented using a participatory-action-research (PAR) approach with sessions for education and evaluation. We documented the implementation process of the intervention and administered a questionnaire to health care professionals (HCPs) from participating organizations in the intervention and usual care clusters. We evaluated the multiple components of the intervention and its implementation following a structured framework. The questionnaire was completed by 254 HCPs from the 38 participating clusters. All components were largely delivered according to plan and evaluated as useful. The decision-tool and toolbox materials were reported to facilitate decision-making on UTIs. Regarding the PAR approach, educational sessions focusing on the distinction between UTIs and asymptomatic bacteriuria were held in all 19 intervention clusters. In 17 out of these 19 clusters, evaluation sessions took place, which were reported to help remind HCPs to implement the ASI. During both sessions, HCPs valued the reflection that took place and the resulting awareness of their behavior. It allowed them to explore implementation barriers and to tailor their local implementation process to overcome these. For example, HCPs organized extra educational sessions or revised local policies to incorporate the use of the decision-tool. Various HCPs took key roles in implementation. Staff changes and the COVID-19 pandemic were important contextual barriers. We found each component of the multifaceted ASI and its implementation to have added value in the process to improve antibiotic prescribing for suspected UTIs in a heterogeneous older adult care setting. We recommend using a multifaceted, multidisciplinary approach that enables HCPs to reflect on their current practice and accordingly tailor local implementation. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03970356.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of educational programs on the knowledge and attitudes regarding AMS among veterinary students in Serbia. A structured educational program on AMS was implemented for veterinary students at the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Novi Sad. Pre- and post-symposium assessments were conducted to measure changes in students' knowledge and attitudes. The study employed a mixed-methods approach, including surveys and focus groups, to gather quantitative and qualitative data. The study resulted in significant short-term improvements in students' knowledge of AMS principles and their attitudes toward responsible antimicrobial use. Participants demonstrated a better understanding of the mechanisms of resistance and the importance of adhering to stewardship guidelines. Qualitative feedback indicated increased awareness of the consequences of inappropriate antimicrobial use and a stronger commitment to applying stewardship practices in their future careers. The educational programs effectively enhanced immediate veterinary students' knowledge and attitudes regarding AMS. These findings underscore the importance of integrating targeted educational programs into veterinary curricula to promote responsible antimicrobial use and combat resistance in veterinary practice.",

    "abstract": "Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) represent a significant burden in health care and its management is challenging. This study aims to assess and compare central European CAUTIs regarding diagnostics, treatment, and prophylaxis. An anonymized online questionnaire was distributed among urologists in Austria, France, Germany, and Switzerland between January and October 2023, consisting of demographic questions on catheter management and diagnostics, treatment, and prophylaxis of CAUTIs. An analysis was performed per country. Comparisons were done with the Fisher's exact test (statistical significance with  Out of 423 participating urologists, most regularly performed catheter changes and managed catheter-related issues, except for French urologists. Swiss urologists tended to change the catheter after a longer interval. In France, a higher estimated number of CAUTIs were observed. Diagnostic symptoms and measures varied significantly between countries. French urologists prescribed more antimicrobials per patient and administered longer treatment regimens. The choice of antimicrobial agents differed notably for nonfebrile and febrile CAUTIs, with cotrimoxazole/nitrofurantoin being common for nonfebrile cases and cephalosporin/amoxicillin for febrile ones. Follow-up protocols were similar among urologists, while prophylactic measures showed variations. CAUTI management varied notably across countries in terms of diagnostics, treatment, and prophylaxis. Discrepancies in antimicrobial therapy could be influenced by local resistance rates; yet, nonrecommended drugs and prolonged regimens, as compared with guideline recommendations, were common. This trend, along with inappropriate diagnostics and prophylaxis, may increase antimicrobial resistance and CAUTI morbidity. This study emphasizes the necessity for diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship interventions, and proper training in CAUTI management. In this questionnaire-based study examining the clinical practices for managing urinary tract infections in patients with bladder catheters (CAUTIs), significant disparities were observed among European urologists regarding diagnosis, treatment, and prophylaxis. These findings underscore the critical need for clear guidelines and comprehensive training in CAUTI management.",

    "abstract": "Despite the extensive use of antibiotics and the growing challenge of antimicrobial resistance, there has been a lack of substantial initiatives aimed at diminishing the prevalence of infections in nursing homes and enhancing the detection of urinary tract infections (UTIs). This study aims to systematize and enhance efforts to prevent health care-associated infections, mainly UTIs and reduce antibiotic inappropriateness by implementing a multifaceted intervention targeting health care professionals in nursing homes. A before-and-after intervention study carried out in a minimum of 10 nursing homes in each of the 8 European participating countries (Denmark, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain). A team of 4 professionals consisting of nurses, doctors, health care assistants, or health care helpers are actively involved in each nursing home. Over the initial 3-month period, professionals in each nursing home are registering information on UTIs as well as infection and prevention control measures by means of the Audit Project Odense method. The audit will be repeated after implementing a multifaceted intervention. The intervention will consist of feedback and discussion of the results from the first registration, training on the implementation of infection and prevention control techniques provided by experts, appropriateness of the diagnostic approach and antibiotic prescribing for UTIs, and provision of information materials on infection control and antimicrobial stewardship targeted to staff, residents, and relatives. We will compare the pre- and postintervention audit results using chi-square test for prescription appropriateness and Student t test for implemented hygiene elements. A total of 109 nursing homes have participated in the pilot study and the first registration audit. The results of the first audit registration are expected to be published in autumn of 2024. The final results will be published by the end of 2025. This is a European Union-funded project aimed at contributing to the battle against antimicrobial resistance through improvement of the quality of management of common infections based on evidence-based interventions tailored to the nursing home setting and a diverse range of professionals. We expect the intervention to result in a significant increase in the number of hygiene activities implemented by health care providers and residents. Additionally, we anticipate a marked reduction in the number of inappropriately managed UTIs, as well as a substantial decrease in the overall incidence of infections following the intervention.

This study was a nonblinded intervention study that consisted of a preintervention phase (November 2018-January 2019), an intervention phase (January 2020-December 2020) in which a multipronged behavioral intervention was implemented, and a postintervention phase (January 2021-March 2021). We examined antibiotic use for cystoscopy and transrectal prostate biopsy at 3 separate urologic outpatient clinics. A multipronged behavioral intervention consisted of formal physician education, modification of the electronic health order sets, clinic staff education, literature review, development and introduction of patient questionnaires, and individual audit feedback. The primary outcome was 30-day infections. Secondary outcomes were adherence to the recommended antibiotic protocols, questionnaire completion, and  A total of 2374 patients underwent 3047 cystoscopies, and 547 patients underwent 559 prostate biopsies. The proportions of cystoscopy patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis and prostate biopsy patients receiving augmented antibiotic prophylaxis decreased 33% and 35%, respectively. The odds of postcystoscopy infection were not different between the preintervention and intervention phases and were lower in the postintervention phase. The odds of postbiopsy infection were not changed between the preintervention and intervention phases or between the preintervention and postintervention phases. Implementing a multipronged behavioral intervention reduced and tailored antibiotic use without an increase in 30-day infections. These findings suggest that outpatient antibiotic stewardship and facilitating rapid adoption of guidelines can be accomplished via this approach.",

However, it is unclear how Dutch hospital-based nurses envision their contribution to AMS. To explore the views and visions of Dutch bedside nurses on their role regarding appropriate antimicrobial use. A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was conducted. Fourteen bedside nurses in nine different Dutch hospitals participated. Data were analysed using a thematic content analysis. Nurses considered their role regarding appropriate use of antibiotics as an integral part of their daily nursing practice. They envisioned their future role as an expansion of their current practice, improving or intensifying this contribution. Prompting review of antimicrobial treatment by nurses was seen as regular practice. Ward rounds were considered the best moment to exert their nursing role, by showing leadership in communicating about different aspects of AMS. Patient advocacy (\"striving for the best possible care for their patient\") appears to be a driver of the nursing contribution. Nurses perceived a shared responsibility with prescribers on certain aspects of the antimicrobial treatment and wished for a clarification of this role. Education and cognitive reminders such as antibiotic checklist to be used in ward rounds, can support the uptake of the nurses' role. Nurses envision their future role in AMS as an enhanced, elaborated and empowered version of their current daily practice. Education, formal acknowledgment and increased awareness of the nursing role, may advance the contributing role nurses already have.",

We identified several common themes surrounding management of asymptomatic bacteriuria from clinicians. These included an emphasis on ordering and interpreting urine tests, tension between guidelines and individual patient care for older adults, use of epidemiologic data to influence prescribing practices, pre-prepared communication talking points, and interest in educational materials for patients and clinical teams. Education about the need for symptoms to supplement urine testing, data about the impact of overuse of antibiotics, and oral and written communication strategies should be addressed to reduce antibiotic prescribing for asymptomatic bacteriuria.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance presents a significant global health threat to modern medicine. The awareness and attitude of future doctors undergoing training may play a crucial role in addressing this important issue, influencing the control of resistance and promoting responsible antibiotic stewardship. This study aimed to estimate knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding antibiotic usage and antimicrobial resistance among tertiary care teaching hospital medical interns. The questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 123 MBBS interns from multiple medical institutions. Intern's knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported practices regarding antibiotic use were recorded. Based on survey responses from 123 participants, 116 (94.31%) were aware of the adverse effects of indiscriminate antibiotic use, recognizing the risks of ineffective treatment, increased adverse effects, prolonged illness, bacterial resistance, and higher medical costs. Most (106, 86.18%) acknowledged the challenges of treating antibiotic-resistant infections, and 69 (56.10%) correctly identified that bacteria are not a cause of the common cold and flu. Most (115, 93.5%) recognized antibiotic resistance as a significant global health problem. In attitude, 90 (73%) believed antibiotics should be avoided for colds, but 80 (65%) thought they hastened fever recovery. Only 48 (39%) recognized that antibiotics contribute to resistance, while 102 (83%) agreed skipping doses fosters resistance. Most support hospital policies (118, 96%) and curriculum courses (112, 91%) for rational antibiotic use.\u00a0Regarding practice, 12 (9.76%) interns admitted to overusing antibiotics, 68 (55.28%) consulted a doctor before starting antibiotics, and 87 (70.73%) checked expiry dates. Additionally, 62 (50.41%) preferred antibiotics for cough and sore throat symptoms. The study highlights that while interns have a good knowledge and awareness of the harms of antibiotic misuse, they are not translating this knowledge into practice. This indicates a disconnect between understanding and application. Therefore, there is a need to add a rational antibiotic prescription and stewardship module to the medical curriculum to ensure that knowledge is effectively translated into changing beliefs and practices.",

The training and empowerment of nurses are the best strategies for enhancing their knowledge and engagement in ASP. This mixed-method study was used to assess perceived roles and barriers of nurses' involvement in ASP. An online survey was conducted among 420 clinical nurses to identify their role, and 23 individual interviews were performed among nurses and infection control practitioners to explore the barriers and recommendations to overcome the identified barriers. The majority of the nurses agreed with the sixteen identified roles in ASP, of which 'antibiotic dosing and de-escalation' (82.61%), 'IV to PO conversion of antibiotic, outpatient antibiotic therapy' (85.23%), and 'outpatient management, long-term care, readmission' of the patients (81.19%) had the lowest agreement from the participants. The major themes generated through the qualitative interviews were a lack of knowledge about ASP, poor communication between multidisciplinary teams, lack of opportunity and multidisciplinary engagement, lack of formal education and training about ASP, lack of ASP competency and defined roles in policy, role conflict or power/position, availability of resources, and lack of protected time. Nurses play an integral role in the successful implementation of antibiotic stewardship programs. The empowerment of nurses will help them to adopt the unique role in ASP.

Data from the Hospital NAPS was extracted for oral and dental indications from 2013 to 2022. The types of oral and dental indications presented, and the corresponding antimicrobials prescribed were assessed for compliance according to national prescribing guidelines, and appropriateness according to the NAPS structured algorithm. A total of 8,001 prescriptions for 7,477 patients were identified, from 433 hospitals. Antifungal, antibiotic and antiviral agents accounted for 84.5 %, 15.4 % and 0.03 % of prescriptions respectively. A greater proportion of antibiotics were prescribed in regional and rural areas compared to antifungals. The prescriptions assessed as compliant were 80.0 % and 44.7 % of antifungals and antibiotics respectively. Prescriptions assessed as appropriate were 84.4 % of antifungals, and 65.3 % of antibiotic prescriptions. A wide variety of antimicrobials were used with moderate levels of compliance and appropriateness. Future interventions should include targeted education, utilisation of prescribing guidelines, and tools to diagnose and manage oral and dental conditions. Consideration can be given to adjustment of the Hospital NAPS tool to cater for oral conditions and include the provision of dental treatment in the management of these infections. A wide variety of oral and dental conditions are presented in Australian hospital settings, managed by a range of antibiotics and antifungals, with moderate levels of compliance to guidelines and appropriateness. Antimicrobial stewardship strategies should target and support dentistry in hospital settings.",

Fourteen South African neonatal units (seven public, seven private sector) assembled multidisciplinary teams involving neonatologists, microbiologists, pharmacists, and nurses to implement prospective audit and feedback neonatal antimicrobial stewardship (NeoAMS) interventions. The teams attended seven online training sessions. Pharmacists conducted weekday antibiotic prescription reviews in the neonatal intensive care unit and/or neonatal wards providing feedback to the clinical teams. Anonymized demographic and NeoAMS interventions data were aggregated for descriptive purposes and statistical analysis. During the 20-week NeoAMS intervention in 2022, 565 neonates were enrolled. Pharmacists evaluated seven hundred antibiotic prescription episodes; rule-out sepsis (180; 26%) and culture-negative sepsis (138; 20%) were the most frequent indications for antibiotic prescription. For infection episodes with an identified pathogen, only 51% (116/229) of empiric treatments provided adequate antimicrobial coverage. Pharmacists recommended 437 NeoAMS interventions (0\u00b76 per antibiotic prescription episode), with antibiotic discontinuation (42%), therapeutic drug monitoring (17%), and dosing (15%) recommendations most frequent. Neonatal clinicians' acceptance rates for AMS recommendations were high (338; 77%). Mean antibiotic length of therapy decreased by 24% from 9\u00b71 to 6\u00b79 days (0\u00b71 day decrease per intervention week; P = 0\u00b7001), with the greatest decline in length of therapy for culture-negative sepsis (8\u00b72 days (95% CI 5\u00b77-11\u00b77) to 5\u00b79 days (95% CI 4\u00b76-7\u00b75); P = 0\u00b7032). This neonatal AMS programme was successfully implemented in heterogenous and resource-limited settings. Pharmacist-recommended AMS interventions had high rates of clinician acceptance. The NeoAMS intervention significantly reduced neonatal antibiotic use, particularly for culture-negative sepsis. A grant from Merck provided partial support.",

    "abstract": "The ultimate goal of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes is to decrease the occurrence and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In response to this, a pharmacist partnership was established between Malawi and Wales (UK) with the aim of strengthening antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) activities in Malawi, with the initial project focusing on two tertiary referral hospitals. The Global Point Prevalence Survey (GPPS) was undertaken for the first time in Malawi at these sites and demonstrated a prescribing rate slightly lower than the African average, with ceftriaxone indicated for almost every bacterial infection. An educational intervention was also delivered, with a train-the-trainer approach upskilling pharmacists at the two sites, who then cascaded co-produced training sessions to an additional 120 multidisciplinary health professionals. A toolkit to support AMS at an individual patient level was also developed and disseminated to provide an ongoing reference to refer to. Both the trainings and toolkit were well received. Over the course of this project, significant progress has been made with the AMS programmes at the two sites, with local staff empowered to implement AMS activities. These interventions could be easily replicated and scaled and support the delivery of some of the AMS elements of the Malawi Ministry of Health National Action Plan for Antimicrobial Resistance.",

To date, antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) efforts around IVOS have not focused on the nursing staff who administer antibiotics, which represents a significant gap in AMS programmes. To determine the involvement of bedside nurses in acute trusts in the Midlands region of England in IVOS in their organizations and describe their views regarding how to improve IVOS. An anonymous self-administered mixed-methods online survey was developed and distributed to nursing staff in acute trusts via antimicrobial stewardship networks between March and May 2023. Quantitative data was analysed to describe participant demographics and behaviours, whereas barriers and enablers to IVOS were explored through thematic content analysis of responses to open-ended questions. A total of 545 nursing staff responded to the survey. The majority (65.3%) routinely suggested IVOS to clinicians, despite only 50.6% being aware of local IVOS policies. One-third (34.7%) did not suggest IVOS, relying on doctors, believing their patients needed IV treatment, or lacked knowledge and skills to request IVOS. Content analysis of suggestions for improving the rate of IVOS proposed three major themes (People, Process, System) and identified that education and training, improved confidence and interprofessional relationships, and prompts were important drivers. Nursing staff suggest IVOS to other clinicians, but more education and resources are needed to enable and empower them in this role.",

    "abstract": "An important component in fostering the responsible use of antibiotics is training of new and future prescribers in this interdisciplinary topic. Because podcasts are playing an increasing role in medical education, we aimed to develop and evaluate a podcast format with practice and guideline-oriented learning content on antibiotic therapy for medical students and young medical professionals. We developed the concept for the podcast with the direct involvement of medical students and medical experts with teaching experience. We used video conferencing when recording the episodes in order to have quick, easy, and nationwide access to the experts involved. We released an episode every 2 to 4 weeks on the popular podcast platforms. The podcast was promoted through mailing lists, social and print media, and at conferences. The evaluation of episodes was based on user data provided by the platforms and an anonymous feedback questionnaire linked to each episode in the podcast notes. Between December 2021 and December 2022 19 episodes of InfectEd: der Antibiotika-Podcast were released. The mean duration of an episode was 91\u00a0min. By March 9, 2023, a total of 38,829 downloads and streams had been recorded. The majority of users listened to the podcast on a mobile device. The average playing time per episode was 65%. The feedback questionnaire was completed 135 times. 60.7% of respondents were female, 38.5% male. The majority of respondents were in their twenties and thirties (66.7%). 31.1% were medical students, 25.9% were residents, and 25.2% were specialists. Listeners were asked to rate episodes on a scale from 1 to 6, where 1 was \"very good\" and 6 was \"insufficient.\" Ratings did not differ significantly between female and male respondents or between medical students and others. 118 respondents (87.4%) reported an increase in knowledge. Free-text feedback frequently emphasized clinical and also exam relevance. Our podcast format, developed with a user-centered approach, was broadly distributed and has been well accepted by both medical students and physicians alike. It provides a large number of learners with low-threshold access to current, guideline-orientated content and could be a useful supplement to conventional teaching formats.",

    "abstract": "Most antibiotics are prescribed, dispensed, and consumed in the community setting. Community pharmacists have a great potential to optimise antibiotic use and mitigate antibiotic resistance in this setting through antibiotic stewardship. This commentary aims to highlight critical areas where community pharmacists can contribute to optimising antibiotic use and to offer suggestions for how this can be implemented in practice. Currently, the role of the community pharmacist is mostly limited to dispensing of antibiotics and treatment of minor infectious ailments. This role needs to evolve to optimise antibiotic use and mitigate resistance development. Following the Social Care Framework for applying person-centred healthcare, there are five strategies through which the role of the community pharmacist can evolve: awareness, adjustment, assistance, alignment, and advocacy. Concretely, this could include many different activities such as better informing and counselling patients, optimising antibiotic treatment duration and choice, exact quantity dispensing, performing point-of-care tests, pharmacist prescribing of antibiotics, and joining academic detailing and public health campaigns. To achieve this, education, policy, and research need to be further aligned. In many countries, pharmacy education on antimicrobial stewardship needs a stronger basis in universities, followed by early career specialisation and continuous professional development. National and international policy changes are needed to recognise such specialisations and allow more advanced pharmacy services. Pharmacy research must be expanded and tailored to the community setting with innovative and practice-based designs. This will allow community pharmacists to fully embrace an enhanced position in antibiotic use and primary care.",

    "abstract": "The global emergence of multiresistant pathogens threatens the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapies and calls for a\u00a0rational use of antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals. The main reason for the development of resistance is the inappropriate use of these substances in human and veterinary medicine and agriculture. Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) combines strategies for optimizing prescribing practices in order to prevent the development of resistance, ensure successful treatment, and minimize side effects. Central elements are evidence-based guidelines, interdisciplinary visits, infectious disease consults, targeted training, feedback systems, and digital support. AMS is becoming increasingly established in Germany, but many antibiotics are still not prescribed in line with guidelines. Correct diagnosis, guideline-based empirical therapy, regular re-evaluation, dose adjustment, early oral administration, and outpatient parenteral anti-infective therapy (OPAT) are essential. Short, individually adapted treatment durations improve tolerability and reduce resistance pressure. AMS links epidemiological data with patient-specific factors and is key in personalized infection medicine. Only the consistent integration of AMS measures into everyday clinical practice can ensure the sustained efficacy of antimicrobial substances and improve the quality of patient care in the long term. Das weltweite Auftreten multiresistenter Erreger bedroht die Wirksamkeit antimikrobieller Therapien und fordert ein Umdenken im Umgang mit Antibiotika, Virostatika und Antimykotika. Hauptursache f\u00fcr die Resistenzentwicklung ist der h\u00e4ufig unsachgem\u00e4\u00dfe Einsatz dieser Substanzen in Human- und Veterin\u00e4rmedizin sowie in der Landwirtschaft. Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) b\u00fcndelt Strategien zur Optimierung der Verschreibungspraxis, um Resistenzentwicklung zu verhindern, Therapieerfolge zu sichern und Nebenwirkungen zu minimieren. Zentrale Elemente sind die Etablierung evidenzbasierter Leitlinien, interdisziplin\u00e4rer Visiten, eines infektiologischen Konsilwesens, gezielter Schulungen und von Feedbacksystemen. In Deutschland etabliert sich AMS zunehmend, dennoch werden viele Antiinfektiva weiterhin nicht leitliniengerecht verordnet. Die korrekte Infektionsdiagnosestellung, leitlinienbasierte empirische Therapie, regelm\u00e4\u00dfige Reevaluation, Dosisanpassung, fr\u00fchzeitige Oralisierung sowie die ambulante parenterale Antiinfektivatherapie (APAT) sind essenzielle AMS-Werkzeuge. Kurze, individuell angepasste Therapiedauern verbessern die Vertr\u00e4glichkeit und reduzieren Resistenzdruck. AMS verkn\u00fcpft epidemiologische Daten mit patientenindividuellen Faktoren und ist ein Schl\u00fcssel zu personalisierter Infektionsmedizin. Durch die konsequente Integration von AMS-Ma\u00dfnahmen in den klinischen Alltag kann die nachhaltige Wirksamkeit antimikrobieller Substanzen gesichert und die Qualit\u00e4t der Patientenversorgung langfristig verbessert werden.",

The paper aims to assess how this policy aligns with international models of nurse prescribing, evaluating its potential to enhance workforce flexibility, and identifying some challenges and opportunities regarding its implementation. While this reform may reduce pressures on general practitioners and optimize primary care delivery, it raises questions regarding diagnostic accuracy, restricted formularies and the need for rigorous surveillance. The viewpoint highlights the importance of robust training in diagnostic and clinical reasoning, regular updates to antibiotic formularies and comprehensive auditing mechanisms to ensure safe and effective prescribing. Additionally, we explore broader considerations, such as professional incentives and inter-professional collaboration, essential for the sustained impact of nurse prescribing.

    "abstract": "We aimed to achieve a 15% reduction in days of antibiotic therapy (DOT) and a 20% increase in access antibiotic group (narrower spectrum of the World Health Organization classification) units after 24\u00a0weeks of implementing an antibiotic stewardship program (ASP) in 2 pediatric hospitals. We implemented a quality improvement (QI) initiative preceded by a formative phase to identify barriers and facilitators. The strategy included developing an antibiotic management program, establishing a data management and learning system, and fostering teamwork and effective communication. The intervention spanned 2 learning sessions, each with an action period, and was supported by coaching and QI training. Primary outcomes included DOT per 1000 hospital days and the access antibiotic group use percentage. We examined the implementation of change ideas and adherence to clinical pathways for process measures using mortality rates as a balancing measure. Run charts tracked follow-up outcomes, with control charts employed once sufficient data points were collected. We gathered data from 249 patients during the baseline period (BP) (Jan 2022 to June 2022) and from 588 patients during the implementation period (IP) (July 2022 to January 2023). The IP group included younger patients with higher rates of acute lower respiratory tract infections and more severe clinical conditions. Access antibiotic group consumption was 30.7% in BP and 37.9% in IP. Concerning antibiotic DOT, throughout time, we observed variable results with many points outside the control limits, with an average of 854 in BP and 1068 in IP. The QI initiative demonstrated that ASP implementation in pediatric hospitals was associated with antibiotic narrow-spectrum selection.",

We conducted interviews with 19 veterinarians (January-July 2022) to explore factors influencing antibiotic prescribing for cats and dogs. Thematic analysis was performed using a VALUE model and themes were segmented by consultation touchpoints. We observed that veterinary clinics in Singapore heavily prioritised business viability. Existing antibiotic stewardship efforts driven by individual veterinarians were often justified as meeting pet owners' satisfaction instead. National guidelines being loosely followed, but AMR-related values and practices were mostly aligned to those of key decision-making veterinarians. Open discussions on antibiotic prescribing amongst different veterinary professionals and shared decision-making (SDM) with pet owners were common. Audits were welcomed by veterinarians but resource limitations were a major concern. Recommendations to support veterinarians in prescribing antibiotics appropriately for cats and dogs range from formalising antibiotic stewardship as a clinic value, providing collective training for all veterinary professionals, continuing SDM with pet owners, automating tracking of meaningful indicators for monitoring and evaluation, and setting up a feedback system to inform behaviour change.",

    "abstract": "The development of nursing competencies in antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) is influenced by a two-dimensional model, encompassing both internal and environmental factors. In the context of Italian clinical nursing, this study aims to assess and measure these aspects. Employing a cross-sectional online survey design, nurses from various clinical specialties in Italy were involved. The questionnaire assessed individual variables, knowledge, attitudes, practices, as well as structural and process-related variables influencing AMS. Statistical analyses were performed, encompassing descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and multiple linear regression. A total of 1,651 nurses aswered the survey, with a participation rate of 50.8%. The participant demographic revealed that 77% were female, and they had an average of 15 years of experience. Workplace and regional factors were found to significantly impact both AMS practices and attitudes. Surgical nurses reported higher practices scores (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.467, P\u2009<.01), while critical care nurses scored lower (\u03b2= -0.398, P\u2009<.01). Regarding perceptions of structure, workplace characteristics significantly influenced nurses' scores, indicating lower perceptions among surgical nurses compared to their medical counterparts (\u03b2= -0.315, P\u2009<.01). The study reveals the intricate interplay between internal and external factors that impact nurses' AMS competence. This underscores the urgent need for targeted interventions and education initiatives to enhance nurses' AMS competencies.

    "abstract": "Introduction Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) is a global initiative aimed at promoting the responsible use of antimicrobials to combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a critical global health threat. In New Zealand, over 95% of antibiotics are prescribed in the community, with estimates suggesting that half of these prescriptions are for self-limiting respiratory infections, contributing significantly to AMR. Registered nurses (RNs), especially nurse practitioners and designated nurse prescribers, are well-positioned to play a pivotal role in AMS efforts due to their accessibility and broad skill set. However, their potential remains underutilised in AMS programmes. Aim This study aimed to explore the role of New Zealand M\u0101ori and non-M\u0101ori registered nurses as antimicrobial stewards within the New Zealand health care system. Methods The current knowledge and involvement in activities that mitigate the risks of infectious diseases and AMR of registered nurses was assessed. The educational and organisational support needed to enhance their leadership and engagement in AMS initiatives were identified. Results Findings highlight the need for targeted AMS education, greater participation in stewardship activities, and clarity in RN roles in collaboration with other health care professionals. This research underscores the importance of empowering registered nurses through education and organisational support to strengthen AMS and mitigate the growing threat of AMR. Discussion This study provides key insights into the leadership potential of RNs in AMS and offers recommendations for future policy and education strategies to optimise their role in New Zealand's health care.",

Dental students' perceptions about the topic have been underexplored in the Asia-Pacific region, a key location for the development and spread of AMR. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the awareness and confidence to prescribe antimicrobials amongst dental students studying in the region. Students from 15 dental schools in 4 countries were invited to participate in a cross-sectional online survey during 2022-2023. A previously validated and standardised 14-item instrument was utilised. In all, 1413 responses were collected from Australia (n = 165), Sri Lanka (n = 112), Japan (n = 173), and Vietnam (n = 963). Of those, 201 were from final-year students (14.2%). On a scale from 1 to 10, awareness on AMR was placed at a mean (SEM) priority of 8.09 (0.05). With regards to target areas to address for mitigation of the AMR crisis, participants placed general public awareness at the top (mean [SEM] 8.53 [0.05]). Final-year students presented a mean (SEM) level of confidence to prescribe antibiotics of 6.01 (0.14) on a scale from 1 to 10, whilst 59.7% and 56.8% indicated feeling pressured to prescribe by patients or when lacking time, respectively. Final-year students participating in research activities assigned a higher priority to AMR compared to their peers not involved in research (mean [SEM] 8.6 [0.19] vs 7.81 [0.16]; P = .01). This study highlights a need for increased awareness and confidence to prescribe amongst dental students in the Asia-Pacific region, an understudied population thus far. To mitigate this issue, the implementation (followed by assessment) of local educational and antibiotic stewardship initiatives is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotics are widely used in the pediatric population, and their inappropriate use contributes to antibiotic resistance, which is a growing concern in developing countries. Therefore, this national cross-sectional study aimed to assess community pharmacists' knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding appropriate antibiotic use and dosing in pediatric patients and to explore the barriers to such use in Palestine. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted among community pharmacists on the West Bank, Palestine, from September 2022 to March 2023. The survey assessed the pharmacists' sociodemographic characteristics; knowledge, practices, and attitudes toward antibiotic use; and understanding of antibiotic dosing. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and the factors affecting pharmacists' knowledge were evaluated. The study included 301 community pharmacists, with an average age of 30.06 years, who were primarily female (75.1%). The majority of the pharmacists (80.1%) correctly believed that antibiotics are effective against bacterial infections. However, 18.3% believed that antibiotics are effective against viruses. While 61.8% knew that antibiotics kill germs, 32.0% were unaware that not all antibiotics require refrigeration. Furthermore, 67.8% were aware that antibiotics do not speed up recovery from diarrhea. Over 99% of the participants recognized that antibiotic resistance developed due to various resistant mechanisms. The majority (78.7%) believed that each infection needed a different antibiotic. Pharmacists demonstrated reasonable knowledge of antibiotic dosing in case scenarios. Knowledge was positively correlated with years of experience (P\u2009=\u20090.001). This study revealed that community pharmacy professionals have a good understanding of antibiotic usage in pediatric patients. The findings suggest that professional expertise and quality training improve healthcare services. However, the results may not be universally applicable, as identifying knowledge gaps is necessary to help with the development of focused interventions. Therefore, ongoing educational initiatives, awareness campaigns and antibiotic stewardship programs are recommended.",

This study evaluated what final-year optometry students and optometrists understood about antimicrobial stewardship in eye care and considered relevance to oral prescribing and education. A knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) questionnaire was developed comprising four sections: i) demographic questions, ii) 10 multiple choice questions regarding Knowledge about antimicrobial agents and likely pathogens, diagnosis, treatment, and preventing resistance, iii) 10 Likert rating scale questions about thoughts and Attitudes, iv) mix of question types (5\u00d7 MCQ: course of action, 16 Likert scale: confidence) related to Practice (diagnosis, management, and prescribing). Descriptive analyses were conducted (medians, mean\u00b1SD, and distributions). Thirteen students and 36 optometrists completed the survey. Both groups had a good understanding of microbial resistance and antibiotic prescribing for ocular conditions; average knowledge scores were 9.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7 and 8.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1 for students and practitioners, respectively. Scores were neutral to agree for questions related to the need for more educational programs. The answers of practice-related MCQs had a dichotomy of answers indicating a diversity of opinion, as can be the case in practice. Average total practice confidence scores were approximately 57/80 for students and 68/80 for optometrists. Optometrists and students were very confident in their ability to conduct an appropriate case history and use their knowledge and clinical skills, including slit lamp anterior eye assessment. The lowest confidence scores were for conducting microbial testing, i.e. taking swabs for pathology. Student and optometrist knowledge, attitudes, and practice around antimicrobial stewardship were high and in line with other health professions globally.

Antimicrobial stewardship programs may create and implement interventions at the point of urine test ordering, urine test resulting, or at the point of prescribing antibiotics after results have returned. Specific design and implementation of stewardship interventions depends on context. To maximize their impact, interventions should be accompanied by education and garner buy-in from providers.
