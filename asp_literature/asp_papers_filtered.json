    "abstract": "Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing remains a persistent problem, with significant knowledge gaps among students and physicians. We evaluated 180 antibiotic prescriptions showing 68% were inconsistent with trust guidelines, highlighting the need for targeted interventions.\nParticipants undertook a week-long program comprising interactive presentations, charts, newsletters, and the Micro-Sim simulation. Acting as infection doctors, they managed bleeps and advised on ten structured cases including assessing a septic mannikin. Pre- and postintervention questionnaires assessed knowledge, supplemented by qualitative feedback.\nAcross 10 sessions (\nWe plan to train regional facilitators and develop a virtual version of Micro-Sim to enable international dissemination.",

    "title": "Emerging Role of Emergency Physicians in Antimicrobial Stewardship.",
    "authors": "Taniguchi H",
    "year": 2025,
    "journal": "Cureus",
    "abstract": "The emergency department (ED) is increasingly recognized as a critical site for antimicrobial stewardship, where most initial antibiotic decisions occur, and emergency physicians (EPs), previously regarded as primarily focused on empiric treatment, are now emerging as leaders. Policy milestones, including accreditation standards and national guidelines, have catalyzed this transition, yet physician roles remain heterogeneous, and evidence on long-term outcomes is limited. Drawing on English-language literature, including intervention studies, descriptive reports, and policy documents, this editorial highlights how EPs contribute through guideline development, audit and feedback, culture follow-up, formulary oversight, rapid diagnostics, and educational initiatives. Evidence consistently shows improvements in prescribing appropriateness, reduced use of broad-spectrum agents, and faster optimization without compromising safety. However, barriers such as time pressure, professional culture, role ambiguity, and limited resources remain persistent. Importantly, the leadership of EPs has proven central in overcoming these obstacles, especially when supported by institutional commitment and integrated workflows. Their engagement is not only improving immediate prescribing practices but also represents a critical frontline defense against antimicrobial resistance and multidrug-resistant organisms. Looking forward, formalizing physician leadership, embedding stewardship in emergency medicine training, and building ED-specific data systems are essential to sustain safe and effective antibiotic use.",

    "abstract": "Medication Use Evaluations (MUEs) are structured quality improvement tools used to optimize medication use within healthcare systems. MUEs can explore safety concerns, high costs, or inappropriate use associated with any medication, among other factors. This can offer a valuable opportunity for Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASPs) to promote stewardship goals, which often overlap with these concerns for specific antimicrobials. MUEs can also provide an avenue to promote interdisciplinary collaboration with targeted groups relevant to the ASP's goals as well as an opportunity to give trainees ownership of system-facing stewardship projects. Stewardship pharmacists may often have experience with leading this process as part of their training, but MUEs represent a gap in training for physicians. Here we provide guidance on how stewardship physicians can engage in the MUE process, from identifying relevant topics to interpreting findings and supporting implementation efforts, allowing them to contribute effectively even without prior MUE experience.",
