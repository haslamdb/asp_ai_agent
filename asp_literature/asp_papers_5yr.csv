41176483,Maternal vaccination to prevent neonatal infections and combat antimicrobial resistance.,"Galiza EP, Nakebembe E, Mboizi R, Okek E, Le Doare K",2025,Seminars in fetal & neonatal medicine,"Maternal vaccination during pregnancy is emerging as a powerful strategy in protecting newborns from infectious diseases, improving neonatal outcomes, and potentially reducing antimicrobial use and resistance. Maternal immunisation works by eliciting protective antibodies in the mother that are transferred to the fetus transplacentally and through breastmilk postnatally to provide the infant with passive immunity during the first vulnerable months of life. There is sufficient evidence to support the role of maternal vaccination in averting many neonatal infections that would otherwise require medical intervention. By preventing infections in mothers and their newborn, maternal vaccination also holds significant potential for reducing antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance. Fewer neonatal infections translate to a reduced need for antimicrobial use in the neonatal period and in postpartum women, therefore lowering the selective pressure for drug-resistant bacteria. Routine maternal vaccines (tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis (Tdap), influenza, COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus) already confer measurable antibiotic-sparing benefits by preventing infections that typically trigger antimicrobial therapy in mothers and neonates. Pipeline candidates (Group B Streptococcus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli) could further lower neonatal sepsis burden, reducing broad-spectrum antimicrobial use in neonatal intensive care units to help slow antimicrobial resistance. Integrated with antibiotic stewardship and infection-prevention measures, maternal immunisation offers a practical, scalable practice to limit perinatal antibiotic exposure.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41176483/,10.1016/j.siny.2025.101680
41173019,Effect of decreasing the frequency of screening for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis on the incidence of these infections and antimicrobial use among men who have sex with men using HIV PrEP in Belgium: a retrospective cohort study.,"Vanbaelen T, De Baetselier I, Tsoumanis A, Hensen B, Kenyon C",2025,The Lancet. Microbe,"There is growing evidence that the benefits of systematic screening for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis among men who have sex with men (MSM) using HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are scarce and that screening leads to high antimicrobial consumption. The PrEP clinic of the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM) in Antwerp, Belgium, discontinued systematic screening for these infections in MSM taking PrEP in 2023. In this study, we estimated the effect of reducing the frequency of screening on the incidence of these infections and antimicrobial use among MSM using PrEP.
We did a retrospective cohort analysis of medical records, laboratory results, and antimicrobial prescriptions (ceftriaxone, doxycycline, and azithromycin) of MSM attending the PrEP clinic of the ITM in Antwerp, Belgium, between Jan 1, 2019, and Dec 31, 2024. We estimated yearly testing rates for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis, incidence rates of overall and symptomatic infections, and antimicrobial prescription rates. Results were analysed using Poisson regression, with the number of events as the outcome, years as a continuous predictor and the log(person-time) as offset. Additionally, we did three sensitivity analyses: limiting our study population to individuals engaged in PrEP care in 2019; excluding participants of the Gonoscreen study; and using time as a categorical variable.
Between Jan 1, 2019, and Dec 31, 2024, 3955 MSM attended the clinic. Over the study period, 11 720 tests were done during 9853·85 person-years. The testing rate decreased significantly from 2267·78 tests per 1000 person-years (95% CI 2176·49-2361·92) in 2019 to 552·81 tests per 1000 person-years (521·53-585·47) in 2024 (yearly rate ratio 0·78, 95% CI 0·77-0·78; p<0·0001). The incidence of N gonorrhoeae decreased from 170·84 cases per 1000 person-years (95% CI 146·47-198·11) in 2019 to 85·81 cases per 1000 person-years (73·77-99·27) in 2024 (yearly incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0·91, 95% CI 0·88-0·94; p<0·0001). In the same period, the incidence of C trachomatis decreased from 198·17 cases per 1000 person-years (95% CI 171·85-227·39) in 2019 to 60·69 cases per 1000 person-years (50·63-72·16) in 2024 (yearly IRR 0·84, 95% CI 0·81-0·87; p<0·0001). There was no increase in the incidence of symptomatic N gonorrhoeae (IRR 0·98, 95% CI 0·92-1·03), C trachomatis (0·95, 0·88-1·01), or lymphogranuloma venereum (0·95, 0·84-1·09). Ceftriaxone, doxycycline, and azithromycin prescriptions decreased (rate ratio 0·95, 95% CI 0·91-0·99; p=0·023, 0·47, 0·43-0·52; p<0·0001, and 0·90, 0·87-0·94; p<0·0001, respectively). Similar results were found in the first sensitivity analysis. In the sensitivity analysis excluding participants of the Gonoscreen study, rates of ceftriaxone and doxycycline prescriptions decreased between 2019 and 2024 but became non-significant. In the third sensitivity analysis, using time as a categorical variable, the prescription rates of ceftriaxone were lower in 2024 compared with 2019 and the incidence rates of symptomatic C trachomatis were significantly lower in 2024 compared with 2019.
The incidence of symptomatic N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis infections did not increase over time despite less frequent screening and antimicrobial prescriptions decreased. Our findings contribute to the evidence supporting the potential of reducing the frequency of screening as an antimicrobial stewardship intervention among MSM using PrEP. Future studies are needed to confirm our findings.

This retrospective single-center study included 76 adult patients treated with continuous-infusion OPAT via elastomeric pumps between 2019 and 2024 at the University Hospital of Trieste, Italy.
A total of 1,934 elastomeric pump-based OPAT days were delivered (median duration of 22.9 days). Clinical cure was achieved in 85.5% of patients; recurrence and failure occurred in 6.2% and 7.9%, respectively. Most frequent indications were skin/soft tissue and surgical site infections (25.9%), complicated urinary tract infections (22.4%), and bone/joint infections (16.4%). Pathogens were mainly Gram-negative (70.7%), including Enterobacterales (40.2%, 57.6% ESBL-producing), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (26.8%), and Staphylococcus aureus (17.1%, 28.6% methicillin-resistant S. aureus). The most used antibiotics were piperacillin/tazobactam (51.3%), cefepime (12.5%) and ceftolozane/tazobactam (7.5%). Adverse events were observed in 13.75% of treatments, primarily vascular access-related (5.7 events/1,000 OPAT-days); drug-related adverse events occurred in 7.8% of patients (3.1 events/1,000 OPAT-days). Among contacted patients (75% response rate), 83.7% expressed willingness to reuse the pump. Total OPAT costs were €62,190.64 compared to an estimated €773,600.00 for inpatient care, yielding a 92% cost reduction (€711,409 saved).
Elastomeric pump-based OPAT is a clinically effective, well-tolerated, and economically advantageous option for selected infections. Its integration into stewardship programs supports broader implementation within modern, sustainable infectious disease care models.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41171511

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to rapidly identify obligate anaerobic gram-negative bacteria directly from positive blood culture broth (PBCB) samples. This retrospective pre- and post-intervention study included patients with blood cultures positive for anaerobic gram-negative organisms, comparing outcomes before and after the implementation of a direct-from-PBCB MALDI-TOF MS workflow. The primary outcome was the time from Gram stain to organism identification. A secondary outcome was the time to first antibiotic modification (escalation or de-escalation). In monomicrobial anaerobic bloodstream infections, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) time from Gram stain to pathogen identification was significantly reduced in the post-intervention group compared to the pre-intervention group (15.0 hours [IQR: 7.8-47.8] vs 45.3 hours [IQR: 41.5-49.3]; ",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41171000/,10.1128/spectrum.02383-25

However, oral diseases such as gingivitis, dental caries, periodontitis and peri-implantitis can occur when pathogenic microbes settle in the oral cavity and become part of the oral biofilm. There are several preventative and therapeutic strategies available today, but the majority of them are centered on antibiotics. Antibiotic stewardship in dentistry might be a helpful strategy to maximize and prevent inappropriate or even needless antibiotic usage, marking a step towards precision medicine, given the current context of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Additionally, efforts are being made to discover novel, efficient treatments that can take the place of antibiotics.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41170114

A cross-sectional survey was conducted across 64 sub-districts in eight divisions of Bangladesh, assessing the KAP concerning antibiotic use (ABU) and antibiotic resistance (ABR) through a pretested questionnaire. A total of 1,248 participants took part in the KAP survey. Data collection methods included face-to-face interactions, email, and courier services, followed by subsequent analysis.
The results revealed that registered veterinarians achieved a 100% knowledge score regarding recommended doses and standard practices. While farmers and informal practitioners generally agreed with some antibiotic practices, 10.71% recognized the importance of withdrawal periods, 11.07% acknowledged public health risks, and 5.71% understood the residual effects of antibiotics. Similarly, among informal practitioners, awareness was low, with only 14.46%, 16.75%, and 7.71%, respectively. These findings show that many farmers and informal practitioners have limited KAP regarding antibiotic use and resistance. The analysis showed that demographic factors, such as education had a significant impact on participants' KAP (OR=8.06; 95% CI: 6.07-10.70; p< 0.001) regarding ABU and ABR. In particular, registered veterinarians were nearly three times more likely to have accurate KAP compared to those with lower education levels (aOR = 2.78; 95% CI: 1.94-4.00; p< 0.001). Importantly, the correlation matrix indicated strong and statistically significant positive relationships among knowledge, attitudes, and practices (p<0.001).
These findings demonstrate a strong interplay between knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding ABU and ABR in ruminants and chickens.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41167270/,10.1016/j.jgar.2025.10.020

31374443",Antibiotic use in poultry farming: a cross-sectional study of veterinary practices in Tunisia.,"Ben Ali M, Chtioui B, Bouchrit H, Laamiri H, Attia El Hili H",2025,Frontiers in antibiotics,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in poultry production poses a growing public health threat due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria and the risk of transmission to humans through direct or indirect contact with these germs. In Tunisia, limited data on antibiotic use and veterinary prescribing practices hinder the development of effective AMR mitigation strategies, particularly in a sector with high antibiotic consumption. A cross-sectional study was conducted among veterinarian prescribers in avian medicine in Tunisia to assess their antibiotic prescribing behaviours and related practices and to evaluate their potential contribution to AMR emergence and spread. The most frequently reported first and second-line antibiotics were enrofloxacin (20/52 and 14/52), florfenicol (14/52 and 14/52), and doxycycline (7/52 and 6/52). Colistin (10/52) was the most used third-line antibiotic. These antibiotics were often administered without microbiological confirmation. Although 69% had access to accredited labs, 42% relied on rapid antimicrobial susceptibility tests (RASTs). Waste management practices were inadequate, with 50% disposing of biological waste in regular trash and 42% discarding expired antibiotics into the environment. Additionally, 77% reported frequent farmer self-medication. These findings highlight the urgent need for targeted training, improved surveillance, and the application of the One Health approach to tackle AMR in Tunisia's poultry sector.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41164358

38801517",Advanced Insights Into Intravascular Bloodstream Infections: A Cross-Sectional Study of the Molecular Characterization of World Health Organization Priority Pathogens and Antimicrobial Resistance Patterns at a Tertiary Care Hospital.,"Reddy A L, Cp R, N S, Jk SP",2025,Cureus,"Introduction Bloodstream infections (BSIs), particularly intravascular types such as catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) and infective endocarditis (IE), represent a significant public health challenge due to their high morbidity and potential to rapidly progress to sepsis. The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens necessitates molecular surveillance to inform effective antimicrobial strategies, especially in regions like India, where resistance data is limited. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted over seven months, enrolling 101 patients from cardiology, nephrology, and ICUs at a tertiary care hospital in Chennai. Patients with confirmed intravascular BSIs were identified using clinical criteria and modified Duke's definitions. Blood cultures and catheter tip analyses were performed using standard microbiological techniques. Phenotypic resistance mechanisms were assessed via extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), methicillin resistance, and CARBA NP testing. Molecular characterization included polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of resistance genes (blaKPC, blaNDM, blaCTX-M, blaTEM, OXA-23, OXA-48, mecA). Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 31.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Means and proportions were reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results The cohort included patients aged 13-68 years, with a male predominance (70 patients, 70%). CRBSIs accounted for 86 cases (85%). All patients underwent internal jugular vein (IJV) catheterization, primarily for hemodialysis in chronic kidney disease (CKD) (68 patients, 68%). Blood culture positivity was observed in 49 patients (48.5%), with Klebsiella pneumoniae (14 patients, 13.9%), Pseudomonas spp. (10 patients, 9.9%), and Staphylococcus aureus (8 patients, 7.9%) as dominant isolates. ESBL production was highest in Escherichia coli (four out of five isolates, 80%) and Klebsiella (10 out of 14 isolates, 71.4%). Carbapenemase genes blaNDM and blaKPC were detected in five out of 14 Klebsiella isolates (35.7%), while OXA-23 was found in five out of six Acinetobacter isolates (83.3%). A significant correlation was found between catheter duration and culture positivity using a scatter plot demonstration. Targeted antimicrobial therapy was successful in 71 patients (70%), although complications such as persistent bacteremia and septic shock were noted. Conclusions This study underscores the high prevalence of CRBSIs and the concerning presence of molecular resistance markers in key pathogens. The predominance of carbapenemase genes such as blaNDM, blaKPC, and OXA variants highlights the urgent need for molecular diagnostics and robust antibiotic stewardship in India. Continued surveillance of intravascular BSIs and resistance profiles is essential to improve clinical outcomes and combat antimicrobial resistance.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41164032

39482320","Unraveling behavioral and sociocultural factors that shape antimicrobial use among patients and general public, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, a qualitative study.","Muhammed OS, Serbessa MK, Fenta TG",2025,Journal of pharmaceutical health care and sciences,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a critical global health threat, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In Ethiopia, high infectious disease burdens, unregulated antimicrobial access, and low awareness exacerbate inappropriate use, accelerating AMR. While microbiological aspects of AMR are studied, behavioral and sociocultural factors influencing antimicrobial use remain underexplored. This study investigates these factors in Addis Ababa to inform strategies for mitigating AMR and improving public health outcomes.
This qualitative study, conducted from April to May 2025 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, involved 25 in-depth interviews with patients and the general public across five public health facilities and three community pharmacies. Participants were selected using purposive and convenience sampling techniques. Semi-structured interviews, explored behavioral and sociocultural determinants of antimicrobial use. A codebook was refined iteratively by two coders to ensure consistency. Data were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using Dedoose software through thematic analysis. Ethical approval was obtained, and confidentiality was maintained throughout. The identified themes were linked with Theoretical domains framework domains to enhance the depth of understanding.
Five key themes emerged: limited knowledge and misconceptions about antimicrobials, with many viewing them as universal cures; prevalent self-medication and non-prescription use, driven by accessibility and trust in pharmacists; varied healthcare-seeking behaviors, influenced by trust and logistical barriers; sociocultural influences, including peer advice and traditional beliefs combining antibiotics with remedies; and structural and economic barriers, such as limited healthcare access and high costs, promoting misuse. These factors, rooted in knowledge gaps, cultural norms, and systemic weaknesses, contribute significantly to inappropriate antimicrobial use and AMR.
The study highlights how misconceptions, self-medication, sociocultural norms, and structural barriers drive inappropriate antimicrobial use in Addis Ababa, exacerbating AMR. Multifaceted interventions are needed, including community education to address knowledge gaps, stricter prescription regulations, improved healthcare access through expanded insurance and clinics, and engagement with cultural leaders to align practices with evidence-based use. These strategies can mitigate AMR while ensuring equitable access to effective treatments, addressing both behavioral and systemic challenges.

This study elucidated their prevalence and associated factors among university students in Vietnam.
Cross-sectional study.
Vietnam.
2230 university students.
Antibiotic storage was evaluated at the time of the survey, while self-medication was assessed for 1 year preceding this time. Associated factors were determined via multivariable logistic regression models.
Among 2230 participants, 418 (18.7%) reported self-medicating with antibiotics. The three main reasons for this behaviour included saving time (48.6%), mild diseases (45.0%) and the ease of purchasing antibiotics from community pharmacies (43.8%). Community pharmacies (88.3%) and home storage (36.4%) were the primary sources of antibiotics for self-treatment. Students mainly selected antibiotics based on community pharmacists' consultation (59.8%) and their knowledge/experience (37.8%). They commonly read the patient information leaflet (64.6%) and asked for the community pharmacist's advice to obtain information about antibiotic usage (52.9%). Besides, 296 students (13.3%) stored antibiotics at home. Over two-thirds had antibiotic leftovers from previous treatment and stored them for future use (69.3%), while 46.3% purchased antibiotics from community pharmacies without a prescription. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was the most commonly used antibiotic for self-medication (59.8%) and home storage (54.4%). Antibiotic self-medication was significantly associated with older age (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=1.25; 95% CI 1.15 to 1.35), non-healthcare students (aOR=0.47; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.63), higher knowledge score (aOR=1.05; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.07) and storing antibiotics at home (aOR=7.12; 95% CI 5.34 to 9.51). Factors associated with home storage of antibiotics included non-healthcare students (aOR=2.77; 95% CI 2.01 to 3.83), region (north: aOR=6.50; 95% CI 3.49 to 13.54; south: aOR=5.92; 95% CI 3.06 to 12.65), having a family member working in the medical field (aOR=1.70; 95% CI 1.29 to 2.25), higher knowledge score (aOR=1.05; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.08) and antibiotic self-medication (aOR=7.58; 95% CI 5.69 to 10.14) (p values<0.001).
The prevalence of antibiotic self-medication and home storage among students was relatively low but still raises public health concerns. Some interventions, such as integrating targeted health education programmes into university curricula, orientation sessions, extracurricular activities and campus campaigns, may help effectively promote rational antibiotic use.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41161830

Single centre, double blind, placebo controlled randomised trial.
One university hospital in the Capital Region of Denmark. Participants were enrolled between March and December 2023. All initial clinical consultations were conducted between March 2023 and January 2024, and all long term follow-up consultations were conducted between March and November 2024. This article reports only data from the first consultation.
442 women with episiotomies or second degree tears were consecutively recruited at delivery. Exclusion criteria included treatment allergy (or risk of cross reactivity with related antibiotics), antibiotic use within 24 hours of delivery, non-Danish speakers, caesarean section, or episiotomy extension.
A computer generated program randomised participants to either three doses of amoxicillin (500 mg) with clavulanic acid (125 mg) or placebo starting within six hours post partum and repeated at eight hour intervals. Follow-up was conducted four to 14 days post partum. Physicians, the steering committee, and participants were blinded.
Wound complications (primary outcome) and clinically relevant wound complications (secondary outcome).
The study ended as planned, in December 2024. 433 women completed follow-up and were included in the primary analysis. No significant difference was observed in overall wound complications (antibiotic 47/218, 22%; placebo 62/215, 29%; P=0.10), with a risk difference of -7.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) -15.4% to 0.8%) and a relative risk of 0.75 (0.54 to 1.04). For clinically relevant wound complications, significantly fewer events occurred in the treatment group (19/218, 9% 
Although no significant effect was seen for overall wound complications, prophylactic antibiotics significantly reduced the risk of clinically relevant wound complications in women with episiotomies and second degree tears and should be considered in postpartum care.

This article aims to critically evaluate and debunk several widespread myths in infectious disease management that lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Through a nonsystematic literature review, this manuscript examines key misconceptions across various aspects of antimicrobial therapy, including administration routes, drug mechanisms, treatment duration, and the interplay with infection source control. It also explores the influence of evolving concepts like long-acting antimicrobials and the human microbiome. We challenge the dogmas that intravenous antibiotics are superior to oral agents, that longer courses are always better, and that bactericidal drugs are more effective than bacteriostatic ones. The review highlights the paramount importance of source control and surgical intervention in treating severe infections and cautions against misinformation surrounding the human microbiome. The medical community must critically re-evaluate long-standing clinical practices to improve antibiotic stewardship. By debunking these myths, we can promote a more precise, safe, and effective approach to antimicrobial use, ultimately reducing unnecessary prescribing and combating antimicrobial resistance.
El uso subóptimo de antimicrobianos es un desafío global impulsado por dogmas e ideas erróneas arraigadas. Este artículo busca evaluar críticamente y desmentir varios mitos generalizados en el manejo de enfermedades infecciosas que conducen al sobrediagnóstico y al sobretratamiento. A través de una revisión bibliográfica no sistemática, este manuscrito examina conceptos erróneos clave en diversos aspectos de la terapia antimicrobiana, incluyendo las vías de administración, los mecanismos farmacológicos, la duración del tratamiento y su interacción con el control de la fuente de infección. También explora la influencia de conceptos en evolución como los antimicrobianos de acción prolongada y el microbioma humano. Desafiamos los dogmas de que los antibióticos intravenosos son superiores a los orales, que los tratamientos más prolongados siempre son mejores y que los fármacos bactericidas son más efectivos que los bacteriostáticos. La revisión destaca la importancia fundamental del “control del foco” y la intervención quirúrgica o instrumental en el tratamiento de infecciones graves y advierte contra la desinformación en torno al microbioma humano. La comunidad médica debe reevaluar críticamente las prácticas clínicas tradicionales para mejorar la optimización del uso de antibióticos. Al desacreditar estos mitos, podemos promover un enfoque más preciso, seguro y eficaz para el uso de antimicrobianos, reduciendo en última instancia la prescripción innecesaria y combatiendo la resistencia a los antimicrobianos.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41159234/,10.37201/req/s01.11.2025

39068790","Architecture, goals and challenges of the Swiss Information System for Antibiotics in Veterinary Medicine (IS ABV).","Schnidrig GA, Schwermer H, Heim D, Léger A, Schüpbach-Regula G",2025,JAC-antimicrobial resistance,"In-depth knowledge of antibiotic treatments in animals is essential to effectively combat antimicrobial resistance. Notably, veterinary antibiotic sales in Switzerland have dropped by >50% in the past decade. However, a further breakdown by species or detailed livestock classes such as dairy or fattening cattle has so far not been possible because products are often authorized for use in multiple species and sectors. In 2020, the Swiss national monitoring system for antibiotic use (IS ABV) was introduced, which has substantially improved the availability of detailed data on antibiotic use. The aim of this study is to provide a high-level overview of IS ABV, its technical implementation and the current state of the system, highlighting its strengths and current and past weaknesses.
To achieve this, we extracted antibiotic use data from the IS ABV surveillance system and analysed prescription-level data from 2020 to 2023, applying seasonal adjustments using ARIMA time series modelling.
We identified a significant decreasing trend in the number of prescriptions for companion and farm animals. In addition, the approximated reporting errors have decreased over time, indicating improved accuracy in documenting antibiotic use by veterinarians.
These advances highlight the system's effectiveness in improving data accuracy and in monitoring antibiotic management improvements in Swiss veterinary practices. By providing more reliable, timely data, IS ABV enables better monitoring of prescribing patterns and supports evidence-based decision-making. This enables the authorities to design targeted interventions and policies aimed at reducing unnecessary antibiotic use, thereby contributing to the fight against antimicrobial resistance.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41159098

40503455",Antimicrobial Resistance: A Rising Global Threat to Public Health.,"Patra M, Gupta AK, Kumar D, Kumar B",2025,Infection and drug resistance,"The discovery of penicillin marked a revolutionary step in modern medicine, leading to the development of various chemotherapeutic agents that transformed the treatment of life-threatening diseases. However, the accelerating emergence of antimicrobial resistance poses a formidable global threat to public health, fueled by the indiscriminate use of antibiotics across various fields such as the health sector, agriculture, vet medication, etc. This review outlines the possible mechanism of resistance development in various pathogens such as efflux pumps, biofilm formation, downregulation of receptors, and mutation under species selection pressure. It addresses the role of the environment, that is often overlooked in the circulation of antibiotic remnants through animal waste, soil, the food chain, and the gene exchange process. The One Health framework integrates health with multidisciplinary surveillance and intervention strategies for an effective check on the phenomenon of antimicrobial resistance. Various current strategies have been considered, taking from antimicrobial stewardship to public awareness for addressing the current problem. There are various alternatives to conventional antibiotics discussed that can potentially minimise their usage and mitigate reliance on antimicrobial agents. This article provides a comprehensive overview to address the current issue with possible strategies and support future research to tackle AMR.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41158783

25980353",A Novel PCR Panel for Bacterial Detection in Lower Respiratory Tract Infections: A Comparative Study with Culture Results.,"Kömeç S, Durmuş MA, Ceylan AN, Korkusuz R",2025,"Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)","Lower respiratory tract (LRT) infections require rapid and accurate diagnosis. While bacterial culture remains the gold standard, multiplex PCR (mPCR) enables faster and more sensitive detection of multiple pathogens. This study evaluates the Bio-Speedy mPCR panel for 18 bacteria in comparison to conventional culture. A total of 100 LRT samples were analyzed. Complete concordance between the methods was observed in 85% of samples, with mPCR detecting pathogens slightly more frequently (62% vs. 53%). Discrepancies were primarily due to prior antibiotic therapy, low bacterial loads, colonization, or pathogens not included in the PCR panel. The sensitivity and specificity of mPCR were 79.3% and 96.8%, respectively, with negative agreement at 98.9% and positive agreement at 57.0%. Considering culture-negative but clinically relevant PCR-positive results, the sensitivity improved to 98.1% and the positive agreement to 86.7%. mPCR offers early pathogen detection, enabling timely therapy and potentially improving outcomes, particularly in intensive care settings. While culture remains indispensable for viable pathogen identification, combining mPCR with conventional methods provides complementary information, particularly when prior antibiotic use or the presence of fastidious pathogens may compromise culture results. Careful consideration of cost, patient population, and clinical context is recommended for optimal implementation of mPCR panels.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41156628

We aim to assess the effect of prefilled order sentences on guideline-compliant prescribing.Prospective observational study featuring introduction of prefilled order sentences relating to community-acquired pneumonia. To assess guideline compliance based on the CURB-65 score, a scoring tool was used to assess the severity of community-acquired pneumonia. A study period of 6 months was chosen based on a sample size of 164 records with power of 80% to detect a 20% change in admissions that had guideline-compliant prescribing.The intervention was implemented on February 28, 2023, and data were extracted 6 months before and 6 months after. A total of 11,682 prescriptions were identified before the intervention, and 14,726 after the intervention. After screening and review, this corresponded to 75 and 53 eligible admissions before and after the intervention, which was lower than the anticipated sample size. The mean age of patients was 76.6 years old (sd. 17.3, range 24-97 years). There was a significant difference between before and after samples in the presence of confusion (17.3% before, and 37.7% after; ","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41151781

28616464",Participatory process to design community-driven solutions for reducing antibiotic use in chicken production in Vietnam.,"Bâtie C, Nam LH, Phuong AT, Pham TT, Molia S, Duc PP, Goutard F",2025,PloS one,"International organizations emphasize the urgent need to reduce antibiotic use to combat antimicrobial resistance, including in livestock farming. Technical, regulatory, and awareness-raising strategies exist, but they often fail due to a misalignment with farmers' realities. We hypothesize that actively engaging communities in the design of solutions will more effectively reduce antibiotic usage. We have therefore adapted and applied the ImpresS ex ante approach (impact of research in the South), to co-design solutions with stakeholders from the chicken and veterinary value chain at a local level in Vietnam. Eighteen participants (chicken farmers, drug sellers' representatives, public and private veterinarians, a chicken retailer, and academic staff), working at the communal, district, or provincial level, were involved in three half-day workshops organized in Thai Nguyen province in April 2022. Through this participatory process, participants collectively envisioned a 10-year future with reduced antibiotic use in chicken farms. They identified barriers including the lack of outlets for organic meat products, lack of knowledge and awareness of biosecurity and organic farming, low compliance of small-scale farms with biosecurity, and lack of science and technology related to alternative products. Participants decided to address ""knowledge gaps"" barrier. They have designed two strategies to improve the training of farmers and drug sellers, so that it is closer to the chicken value chain realities and reaches a greater audience. In this study, we identify systemic barriers to reducing antibiotic use, while recommending practical solutions. We also advocate the need to include locally-developed solutions in the national action plan on antimicrobial resistance in Vietnam and to involve policy-makers in participatory processes to design effective strategies.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41150663

39299011",Next-Generation Sequencing Reveals Field Strain Dynamics and PRRSV-2 Clearance in Gilts When Using Tylvalosin During MLV Vaccination.,"Wu W, Gao X, Gao J, Lai Z, Deng X, Zhang J, Zhou Q, Zhou L",2025,Vaccines,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes significant economic losses for the global swine industry. Gilt immunization using modified live virus (MLV) vaccines is crucial for herd stability, but it is complicated by frequent mixed infections of PRRSV strains on farm. This study monitored the administration of tylvalosin during a PRRSV-2 MLV (TJM) immunization program, focusing on viral dynamics and immune responses in gilts naturally exposed to co-circulating classical (GD240101) and highly pathogenic like (HP-PRRSV-like, GD240102) PRRSV strains.
The animal study was approved by the Laboratory Animal Ethical Committee of China Agricultural University. One hundred gilts were randomized into control and tylvalosin groups (
In this field trial where tylvalosin was used, a shorter duration of PRRSV viremia and saliva shedding was observed to compare with controls. NGS analysis showed accelerated vaccine strain (TJM) clearance in the tylvalosin group (by week 3 vs. week 9 in control). Field strain dynamics were also altered, showing a faster decline in the tylvalosin group. Antibody response uniformity was altered, with lower coefficient of variation (CV) for PRRSV and CSFV observed following tylvalosin usage.
In gilts receiving tylvalosin for the management of bacterial pathogens during a PRRSV MLV immunization program, it was associated with accelerated viral clearance and enhanced systemic immune response uniformity under mixed-infection field conditions. NGS provides invaluable data for dissecting these complex viral dynamics. Crucially, these findings describe a biological drug-host-virus interaction and should not be interpreted as an endorsement for the prophylactic use of antimicrobials. In alignment with global antimicrobial stewardship principles, tylvalosin should be reserved for the therapeutic treatment of diagnosed bacterial diseases to mitigate the risk of promoting resistance.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41150395

35271460",Veterinarians' Perspectives on the Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Dashboard: A Survey of Needs and Preferences to Inform Development.,"Pellissery AJ, Denagamage T, Pedersen M, Kariyawasam S",2025,Veterinary sciences,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant global threat to human and animal health, necessitating robust surveillance and stewardship tools. While existing systems address aspects of veterinary AMR, a comprehensive, user-centric dashboard for U.S. veterinarians remains a critical unmet need. This study aimed to identify U.S. veterinarians' preferences and perceived needs for such a dashboard, to help guide its design and development. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between January and March 2024, targeting U.S. veterinarians through professional channels. The survey instrument captured demographics, experiences with existing tools, preferences for data types and visualizations, desired technical specifications, and open-ended feedback. Of the 677 respondents, a near-unanimous consensus (over 75%) emerged on the importance of functionalities like antimicrobial stewardship education, off-label use guidance, surveillance data, and empirical treatment support. Over 70% expressed comfort sharing aggregated geographic and de-identified animal data. A strong preference was observed for making the dashboard accessible by veterinary colleges (78.87%), diagnostic laboratories (72.61%), and federal agencies (USDA: 71.47%, CDC: 66.67%, FDA: 62.11%), indicating a desire for a collaborative, authoritative system. The findings provide a robust foundation for developing a U.S. veterinary AMR dashboard. Future phases should adopt an iterative, user-centered design, incorporating qualitative research with diverse stakeholders and piloting a prototype with preferred institutional partners. This approach will ensure a trusted, sustainable tool that effectively translates surveillance data into actionable insights for improved animal and public health.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41150080

Pediatric antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) face implementation challenges, often relying on adult-based guidelines and limited pediatric-specific evidence. This study aimed to identify and prioritize the most critical areas for pediatric ASP intervention development through a structured, multi-round Delphi consensus process with experts in antimicrobial stewardship and infectious diseases.
A four-round modified Delphi process was conducted to identify and prioritize key pediatric ASP interventions. Experts in antimicrobial stewardship and infectious diseases were recruited through an existing clinical trial. Using an iterative survey and in-person discussions, experts provided input on priority areas, which were thematically grouped and refined across rounds. Structured feedback supported real-time refinement and consensus-building.
Twenty experts participated in the process, generating 25 priority items in Round 1 through open-ended responses. These were narrowed to seven key priorities through structured voting and discussion. The final items were clustered into three intersecting themes: Care Settings, Prescriptions, and Strategies. Care Settings focused on high-impact areas such as outpatient clinics and intensive care units, where misuse is common and/or care is complex. The prescriptions theme prioritized shorter durations and narrow-spectrum agents. The strategy theme highlighted the need for outcome-based metrics, improved diagnostic stewardship, and routine tracking of patient outcomes to guide and assess stewardship efforts.
This expert consensus identified key priorities for pediatric ASPs, providing a foundation for future interventions. Findings can be used to inform policy and practice, improving the appropriate use of antimicrobials in pediatrics and combating AMR.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41148702

36141534",Impact of Antimicrobial-Resistant Bacterial Pneumonia on In-Hospital Mortality and Length of Hospital Stay: A Retrospective Cohort Study in Spain.,"Oterino-Moreira I, Pérez-Encinas M, Candel-González FJ, Lorenzo-Martínez S",2025,"Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)","Antimicrobial resistance is a major global health threat. This study aimed to assess the impact of antimicrobial-resistant bacterial pneumonia on in-hospital mortality and length of hospital stay in Spain using a large, nationally representative cohort.
A retrospective cohort study that used data from Spain's Registry of Specialized Health Care Activity (RAE-CMBD) between 2017 and 2022. Hospitalized adults with bacterial pneumonia were included. Hospitalization episodes with bacterial antimicrobial resistance, defined according to ICD-10-CM codes for antimicrobial resistance (Z16.1, Z16.2), were analyzed versus hospitalization episodes without these codes. Multivariate logistic regression models, adjusted for potential confounders (e.g., age, comorbidity, intensive care unit admission) and sensitivity analyses (Poisson regression and propensity score matching test), were performed.
Of the 116,901 eligible hospitalizations, 6017 (5.15%) involved antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Patients with antimicrobial-resistant bacterial pneumonia were older (median 75 vs. 72 years), had greater comorbidity (Elixhauser-van Walraven index: 8 vs. 5), and were more frequently admitted to the intensive care unit (22% vs. 14%). Crude in-hospital mortality was higher in the antimicrobial resistance group (18.46% vs. 10.05%, 
Antimicrobial resistance is associated with longer hospital stays and an up to 50% higher risk of mortality. Despite the implementation of control policies in place over the past decade, policymakers must strengthen AMR surveillance and ensure adequate resource allocation. Clinicians, in turn, must reinforce antimicrobial stewardship and incorporate rapid diagnostic tools to minimize the impact of antimicrobial resistance on patient outcomes.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41148697

31338161",Frequency and antimicrobial resistance pattern of non lactose fermenting gram negative rods in neurosurgical patients outlining aminoglycoside resistance genes.,"Gaber SN, Abdullah AA, Osman AA, Khalil MAF, Ali ESG",2025,BMC microbiology,"Non-Fermenting Gram-Negative Rods (NFGNRs) are one of the major causes of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) with high levels of antibiotic resistance. The patients following neurosurgery are continuously at risk of HAIs due to the severity of the brain insult. We aimed to assess the frequency and the characterization of antimicrobial resistance patterns among NFGNR-causing HAIs isolated from neurosurgical patients with special reference to the aminoglycoside resistance.
A cross-sectional study was conducted on the hospitalized neurosurgical patients at Fayoum University Surgical Hospital, Egypt. The demographic characteristics and clinical data of patients were reported. The HAI definition was used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). From 120 patients, one hundred and thirty-one samples were obtained and cultured on an appropriate media. NLFGNRs were identified using standard microbiological methods and VITEK2. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was evaluated using the disc diffusion method. PCR was used to detect the aminoglycosides-resistant genes. Simple descriptive statistical analysis for results was done using statistical software, SPSS version 24. The chi-square and Fisher's exact test for the bivariate relationship were performed.
One hundred and forty-six strains were isolated. NFGNRs represented [63/146 (43.1%)]. The most frequent NFGNRs were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) (66.7%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) (33.3%). 63.5% of NFGNR were resistant to aminoglycosides. P. aeruginosa exhibited a higher rate of resistance to gentamicin (62%), amikacin (59.5%), and meropenem (57.1%). In addition, A. baumannii was resistant to gentamicin (76.1%), amikacin (62%), and meropenem, ceftazidime (57.1%) for both. armA gene was the most detected aminoglycoside resistance gene (97.7%), followed by aac(3')-IIa (59.1%).
We reported a high prevalence of NFGNRs (43.1%) causing HAIs among neurosurgical patients with increased antibiotic resistance for gentamicin. This makes a significant challenge for continued surveillance of antibiotic resistance and the improvement of the antimicrobial stewardship program to lower the frequency of NFGNR infections among neurosurgical patients.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41146018

33072690",Involvement of community health workers in antimicrobial stewardship interventions and programmes: a scoping review.,"Castro-Sánchez E, Huguet-Torres A, Yáñez-Juan AM, Bennasar-Veny M",2025,BMJ global health,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a global health threat, especially in low-income and middle-income countries. Community health workers (CHWs) are key actors in infection management and health promotion; however, their involvement in antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) remains unclear. This study aims to assess CHWs' roles in AMS, examine their training and support, and evaluate outcomes regarding antibiotic use and resistance.
A scoping review was conducted to explore the roles, education, training and antimicrobial-related outcomes of CHWs. The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines, with the protocol registered in Open Science Framework. Databases including PubMed, EMBASE and CINAHL were searched for studies published in English and Spanish. A narrative synthesis was applied to the identified articles, with the Integrated Quality Criteria for the Review of Multiple Study Designs and Quality Assessment Tool for Studies with Diverse Designs tools employed to assess the risk of bias.
Eight studies were identified, conducted in Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Kenya. CHWs were involved in various AMS activities, such as infection prevention, detection and treatment of conditions such as pneumonia and gastrointestinal infections. CHWs contributed to health education, antibiotic prescription (when authorised) and improved adherence to guidelines. Positive outcomes included reduced inappropriate antibiotic use and increased community awareness of AMR. However, the effectiveness of these interventions varied depending on the local context and resources.
CHWs play an important role in promoting responsible antibiotic use and addressing AMR, particularly in underserved settings. Strengthening their training, expanding selected roles and responsibilities and improving support mechanisms should be considered to enhance their potential contribution to AMS programmes. Further research is needed to optimise CHW interventions and evaluate their long-term impact.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41145199

41144232,Cytomegalovirus antiviral stewardship considerations in solid organ transplant patients.,"Kleiboeker HL, Jorgenson MR",2025,Expert review of anti-infective therapy,"There is a growing acknowledgment of the importance of stewardship initiatives in solid organ transplant given the increased potential for morbidity and mortality. Antiviral stewardship, particularly as it pertains to cytomegalovirus (CMV), has been most extensively studied.
This review outlines the history and development of stewardship interventions in the solid organ transplant population with a focus on antiviral stewardship of CMV. Obstacles and proposed solutions to these obstacles from the vantage point of the UW Health experience are shared. Proposed future applications of the antiviral stewardship framework and structure are discussed. A systematic review of English language studies published since 2000 was performed. Search terms included solid organ transplant, antimicrobial stewardship, antiviral stewardship, post-transplant viral infections, and cytomegalovirus.
Antimicrobial stewardship has a role in the immunocompromised host, and CMV antiviral stewardship is a unique application in solid organ transplant. Utilization of this initiative can improve outcomes related to CMV, particularly in the high-risk population providing a proactive, dedicated effort with a well-established infrastructure for effective surveillance after prophylaxis. Targeted quality improvement initiatives can further personalize the initiative to address issues unique to each transplant center. Large scale or all-encompassing efforts are not required to obtain substantial benefit.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41144232/,10.1080/14787210.2025.2579205

The Arwain complex intervention within Wales established peer networks of 'Veterinary Prescribing Champions' (VPCs) within and between Welsh veterinary practices to facilitate AMS training, support and activity. This study evaluates AMS goal setting and implementation within continuously engaged Arwain veterinary practices (
Descriptive quantitative analysis of Practice Action Plans (2020, 2024) and self-reported data on Action Plan implementation (2024), combined with qualitative analysis of participant interviews (2023) and participatory workshop feedback (2024) on challenges to implementing change, offer insight on the focus, achievements and implementation of AMS within the Arwain complex intervention.
VPCs focused on behaviour-led (practice team/farm client) and structural (farm/practice-focused) changes. All practices reported at least one change goal initiated, with the majority (73%) reporting at least one fully implemented change. AMS implementation challenges included practical and cultural considerations of veterinary practices, the complexities of delivering AMS within inter-professional teams, the situated complexity of AMS on farm and the geographic, economic, regulatory, epidemiological and attitudinal factors implicit in the practice 'outer setting'.
The Arwain complex intervention led to successful implementation of AMS changes across participating practices, with varying complexity, abstractness and completeness. Further research into the impact on antimicrobial use is needed to evaluate and inform future policy.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41143081

Incidence rates of SSI are high in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with evidence of surge in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in these regions. This mini review aimed to collect and analyze existing data on SSI incidence and the associated AMR in LMICs to address some concerns about causes and control strategies.
MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, AMED, Biosis, and CINAHL were all searched for this study until June 8, 2025. We included all studies comparing disparities in surgical site infections and related antimicrobial resistance in low- and middle-income countries.
The overall SSI incidence in LMICs is higher than in high-income countries . The intertwined relationship between SSI and the rising AMR burden further complicates the issue. The emergence of AMR is driven by inappropriate antibiotic use, poor regulatory oversight and stewardship, inadequate healthcare infrastructure, economic limitations that result in incomplete or informal treatments, weak surveillance systems, and environmental contamination from hospitals, agriculture, and wastewater. Vaccination, sanitation and hygiene, infection control, education, alternative therapies consideration of, antimicrobial stewardship, and prevention, are strategies to prevent and reduce the development of AMR.
AMR is a dire global problem that requires immediate action to combat its spread. Effective AMR surveillance from a ""One Health"" viewpoint is needed in LMICs to map and track the spread of resistance. Environmental resistome sample is required to detect the factors influencing resistance. Searching for solution to colistin resistance, a last resort antibiotic, is critical.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41142666

Despite the availability of national guidelines, adherence among physicians in Lebanon was previously unclear.
To evaluate the appropriateness of empiric antibiotic prescribing for hospitalized CAP patients in Lebanon and identify factors associated with non-compliance with national guidelines.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in five Lebanese hospitals across various regions. Medical records of 380 adult CAP patients were reviewed. Empiric antibiotic regimens were evaluated for compliance with national CAP guidelines based on drug selection, dosage, route, and duration. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of inappropriate prescribing.
Only 38.9 % of patients received fully guideline-concordant empiric therapy. Inappropriate prescribing was significantly associated with physician rank (residents: aOR = 29.13,

39103907","Awareness of Antibiotic Resistance Among Medical Professionals in Kerala, India: A Cross-Sectional Study.","Kuttikkunnummal AS, Sivan SP, Divakaran D, Salahudeen M, Vijay P, Theruvinkattil HJ, Usman SA",2025,Cureus,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as a critical global health threat, undermining the effective treatment of infectious diseases. The growing challenge of antibiotic resistance is a matter of concern, driven by frequent misuse of antimicrobial agents and limited awareness among healthcare professionals. This study aimed to assess the level of antibiotic resistance awareness across diverse medical professionals in Kerala, India, and to identify demographic and contextual influences that affect awareness and stewardship practices.
A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 345 healthcare professionals, including doctors, dentists, nurses, and pharmacists across Kerala. Participants completed a validated 23-item Antibiotic Resistance Awareness Scale, supplemented with modules on demographics, formal training, and workplace factors. Data were analyzed to evaluate predictors of awareness scores.
Participants demonstrated moderate to high overall AMR awareness (mean score 73.9 ± 10.5), with the highest scores among physicians (75.8) and the lowest among nurses (69.7, p < 0.001). Significant disparities were observed by profession, training level, and practice setting. Only 23.5% reported formal AMR training, with pharmacists showing the highest training participation (44%). Males scored higher than females (mean difference 2.3, p=0.046), and practitioners in tertiary care had superior knowledge compared to those in primary care (mean difference 3.4, p=0.008). Training participation showed a positive but nonsignificant association with awareness (p=0.074).
While overall awareness of antibiotic resistance among Kerala's healthcare professionals was good, substantial disparities exist, especially among nurses and those lacking formal AMR training. These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted educational programs, integrated stewardship curricula, and resource strengthening. Addressing these gaps is essential for successful AMR mitigation and for informing future policy and curricular reforms locally and in similar contexts globally.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41141885

38996086",Emerging Role of Emergency Physicians in Antimicrobial Stewardship.,Taniguchi H,2025,Cureus,"The emergency department (ED) is increasingly recognized as a critical site for antimicrobial stewardship, where most initial antibiotic decisions occur, and emergency physicians (EPs), previously regarded as primarily focused on empiric treatment, are now emerging as leaders. Policy milestones, including accreditation standards and national guidelines, have catalyzed this transition, yet physician roles remain heterogeneous, and evidence on long-term outcomes is limited. Drawing on English-language literature, including intervention studies, descriptive reports, and policy documents, this editorial highlights how EPs contribute through guideline development, audit and feedback, culture follow-up, formulary oversight, rapid diagnostics, and educational initiatives. Evidence consistently shows improvements in prescribing appropriateness, reduced use of broad-spectrum agents, and faster optimization without compromising safety. However, barriers such as time pressure, professional culture, role ambiguity, and limited resources remain persistent. Importantly, the leadership of EPs has proven central in overcoming these obstacles, especially when supported by institutional commitment and integrated workflows. Their engagement is not only improving immediate prescribing practices but also represents a critical frontline defense against antimicrobial resistance and multidrug-resistant organisms. Looking forward, formalizing physician leadership, embedding stewardship in emergency medicine training, and building ED-specific data systems are essential to sustain safe and effective antibiotic use.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41141168

40416068",From Womb to Tomb: A Life-Course Perspective on the Origins of Non-communicable Diseases.,"Dev A, Patra R, Kale SA, James Marianadin LP, Mohanty SS, Benny J",2025,Cureus,"Chronic illnesses such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory disorders are leading causes of death globally. Although often considered adult-onset, growing evidence links their origins to early developmental exposures, including prenatal, neonatal, and early childhood stages. This review adopts a life-course perspective to examine how factors such as maternal undernutrition, gestational diabetes, low birth weight, early antibiotic use, suboptimal infant feeding, adverse childhood experiences, and childhood obesity influence long-term disease risk through mechanisms like epigenetic modifications, immune and hormonal programming, and metabolic changes. The window from conception through the first two years is especially critical for physiological programming. Evidence from cohort studies supports these associations, though findings are primarily drawn from high-income countries, limiting generalizability to more vulnerable settings. Despite awareness of early-life influence, most prevention remains adult-focused. There is a need for intergenerational strategies spanning preconception to early childhood, alongside school-based interventions and population-level policies. Mobile health technologies and personalized risk profiling offer scalable, cost-effective approaches to early intervention, particularly in underserved communities. The ""womb-to-tomb"" model emphasizes the urgency of investing in early health to achieve sustainable, equitable prevention of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) throughout life.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41141052

31866215",Optimizing Rigid Cystoscopy and Biopsy Requests for Red Patches After Flexible Cystoscopy: A Two‑Cycle Quality Improvement Audit.,"Hossain A, Albnhawy ATAM, Dhariwal R, Abdalla M, Papikinos P",2025,Cureus,"Background Flat erythematous ""red patches"" (RPs) identified during flexible cystoscopy are common and often benign, yet they have historically prompted rigid cystoscopy and biopsy under general anesthesia. This practice can lead to unnecessary procedures with low diagnostic yield, added morbidity, and increased healthcare burden. Objective To evaluate the local practice regarding rigid cystoscopy and biopsy for RPs and to assess the impact of a targeted departmental intervention. Methods This was a single-center, retrospective, two-cycle quality improvement audit at a UK district general hospital. Cycle 1 included all flexible cystoscopies between March and June 2024 and Cycle 2 between November 2024 and February 2025. Data collected included demographics, cystoscopy indication, smoking history, urinary tract infection (UTI) status, biopsy decisions, histology, antibiotic use, and relook outcomes. Following Cycle 1, an intervention was introduced comprising mandatory red-patch image capture, consultant review prior to biopsy listing, and structured teaching on morphology, risk stratification, and benign mimics. Results In Cycle 1, 63 RP cases were identified; 37 (58.7%) underwent biopsy, with three malignancies detected (8.1%). Relook cystoscopy was performed in 26 patients, with resolution in 20 (76.9%); of six persistent cases, three underwent biopsy (one malignancy) and three were observed safely. In Cycle 2, 73 cases were identified; 23 (31.5%) underwent biopsy, with one malignancy (4.3%). Relook was performed in 48 patients, with resolution in 32 (66.7%); of 16 persistent cases, eight underwent biopsy (one malignancy) and eight were managed conservatively. Across both cycles, all malignancies occurred in patients >60 years; three of four had a smoking history, and one coincided with proven UTI. Antibiotic prescribing remained frequent, including in patients without culture-proven infection.  Conclusion In our center, a consultant-led, image-supported, risk-stratified pathway appeared to reduce unnecessary rigid cystoscopy and biopsy requests for RPs, with no observed delays in cancer detection during the audit period. Most lesions resolved spontaneously or after UTI treatment, and several persistent but low-risk patches were managed safely without biopsy. However, with only four malignant cases identified, oncological safety cannot be definitively established, and these findings should be regarded as exploratory. This study is further limited by its single-center, retrospective design and small event rate. Future work should prioritize antibiotic stewardship, standardization of relook intervals, and evaluation of urine cytology in high-risk patients.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41141034

Between April-December 2024, 182 pregnant women without urinary tract infection symptoms were screened at Kırşehir Training and Research Hospital. Midstream urine samples were cultured, and bacterial isolates were identified and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using the BD Phoenix™ automated system. Data were interpreted according to EUCAST 2024 criteria.
ASB prevalence was 37.36%. 
ASB prevalence during second half of pregnancy was high, and a significant proportion of pathogens demonstrated MDR. The findings highlight the necessity of culture-based diagnosis and region-specific empirical therapy. High resistance to ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole suggests that empirical protocols should be updated according to local antibiograms. Strengthening antibiotic stewardship and expanding routine ASB screening are critical to reducing maternal-fetal complications.

This is a growing concern in the intensive care unit (ICU), particularly in regard to antibiotics.
The aim of this study was to explore clinicians' awareness of RDE, its perceived causes, and potential strategies to reduce its occurrence.
A qualitative approach using focus groups was conducted with ICU nurses, examining their awareness of RDE, contributing factors, and ideas for prevention. Thematic analysis was used to identify key themes and subthemes from the data.
Twenty-seven participants participated in four focus groups over four mandatory training days. Clinicians' experiences with RDEs in the ICU were categorised into three main themes: (i) Awareness and perception of RDEs; (ii) Potential causes of RDE, including knowledge gaps, workload pressures, and inconsistent double-checking and documentation practices; and (iii) Proposed solutions to minimise RDEs including enhanced education, standardised protocols, and improved documentation.
ICU nurses demonstrated limited prior awareness of RDE, with participants identifying multiple contributing factors including personal practice variability, drug characteristics, workload pressures, and reconstitution technique. Proposed solutions centred on targeted education, consistent double-checking and signing procedures, and concise, accessible checklists. These findings can inform the development of practical, context-appropriate strategies to improve medication accuracy and patient safety in the ICU.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41138520/,10.1016/j.aucc.2025.101450

The study objective was to assess the impact of a shortened antibacterial surgical prophylaxis duration on post-operative acute kidney injury (AKI) in lung transplant recipients.
This was an IRB approved, single pre-/post-test quasi-experiment of lung transplant recipients who received post-operative antibiotic prophylaxis from January 1, 2016-September 30, 2020 (pre-group) to October 1, 2020-March 31, 2025 (post-group). The intervention included modifying vancomycin (and cefepime) post-operative prophylaxis durations to 72 h; the previous prophylaxis standard included continuing vancomycin until chest tube removal. The primary endpoint was incidence of AKI, defined by the KDIGO criteria, while receiving post-operative vancomycin up to 14 days. Thirty-day secondary outcomes included surgical site infection (SSI), treatment of lower respiratory-tract infection, and isolation of multi-drug-resistant organisms (MDRO).
Ninety patients were included-45 pre- and 45 post-intervention. Most patients were men (64.4%) and had a median (IQR) age of 63 (58-68) years. The most common indication for transplant was pulmonary fibrosis (37.8%). The incidence of 14-day AKI was reduced when comparing pre- and post-intervention groups (48.9% vs. 28.9%, p = 0.052), with no differences in SSI (2.2% vs. 2.2%, p = 1.0), treatment of lower respiratory tract infection (57.8% vs. 73.3%, p = 0.120), and isolation of MDRO (15.6% vs. 13.3%, p = 0.764). When accounting for baseline renal function, patients in the post-intervention group had a significantly decreased odds of AKI (adjOR, 0.385; 95%CI, 0.154-0.959).
Implementation of a shortened post-operative vancomycin prophylaxis duration protocol was associated with reduced odds of AKI in lung transplant recipients, with similar post-operative infectious complications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41138064/,10.1111/tid.70118

Overuse and inappropriate prescription of antifungal (AF) agents have been reported in pediatrics, leading not only to an increase in adverse events and toxicities but also to the development of AF resistance. AF stewardship practices as part of broader antimicrobial stewardship programs are crucial for improving outcomes and reducing AF overuse and associated costs. This review has two main objectives: to summarize the published data on prescription patterns of AF agents in pediatrics and to describe the current state of pediatric AF stewardship programs worldwide, providing suggestions for their implementation.

31142607",Current Evidence and Gaps for Outpatient Respiratory Tract Infection Diagnostics: A Call to Action.,"Arena CJ, Frost HM, Willis P, Raux B, Wungwattana M, Veve MP",2025,Open forum infectious diseases,"Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are underrepresented in outpatient settings, where antibiotic use and overprescribing are common. Upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) account for 30% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions, highlighting the need for enhanced ASP efforts. Rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) has important value in management of outpatient URIs, such as pharyngitis, and can lead to optimized prescribing practices and significant reductions in unnecessary antimicrobial use by facilitating accurate diagnoses. Implementation of outpatient RDTs is hindered by a lack of streamlined workflows, resources, and ASPs. These gaps often lead to suboptimal use of RDTs and misinterpretation of or failure to act on the results. Future RDT evaluations should include strategies to curtail unnecessary antibiotics and expand point-of-care testing (POCT) to additional settings to enhance antimicrobial stewardship. This paper reviews outpatient RDT initiatives, and specifically POCT, in URIs. Additionally, we highlight the need for more evidence demonstrating the impact on clinical outcomes and antibiotic prescribing with the implementation of RDTs.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41132513

In Palestine, dispensing antibiotics without prescription remains common despite legal restrictions, but limited qualitative evidence exists on pharmacists' perspectives. The objective was to explore community pharmacists' practices, perceptions, and challenges in dispensing antibiotics without prescription in Palestine.
This qualitative descriptive study used semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 14 licensed pharmacists from urban, semi-urban, and rural districts of the West Bank, conducted between January and March 2025. Purposive sampling ensured variation in gender, experience, and setting. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed thematically using Braun and Clarke's framework. Six major themes were identified.
Participants were aware of the legal prohibition but cited weak enforcement. Daily non-prescription requests were common, especially during seasonal illnesses, driven by prior positive experiences, social recommendations, and inability to afford doctor visits. Symptom-based dispensing was used in perceived 'clear cases,' influenced by customer pressure and business competition. Public misconceptions-such as believing antibiotics treat viral infections-were widespread, with frequent incomplete dosing and reuse of leftovers. Pharmacists attempted patient education but faced time and receptiveness barriers, and often experienced ethical conflict. Regulatory oversight was minimal; participants recommended stricter inspections, public awareness campaigns, and collaborative practice models.
Non-prescription antibiotic dispensing in Palestine is shaped by patient demand, economic pressures, and weak regulation. Addressing these drivers requires strengthened enforcement, targeted public education, professional training, and integration of pharmacists into AMR stewardship to safeguard public health. These findings highlight the need for actionable reforms in pharmacy practice and national policy, including stricter regulatory oversight and pharmacist-led public education, to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use and strengthen AMR containment strategies.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41132365

Inappropriate antimicrobial prescription and use exacerbate AMR. This study assesses the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) toward AMR and antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) among pharmacy healthcare workers involved in antimicrobial dispensing across 28 African countries.
An online survey was distributed to collect data on KAP from HCWs who dispense antimicrobials in African countries. Responses were scored, and a 70% cut-off mark was used to differentiate between good and poor KAP. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with good or poor KAPs.
A total of 2567 responses (40%) were received, of which 908 were from pharmacy HCWs who dispensed antibiotics in 28 countries. Of the 908 eligible respondents, 71.3% had good knowledge of AMR and AMS, 59.9% displayed good attitudes towards the burden of AMR and appropriate prescription of antimicrobials and 41.6% displayed good practices related to AMS. Patient demands and influence from pharmaceutical companies were among the factors that influenced the dispensing of antibiotics. In multivariable logistic regression, licensed pharmacists were more likely to have good knowledge of AMR than pharmacy technicians (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.78; 95% CI 1.64 to 1.93). Male dispensers were less likely to have a positive attitude towards AMR than female dispensers (aOR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.94). Moreover, dispensers affiliated with public health facilities demonstrated better AMR practices than those affiliated with private facilities. Overall, good AMR knowledge status was significantly associated with positive attitudes (χ²=97.1, p<0.001) and practices (χ²=6.5, p<0.05) of AMR.
This study revealed limited understanding of AMR among dispensers without formal pharmaceutical training and a positive association between good knowledge and positive attitudes and practices. The findings underscore the importance of providing workplace educational materials on AMR and AMS to build capacity in healthcare institutions and promote proper antibiotic dispensing.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41130744

Understanding public knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding antimicrobial use (AMU) and AMR is essential for designing effective interventions. Through this cross-sectional study, we aimed to assess the KAP related to rational AMU and AMR among Namibian adults using an online, self-administered survey.
We distributed an online questionnaire between 1 September and 17 November 2024, targeting Namibian adults aged 18 years and older, who had lived in Namibia for at least six months, were willing to participate, and were English literate. We analysed associations between sociodemographic factors and KAP scores using descriptive statistics and χ
Most of the 541 respondents were female (70%), aged 25-34 (40.5%) and had a tertiary education (91.9%). Good knowledge, attitudes, and practices were observed in 64.3%, 79.7%, and 74.9% of participants, respectively. Higher KAP scores were associated with education, employment, urban residence, and access to water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure. Misconceptions persisted across all groups, however, particularly regarding AMU in healthy animals and personal AMR risk.
While surveyed participants demonstrated generally good KAP, gaps remain. Our findings support the need for targeted AMR education campaigns and policy interventions, which need to be supported by a better understanding of the KAP of Namibian adults regarding AMU and AMR.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41129266

However, they pose significant public health risks by facilitating the transmission of zoonotic pathogens and contributing to the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). High human-animal interactions, poor hygiene, and unregulated antimicrobial use contribute to the emergence and spread of resistant microorganisms. Despite these risks, the role of open markets in the spread of zoonotic pathogens and AMR has received limited attention. Thus, this review explores the possible mechanisms by which AMR may spread in open markets, the role of microbial genetic exchanges in the emergence of new resistant strains in these settings, and the zoonotic risks associated with the live animal trade. It also discusses strategies and future directions to mitigate these issues, emphasizing the urgency of taking the required One Health actions to minimize the spread of AMR and the zoonotic infections globally. These actions should include robust surveillance, regulatory measures, public health initiatives along with advocacy and training, all crucial for protecting global health.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41127627

However, excessive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics should be avoided. Implementing antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) in haematology units is challenging due to high infection-related risks, and data on interventions remain scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the safety of an AMS bundle on a haematology ward.
A prospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary care centre among patients with high-risk (≥7 days) neutropenia. The AMS bundle consisted of replacing empirical meropenem with ceftazidime, and shortening treatment duration to 2 days in case of defervescence and negative blood cultures. Data on ICU admission, all-cause mortality, antimicrobial use and microorganisms identified were compared with a (retrospective) pre-intervention cohort.
A total of 396 patients were included (206 pre-intervention, 190 post-intervention). Allogeneic stem cell transplantations increased from 21% pre-intervention to 37% post-intervention. There was no statistical difference in the adjusted composite endpoint of ICU admission and all-cause mortality [adjusted HR (aHR) 1.46; 95% CI, 0.76-2.81; 
The AMS bundle led to a shift towards narrower-spectrum antibiotics, and reduced treatment duration and overall antibiotic use without a significant impact on the primary safety outcome. The intervention was accompanied by a declining trend in candidaemia incidence.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41127443

Secondary objectives were to determine whether certain timing factors and other independent variables impacted prescription appropriateness.
Single center, retrospective cohort study.
The University of Alberta Hospital a 700-bed tertiary care hospital in Edmonton, Canada.
Prescriptions of six health-authority restricted antibiotics subject to ASP PAF between 2018 and 2023. Cases were excluded if prescriber role or prescription dates or times were unavailable.
Data from a local ASP quality improvement database was extracted. Multiple logistic regression analysis was completed with adjusted odds ratios (aOR) reported.
A total of 3,687 restricted antibiotic prescriptions subjected to PAF were included in this study, of which 1,163 (31.5%) were assessed as not appropriately prescribed. Prescriptions written by medical trainees did not have higher odds of appropriateness compared to staff (aOR 1.09 [95% CI 0.94-1.28], 
No differences were noted in restricted antibiotic prescription appropriateness between medical trainees and staff. Weekend prescriptions were less likely to be appropriate. Improved appropriateness over time may be multifactorial, including implementation of ASP preceding the pandemic. Further studies examining timing factors associated with appropriateness are needed.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41127156

MUEs can explore safety concerns, high costs, or inappropriate use associated with any medication, among other factors. This can offer a valuable opportunity for Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASPs) to promote stewardship goals, which often overlap with these concerns for specific antimicrobials. MUEs can also provide an avenue to promote interdisciplinary collaboration with targeted groups relevant to the ASP's goals as well as an opportunity to give trainees ownership of system-facing stewardship projects. Stewardship pharmacists may often have experience with leading this process as part of their training, but MUEs represent a gap in training for physicians. Here we provide guidance on how stewardship physicians can engage in the MUE process, from identifying relevant topics to interpreting findings and supporting implementation efforts, allowing them to contribute effectively even without prior MUE experience.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41127150

This study aimed to determine aetiological organisms, antimicrobial resistance patterns and sepsis trend rates in paediatric inpatients from a low-and middle-income country.
A retrospective review of SS culture results of inpatients from the neonatal unit (NNU), general paediatric (GPW) and paediatric haematology-oncology wards (PHOW) at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital, South Africa, from January 2013 to December 2022.
A total of 58 053 SS specimens were submitted for analysis. Culture-positivity rate was 36.0 %, comprising 22.8 % and 13.2 % for pathogens and contaminants. Pathogen culture-positivity rate was higher in the NNU when compared to GPW (35.5 % vs 17.6 %; OR-5.38; 95 % CI 4.99-5.81) but lower than PHOW (35.5 % vs 46.6 %; OR-0.47; 95 % CI 0.39-0.52). Infection rates per 1000 patient-days increased from 1.74 in 2013 to 3.11 in 2022. Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) (66.0 % vs 18.7 %, OR-5.70; 95 % CI 5.23-6.19) and yeast (12.4 % vs 8.4 %, OR-7.66; 95 % CI 6.13-9.57) were more common in NNU than GPW. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogen prevalence was 35.1 % with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Enterobacterales contributing 40-50 %. Carbapenem-resistant 
The burden of paediatric MDR gram-negative SS infection was relatively high requiring ongoing surveillance, judicious antimicrobial use, while reinforcing infection control contact-based transmission precautions. Further studies on drivers of antimicrobial resistance such as unit specific antimicrobial consumption rates and prescriber practices, should be explored.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41126946

26115414",Pediatric necrotizing soft tissue infection: unveiling a rare complication of routine procedures - peripheral venous catheter insertion.,"Mao SH, Ho CY, Li CW, Chen CH",2025,BMC pediatrics,"Necrotizing soft-tissue infection (NSTI) is a rare yet potentially fatal condition, particularly in pediatric patients. We report the first known case of a previously healthy 1-year and 7-month-old boy who developed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) NSTI following peripheral venous catheter (PVC) insertion. The patient developed swelling and erythema at the PVC site. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) confirmed diffuse fascial inflammation consistent with NSTI, which guided the urgent decision for surgical intervention. Aggressive management with vancomycin, meropenem, and clindamycin, along with emergent, tissue-sparing surgical debridement, was initiated. The patient recovered uneventfully after 11 days, with minimal scarring and normal range of motion at 3-month follow-up. This case highlights a rare but serious complication of PVC insertion and emphasizes the need for vigilance in distinguishing between infectious and non-infectious PVC-related complications in children. The challenges in routine replacement practices, skin preparation protocols, and monitoring underscore the need for continuous improvement in clinical practices. Importantly, this case illustrates how imaging can play a decisive role in early diagnosis and surgical planning. The tissue-sparing debridement approach adopted represents a strategic departure from historical aggressive methods, aiming to preserve viable tissue while achieving infection control. We propose incorporating vigilant monitoring, optimal nurse-to-patient ratios, and pediatric-specific protocols to enhance early detection and reduce morbidity associated with NSTI. Infectious diseases consultation was involved in guiding antibiotic de-escalation, highlighting the importance of balancing early broad-spectrum coverage with antimicrobial stewardship.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41126165

To improve rational prescribing, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed core prescribing indicators and the AWaRe antibiotic classification. Evidence from Afghanistan remains scarce, especially in outpatient settings.
This cross-sectional prescription audit was conducted from June to December 2024 in six public and private hospitals in Kabul. Prescriptions were sampled from outpatient departments of internal medicine, pediatrics, surgery, and ENT. Of 623 prescriptions screened, 306 (49.1%) contained at least one antibiotic and were analyzed using WHO prescribing indicators and the AWaRe classification. Data were processed with SPSS v25.
A total of 374 antibiotics were prescribed, with an average of 1.5 per prescription. The most common agents were ceftriaxone (19.9%), metronidazole (16.0%), ciprofloxacin (12.4%), and amoxicillin (11.4%). Generic prescribing accounted for 63.3%, while 42.7% of prescriptions included parenteral antibiotics. All antibiotics were from the National Essential Medicines List. AWaRe analysis showed Watch antibiotics (58.6%) predominated, while Access antibiotics (41.4%) were underused; no Reserve antibiotics were prescribed. No culture and sensitivity testing supported prescribing.
Antibiotic prescribing in Kabul outpatient settings substantially exceeded WHO standards, with high reliance on broad-spectrum Watch-group agents, injectables, and non-generic formulations. These findings underscore the urgent need for Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs, prescriber training, and improved diagnostic capacity to ensure rational antibiotic use and contain AMR in Afghanistan.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41126089

This was a multicenter, cross-sectional, observational study conducted between January 1st, and December 31st, 2023, among Italian hospitals. Survey questions were readapted from the WHO IPC assessment framework (IPCAF), PNCAR and INSIEME group proposals, resulting in 155 questions grouped into six sections: IPC program, surveillance, control activities for healthcare-associated infections, antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) strategies, IPC training and education, and monitoring indicators. Thirty-eight acute care Hospitals completed the survey (response rate: 30%): 26.3% of hospitals did not define an annual program and 34.2% an AMS task force. Periodic microbiology reports were available for 57.9%, hospital alcohol-based hand rubs consumption per 1000 bed-days in 42.1% and defined daily dose of antimicrobials per 100 bed-days in 55.3% hospitals with a significant difference between Northern and Southern regions (90.9% vs 22.2%; P = 0.006). Active monitoring of hand hygiene and contact isolation compliance was implemented in only half of the hospitals. Structured HAI surveillance systems were implemented in fewer than 20% of hospitals. Components on IPC implementation activity, such as no-touch sanitizing systems, checklist for environmental cleaning, informatic flags, bundles for pathogens revealed the lowest score. The appropriateness of antibiotic therapy prescribing was assessed in 73.7% of facilities. Only 42.1% of hospitals had budget goals. This survey provides a baseline assessment and identifies key barriers to the implementation of IPC programs across Italian acute care hospitals. The findings highlight priority areas for intervention and will inform the next phase of the INSIEME project, which aims to develop and implement tailored strategies that address the specific needs of healthcare workers and institutions nationwide.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41125745

38059532",Facilitation as an effective strategy to reduce excessive antibiotic prophylaxis in Children's hospitals: A stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial.,"McKay V, Malone S, Tetteh E, Saito J, Rangel S, Bono K, Tao J, Liu J, Obeng H, Atkinson A, Newland JG",2025,Implementation science : IS,"Excessive use of postoperative prophylactic antibiotics in children's hospitals is a significant public health concern, leading to increased risks of infections like Clostridioides difficile, multidrug-resistant organisms, and unnecessary healthcare costs. Antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs) are designed to optimize antibiotic use, but ideal strategies for implementing evidence-based guidelines remain unclear. We tested facilitation, a dynamic process where trained individuals support healthcare personnel in bridging evidence-practice gaps, as a promising strategy for the de-implementation of unnecessary postoperative antibiotics in healthcare.
The OPerAtiC trial employed a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled design across nine hospitals to compare the effectiveness of two ASP-led strategies, specifically order set changes to align with antibiotic guidelines (baseline arm) and facilitation training (intervention arm). Facilitation workshops were informed by the i-PARIHS framework, emphasizing context analysis, evidence application, and recipient engagement; and were conducted remotely. Data were collected from 2019 to 2024, involving interviews with stewardship team members every two months. Data collected included proximal implementation outcomes of each ASP team member (acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness), intermediate outcomes (facilitation skill use) reported by the ASP team, and order set change completion rates.
Proximal implementation outcomes for both strategies were rated high across all study phases, indicating strong baseline enthusiasm among participants (N = 30). Key facilitation skills-effective communication, conflict resolution, and data presentation-were pivotal for successful implementation. Most order set changes (76%) were completed post-facilitation, targeting various specialties and achieving reductions or eliminations in antibiotic use. Facilitation was associated with significantly more completed order sets targeting antibiotic reduction (p = 0.01), suggesting a potential pathway to improve the appropriateness of antibiotic use through implementation strategies.
Facilitation is a valuable approach in refining ASP efforts, contributing to the successful reduction and de-implementation of unnecessary antibiotic use in children's hospitals. The study underscores the need for ongoing training and support for ASP teams to enhance their effectiveness in promoting appropriate antibiotic-prescribing practices. Future research should explore the long-term impacts of facilitation on antibiotic stewardship and patient outcomes.

This qualitative descriptive study was conducted between July and September 2023. In each of eight European countries-Denmark, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain-five semi-structured interviews were carried out with nursing home staff, resulting in a total of 40 interviews. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using systematic text condensation.
Factors perceived to influence infection prevention and antibiotic stewardship were organized into five themes: (1) residents, including the respect for their autonomy, (2) relatives, including their demands for investigations and treatment, (3) physicians, including their attitudes towards antibiotics, (4) staff, including their challenging working conditions and lack of education, and (5) the nursing home environment in which these four actors navigate.
Nursing home staff perceive multiple factors influencing infection prevention, including the challenge of balancing respect for residents' autonomy with maintaining high hygiene standards. A key barrier to effective antimicrobial stewardship appears to be a lack of staff awareness regarding their crucial role in the process.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41117869

The rational use of antimicrobial agents, which is the main strategy for preventing AMR, can be achieved through farmers' knowledge and behaviour. Hence, this study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices of fish farmers regarding antimicrobial use (AMU), AMR and their perceptions (KAPP) of the risk of the emergence of AMR in Cameroon. A cross-sectional study of 364 fish farmers was performed in the Adamawa, Centre, Littoral, South and West Regions using a questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the data. To compare group differences, the Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon tests were run at a significance level of 0.05. Pearson correlation and linear regression were used to determine the directionality, magnitude and nature of the relationships among variables. Overall, the survey revealed poor knowledge of AMU (0.47 ± 0.19) and AMR (0.30 ± 0.29). The attitudes towards and practices of AMU were also poor (0.40 ± 0.28 and 0.47 ± 0.11, respectively). However, the level of risk perception of the emergence of AMR by the fish farmers was fair (0.50 ± 0.29). Locality, age, professional experience, educational level of the fish farmer, training in fish farming and presence of health agents on the farm were associated (","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41116766

36041791",Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease in mother‒child pairs: clinical risk factors and gut microbiota characteristics.,"Zhang C, Duan R, Dai N, Chen Y, Li G, Li X, Ji X, Zhong X, Li Z, Duan L",2025,Journal of Zhejiang University. Science. B,"The risk factors and role of mother‒child gut microbiota in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) remain unclear. We aimed to explore the clinical risk factors associated with PIBD, analyze the characteristics of gut microbiota of children and their mothers, and examine the correlation of the microbial composition in mother‒child pairs.
We conducted a case-control study including children with PIBD and their mothers as the case group, as well as healthy children and their mothers as the control group. Questionnaires were used to collect information such as family illness history and maternal and early-life events. Fecal samples were collected from the children and mothers for microbiota 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing to analyze the composition and its potential association with PIBD.
A total of 54 pairs of cases and 122 pairs of controls were recruited. A family history of autoimmune disease and antibiotic use during pregnancy were associated with an increased risk of PIBD, and a higher education level of the father was associated with a decreased risk of PIBD. Children with PIBD and mothers exhibited different gut microbiota compared to healthy children and mothers. Similarities were observed in the gut microbiota of mothers and children in the same groups. Some bacterial biomarkers of mothers discovered in this study had the power to predict PIBD in their offspring.
PIBD is influenced by maternal risk factors and has unique gut microbiota characteristics. The mother‒child gut microbiota is closely related, suggesting the transmission and influence of the gut microbiota between mothers and children. This study highlights the potential pathogenesis of PIBD and provides a basis for developing targeted interventions.
在儿童炎症性肠病（PIBD）发病中，母子肠道菌群的作用及相关风险因素尚未明确。本研究旨在探究PIBD发病的临床危险因素，分析患儿与母亲的肠道菌群特征，并探讨二者肠道菌群的相关性。研究采用病例-对照设计，纳入54对PIBD患儿及其母亲作为病例组，122对健康儿童及其母亲作为对照组。通过问卷收集家族疾病史、围产期及生命早期事件等信息;采集两组儿童及母亲的粪便样本，进行微生物16S rRNA测序，分析肠道菌群组成及其与PIBD发病的潜在关联。结果显示，自身免疫病家族史、孕期抗生素使用与PIBD发病风险升高相关，而父亲学历较高则与PIBD发病风险降低相关。病例组母子的肠道菌群与对照组存在显著差异，且同组内母亲与子女的肠道菌群具有相似性。此外，母亲的肠道菌群生物标志物可预测其子女患PIBD的风险。综上，PIBD的发病受母源性危险因素影响，患者存在独特的肠道菌群特征;母子肠道菌群的密切关联提示二者间存在菌群传递与相互影响。本研究为阐明PIBD的潜在发病机制提供了依据，并为针对性干预措施的开发奠定了基础。.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41116208

The aim of the study is to comprehensively analyse the prevalence, risk factors, clinical implications and strategies to combat antibiotic resistance in sepsis. Methods include a systematic literature review and evaluation of the effectiveness of different approaches based on empirical evidence. Alarming levels of resistance to reserve-line antibiotics have been observed among Gram-negative pathogens in ICU. Irrational use of antibiotics, lack of adherence to infection control measures and limited implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programmes are key factors contributing to the development and spread of resistance. Infections caused by resistant pathogens are associated with increased mortality, risk of complications, longer hospitalization and higher treatment costs. This creates a situation where opportunities for effective antibiotic therapy become exhausted. Sepsis caused by resistant pathogens significantly complicates treatment and worsens prognosis, increasing the risk of complications and mortality. Overcoming the problem of antibiotic resistance requires a comprehensive approach that includes the development of new antibiotics, rational use of existing drugs, strengthening infection control measures, improving epidemiological surveillance and exploring alternative therapeutic strategies. Antibiotic stewardship programmes (ASPs), infection control measures and combined strategies have demonstrated the greatest effectiveness in combating the spread of resistance in ICU. This study contributes to the understanding of the magnitude of the antibiotic resistance problem and offers specific recommendations for improving clinical practice and health policy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41115031/,

Limited national-level data exist for Kazakhstan, where livestock farming is a major agricultural sector. This study aimed to evaluate antibiotic residues in meat and feed samples collected from across Kazakhstan and assess their implications for public health and food safety.
A cross-sectional survey was conducted between December 2023 and March 2025 across 14 regions of Kazakhstan. A total of 1,026 meat samples (beef, horse, chicken, lamb, and pork) and 150 feed samples (succulent, coarse, concentrated) were collected from licensed facilities. Samples were processed under standard protocols and analyzed using the Evidence Investigator biochip system (Randox, UK), employing Antimicrobial Array I Ultra and Antimicrobial Array II Plus panels. Statistical analyses, including analysis of variance, were performed using International Business Machine Statistical Package for the Social Sciences v25, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05.
Residual antibiotics were detected in all categories of meat and feed, with several concentrations exceeding permissible limits. Succulent feeds showed the highest contamination (streptomycin 86.43 ppb; quinolones 35.56 ppb). Among meats, chicken contained the highest residue levels (quinolones up to 91.97 ppb; streptomycin up to 492.00 ppb), followed by beef (sulfadimethoxine 18.26 ppb; dapsone up to 285.14 ppb). Statistically significant differences were observed among meat types for quinolones (p = 0.000), ceftiofur (p = 0.000), thiamphenicol (p = 0.003), tylosin (p = 0.000), and tetracyclines (p = 0.005). Streptomycin levels varied widely but were not statistically significant (p = 0.072).
The findings highlight uncontrolled antibiotic use in Kazakhstan's livestock sector, particularly in poultry farming. The presence of elevated antibiotic residues in meat and feed underscores urgent food safety concerns and the potential acceleration of AMR. Strengthened regulatory oversight, strict adherence to drug withdrawal periods, and adoption of sustainable alternatives such as probiotics and phytogenic feed additives are crucial. Establishing a national monitoring program and expanding laboratory surveillance capacity are essential steps to safeguard public health and promote safe, sustainable livestock production.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41113203

Point-of-care testing (POCT) for C-reactive protein (CRP) may help differentiate bacterial from viral infections and support more rational antibiotic use. Objective To assess the effectiveness of POCT CRP testing in reducing antibiotic prescription rates among febrile children in an outpatient pediatric setting. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Maharashtra, India, involving 208 children aged one month to 18 years with febrile illness (≤5 days). Participants were randomized into two groups: Group 1 (n=106) received POCT CRP testing, and Group 2 (n=102) received standard clinical care. CRP was measured using the LumiraDx fluorescence immunoassay (LumiraDx UK Ltd, Alloa, UK). The primary outcome was the rate of antibiotic prescription. Results Antibiotic prescription was significantly higher in Group 1 (59.4%) than in Group 2 (46.1%) (p=0.023). Within the POCT group, 84.2% of children with CRP >20 mg/L were prescribed antibiotics compared to 45.6% with CRP ≤20 mg/L (p=0.0001). Elevated CRP levels were significantly associated with antibiotic prescription, especially in cases of fever and abdominal pain. Conclusion POCT CRP influenced physicians' prescribing decisions, particularly when CRP levels exceeded 20 mg/L. However, without structured integration into clinical algorithms, its use alone did not reduce overall antibiotic use. Physician training and adherence to CRP-based guidance are essential to optimize the benefits of POCT CRP in antimicrobial stewardship.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41111836

9475915",Adherence to NICE Guidelines and Centor Criteria in Acute Sore Throat Management: An Audit Cycle.,Lynch C,2025,Cureus,"Introduction Antibiotic stewardship is becoming critically important as resistant bacteria become increasingly prevalent. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as a major global health challenge, driven in part by the misuse and overuse of antibiotics. An acute sore throat is one of the most frequent reasons for patients to seek medical care, yet only a minority of cases require antibiotic treatment. Despite this, inappropriate prescribing is rife, often influenced by diagnostic uncertainty, patient expectations, and non-clinical pressures. These challenges highlight the importance of reinforcing evidence-based strategies, such as the use of Centor criteria, to support accurate assessment and reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing in patients presenting with a sore throat. This quality improvement project evaluated adherence to Centor criteria and subsequent antibiotic prescribing in an accident and emergency (A&E) department in the Northwest of England, before and after clinician education on NICE guidance and documentation of Centor criteria. Materials and methods One hundred patients presenting with an acute sore throat between January and March 2023 were identified. Electronic patient data were collected retrospectively to analyze the documentation's adherence to NICE guidelines and Modified Centor criteria. Results Pre-intervention, 16% of clinicians documented all Centor criteria, 48% incorrectly prescribed antibiotics, and only 20% prescribed appropriate antibiotics. Through post-intervention teaching and literature dissemination, the figures changed to 54%, 22%, and 56%, respectively. Conclusion Targeted clinician education and adherence to NICE guidelines improved antibiotic prescribing for the acute sore throat, underscoring the value of audit cycles while highlighting the need for sustained, larger-scale efforts to reduce AMR.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41111801

33574535","A Pioneering Study Assessing Knowledge and Awareness of Sickle Cell Disease and Its Association with Oral Health Among Pediatric and General Dentists in Madhya Pradesh, India.","Parihar V, Pradhan D, Paul N, Tiwari S, Thakur R, Parihar S, Gupta V, Sinha K, Menon AG, Vishwakarma A",2025,Cureus,"Introduction The region of Central India, particularly Madhya Pradesh, is characterized by a high incidence of sickle cell disease (SCD) affecting diverse demographic groups. Given the intricate relationship between SCD and oral health, this research aims to assess the understanding and awareness of dentists in Madhya Pradesh, focusing on both pediatric and general dental practitioners. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted using a structured, self-administered questionnaire (Google Forms, Google Inc., Mountain View, CA) comprising 22 closed-ended questions. The questionnaire was disseminated to 200 dental professionals, including 100 pediatric dentists and 100 general dentists practicing in Madhya Pradesh, via WhatsApp groups (Meta Platforms Inc., Menlo Park, CA) of dental associations and personal networks. The gathered data underwent analysis via IBM SPSS Statistics software, version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY), revealing statistical patterns and correlations. Results A significant knowledge gap was observed between pediatric dentists and general dentists in Madhya Pradesh regarding the oral health consequences associated with SCD. While 84% of pediatric dentists recognized the association between SCD and oral health, only 30% of general dentists demonstrated correct knowledge. General dentists showed limited understanding in areas such as SCD testing timing (36%), bone marrow transplant as a cure (29%), common oral manifestations (41%), pulp necrosis in healthy teeth (24%), and local anesthesia safety (33%). However, both groups exhibited good knowledge of aspirin contraindications and prophylactic antibiotic use. Conclusion While pediatric dentists showed satisfactory knowledge, general practitioners require supplementary education to improve their awareness and management of SCD. Future studies should expand to multiple states, use objective measures, and include larger, random samples to enhance generalizability. Clinical significance This pioneering study in Madhya Pradesh and India highlights the need for enhanced education on SCD among dental practitioners. It emphasizes training on SCD diagnosis, oral features, and patient management to improve dental care for SCD patients in the region.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41111768

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a combination of ampicillin or benzylpenicillin with gentamicin for severe pneumonia in children aged 2-59 months. Real-world adherence to these guidelines remains limited.
We conducted a retrospective observational study at St. Luke Hospital in Woliso, Ethiopia, including all children aged 2-59 months admitted with severe pneumonia between May 2021 and April 2024. Antibiotic prescriptions were evaluated for adherence to WHO guidelines and categorized using the WHO AWaRe classification. Clinical outcomes were analyzed based on adherence status using univariate and multivariate analyses.
Among 427 patients, 46.1% received guideline-adherent treatment, based on drug selection alone. Gentamicin and ampicillin were underdosed in 94.5% and 62.4% of cases, respectively. Overall, 43.6% of children received at least one antibiotic from the Watch group. In adjusted analyses, adherence to WHO guidelines was associated with longer duration of oxygen therapy (0.7 days, 95% CI: 0.1-1.3, p = 0.02) but showed no significant association with mortality or treatment failure.
Adherence to WHO guidelines was suboptimal, particularly regarding antibiotic dosing. These findings underscore the need for improved antimicrobial stewardship and further evaluation of guideline implementation in Ethiopia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41109411/,10.1016/j.ijid.2025.108116

This qualitative study examined communication between infection control workers and pharmacists at MOH hospitals through semi-structured interviews (
This study identified four key themes from 9 participants (6 male, 3 female) regarding antimicrobial stewardship communication challenges: (1) Patient Safety & Communication - emphasizing protocol adherence, interdisciplinary rounds, and preference for formal channels over WhatsApp; (2) Interdisciplinary Collaboration - where leadership engagement and face-to-face committees enhanced decision-making; (3) Healthcare Delivery Challenges - particularly staffing shortages, excessive workloads, and unclear medication protocols; and (4) Training & Development - revealing gaps in feedback systems, limited educational resources, and reactive crisis communication. Critical findings included the need for structured antibiotic monitoring, COO-level support for stewardship programs, resolution of role ambiguities, and implementation of proactive training initiatives to optimize infection control practices.
Structured communication—through regular meetings, stewardship rounds, and clear antibiotic guidelines—significantly enhanced infection control outcomes by fostering collaboration between pharmacists and infection control teams. This approach improved adherence to protocols, optimized antibiotic use, and strengthened emergency preparedness, directly contributing to patient safety. However, persistent challenges like staffing shortages and training gaps must be addressed to maximize these benefits.

Despite efforts to improve antimicrobial stewardship, behavioral determinants influencing antimicrobial dispensing remain understudied, particularly in low-resource settings like Ethiopia. This study was aimed to explore the behavioral drivers of antimicrobial dispensing among pharmacy professionals working at community drug retail outlets of Addis Ababa. This convergent, parallel mixed-methods study was conducted in three randomly selected sub-cities of Addis Ababa from March to May 2025. The quantitative component addressed the prevalence and predictors of dispensing behavior, surveying 240 pharmacy professionals selected via multi-stage sampling from 120 drug retail outlets. Data were collected using digital (Google Forms) and paper-based questionnaires, measuring TDF-based behavioral determinants and dispensing behavior. Participants were pharmacists and druggists with at least three months of dispensing experience, selected from private pharmacies and drug stores. Hierarchical multiple regression and confirmatory factor analysis were performed using SPSS and AMOS. The qualitative component explored contextual nuances through in-depth interviews with 16 professionals until thematic saturation, analyzed using Dedoose software with a thematic approach, without a predefined framework to allow free expression of feelings. Data quality was ensured through pre-testing, digital validation, and transcription cross-checking. Quantitative findings revealed inappropriate dispensing in 53.75% of cases (129/240). One-sample t-tests showed significant positive deviations for most TDF domains (p < .001), except environmental context (p = .642). Hierarchical regression indicated demographic and behavioral factors explained 62% of dispensing behavior variance, with age (β = 0.630, p < .001), female gender (β = 0.343, p < .001), and behavioral factors; (Professional Role and Self-Regulation: β = 0.456, p < .001; Emotional and Social Dynamics: (β = 0.359, p < .001)) as positive predictors, while Skills and Belief Systems (β=-0.431, p < .001) and experience (≥ 5 years) negatively predicted appropriate dispensing (β=-0.304, p < .001). Qualitative insights highlighted systemic barriers, including patient pressure, profit motives, and weak regulatory enforcement, which often overrode professional knowledge. Triangulation revealed that while pharmacists understood guidelines, workplace pressures and financial incentives drove non-compliance. Inappropriate antimicrobial dispensing was prevalent and significantly influenced by key determinants: longer experience negatively predicted appropriate dispensing, while female gender positively predicted it. Behavioral factors, particularly social and commercial pressures like patient demand and competition, were stronger drivers than knowledge alone.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41107407

While antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are a key intervention, a comprehensive synthesis of their impact on antibiotic use in this context is lacking.
This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to synthesize current evidence regarding the association between ASPs and antibiotic use in Africa.
MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and regional databases including african journals online and WHO global index medicus will be searched systematically. Original studies of the association of ASPs with antimicrobial consumption across healthcare settings will be included while Animal and environmental studies will be excluded. Two independent reviewers will screen articles, extract data, and assess quality using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) quality assessment tool. The main outcome measures will be proportion of patients receiving anantibiotic prescription and defined daily doses per 100 patient days. The pooled association of targeted ASPs with antimicrobial consumption will be be measured using multilevel random-effects models.
This systematic review and meta-analysis is expected to provide valuable, pooled evidence on the effectiveness of ASPs in reducing antimicrobial consumption in Africa. The findings will inform and call for evidence based interventions by governments and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) to combat AMR in resource limited settings.

31035663",Antibiotic Prescription for Acute Diverticulitis: Evaluation of Compliance With National Guidelines.,"Mateen U, Imtiaz H, Yusufi MA, Siddiqi N, Froggatt P",2025,Cureus,"Diverticulitis is a common surgical problem that can be categorised as uncomplicated or complicated diverticulitis. National guidelines for managing acute diverticulitis recommend that antibiotics should only be given to patients who are systemically unwell, have a background of immunosuppression or have complicated diverticulitis. We analysed the compliance with these guidelines at our hospital, identified gaps, and introduced appropriate measures to improve service provision.
This was a closed-loop audit. The first cycle was a retrospective analysis conducted between July and December 2024. Following the identification of gaps in practice, appropriate educational interventions were undertaken, and a second audit cycle was conducted to evaluate their impact. The second cycle was prospectively undertaken between February and May 2025. Adult patients with a computed tomography-confirmed diagnosis of acute diverticulitis met the inclusion criteria. Measured outcomes included demographics, signs and symptoms at presentation, relevant imaging, observations and antibiotic prescription. Standards were derived from National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines with target compliance set at 100%.
Forty-three patients were evaluated during the first audit cycle. 24/43 (56%) patients had uncomplicated diverticulitis. Of these, 3/24 were immunocompromised and were appropriately prescribed antibiotics; all the remaining 21/24 patients with a competent immune system and systemically well were given antibiotics against the recommendations, resulting in non-compliance with standards. 19/43 (44%) had complicated diverticulitis, with all receiving antibiotics as recommended, therefore resulting in 100% compliance. Following appropriate interventions, the subsequent audit cycle was conducted, where 35 patients were included in the second cycle. 26/35 had uncomplicated diverticulitis; of these, 8 (31%) required antibiotics due to systemic illness or immunosuppression, 12 (46%) were not prescribed antibiotics in line with the standard, while 6 (23%) unnecessarily received antibiotics against the standard. Compliance therefore improved from 0% to 66% between audit cycles with regards to managing uncomplicated diverticulitis. All nine of the remaining 35 patients with complicated diverticulitis received appropriate antibiotics, achieving 100% compliance, consistent with the previous audit cycle.
This quality improvement project highlights the importance of differentiating amongst complicated and uncomplicated diverticulitis, which therefore dictates management, and potentially avoids unnecessary administration of intravenous antibiotics and hospital stay. This article aims to increase awareness among relevant surgical teams in order to improve patient outcomes and reduce pressures on the health care system.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41103853

40784899",C5L2 gene polymorphisms and their functional interaction with metabolic-inflammatory networks in T2DM-associated CHD: insights from an integrative genetic and clinical analysis in a Chinese population.,"Liu M, Liu F, Abulaiti D, Yang J, Wang Y, Ye M, Jia T, Gao Y",2025,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,"Comorbid type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and coronary heart disease (CHD) represent a major clinical burden, driven by overlapping metabolic and inflammatory mechanisms. Genetic factors are increasingly recognized as contributors to individual susceptibility, yet the specific variants influencing T2DM-associated CHD remain incompletely defined. Complement 5a receptor 2 (C5L2) serves as a receptor for acylation-stimulating protein (ASP) and C5a, regulating glucose uptake, triglyceride clearance, lipid metabolism, and immune signaling, and has been implicated in both pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways. This study investigates whether C5L2 polymorphisms are associated with T2DM-CHD and integrate with metabolic and inflammatory markers in the Han Chinese population from Xinjiang.
A hospital-based case-control study was conducted involving 951 adult participants (206 with T2DM and CHD, and 745 controls), who were genotyped for two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), C5L2 rs2972607 and rs8112962, using improved multiplex ligation detection reaction methods. Clinical, hematologic, and biochemical traits were measured. Logistic regression assessed genotype-disease and genotype-phenotype links (sex-adjusted). MDR evaluated high-order gene-environment interactions using 10-fold cross-validation and balanced accuracy.
rs2972607 was significantly associated with HDL-C, lymphocytes, platelet indices, AST/ALT, UCB, and 5'-NT; rs8112962 was associated with monocytes and HDL-C. Sex-stratified analyses confirmed associations between HDL-C and UCB in both sexes; platelet effects were stronger in females. In multivariable models, rs2972607 remained a modest but significant independent predictor (OR = 2.07; 
C5L2 polymorphisms, particularly rs2972607, are modest but consistent contributors to T2DM-associated CHD and integrate with lipid, platelet, and inflammatory markers, highlighting a potential role in immune-metabolic interplay. While our findings are observational and hypothesis-generating, they are biologically plausible and align with established C5L2 biology, suggesting that integrating C5L2 genotyping with biochemical profiling may refine individualized risk prediction and guide future mechanistic studies.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41103368

18789799",Examining tailoring as an implementation strategy for reducing healthcare-associated infections across European acute care hospitals (REVERSE): study protocol for a hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial.,"Albers B, Caci L, Blum K, Boland G, Carrara E, Gentil PR, Nguyen A, Pollard J, Schechner V, Sonpar A, Yanagida T, Zingg W, Consortium LCOBOTR",2025,Trials,"Infection prevention and control (IPC) and antibiotic stewardship (ABS) represent promising approaches for reducing the prevalence of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in different healthcare settings. However, the combined use of IPC and ABS measures and ways to optimize their integrated implementation have been insufficiently considered and assessed. The REVERSE trial, funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 program, involves 24 acute care hospitals from four European countries, all with high rates of AMR and HAI. REVERSE aims to investigate whether the sequential implementation of an IPC and an ABS practice bundle is feasible and sustainable and whether externally guided tailoring as an enhanced implementation strategy leads to superior clinical and implementation outcomes compared to a basic implementation condition.
REVERSE will be designed as a stepped wedge cluster randomized, hybrid type 2 trial, including an embedded implementation trial. Four cohorts of six acute care hospitals will sequentially enter the trial over 38 months and work to implement first IPC, and, after 1 year, add the ABS practice bundle. Simultaneously, hospitals will be provided basic implementation training and instructed to tailor their implementation, with half of the hospitals being self-guided in their tailoring, whereas hospitals in the enhanced implementation condition will receive time-limited external facilitation in practicing tailoring. Qualitative data will be collected longitudinally to investigate contextual conditions for implementing IPC and ABS locally and how they contribute to tailoring results. IPC and ABS feasibility, fidelity, and sustainability will be assessed together with tailoring fidelity using repeated measures. Retrospective, in-depth, explanatory case studies will be conducted to interpret hospital outcomes.
REVERSE is an extensive and complex effectiveness-implementation trial aimed at investigating tailoring effectiveness. It will contribute to the still scarce evidence base for this adaptive approach to integrating research-supported interventions into routine healthcare settings. By identifying pathways toward strengthening the integration of IPC and ABS practices at European acute care hospitals, REVERSE also has the potential to inform much-needed concerted efforts to combat the growing challenge of antimicrobial resistance in the region.
In November 2021, the REVERSE study was registered with the ""International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number"" (ISRCTN) register under nr.12956554.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41102820

39512269",Leveraging artificial intelligence for One Health: opportunities and challenges in tackling antimicrobial resistance - scoping review.,"Kasse GE, Cosh SM, Humphries J, Islam MS",2025,One health outlook,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health challenge driven by the misuse of antimicrobials across humans, animals, and the environment, necessitating integrated One Health solutions.
This scoping review aims to synthesise evidence on the opportunities and challenges of leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to tackle AMR within the One Health framework.
This review adhered to the PRISMA-ScR guideline. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, along with citation searching and Google Scholar.
A total of 543 studies were identified from these databases. After removing duplicates, 343 studies remained for screening. Following the title and abstract screening, 273 publications were selected for full-text review, and 43 studies were included in the final analysis. Studies written in English that explored the application of AI tools and techniques for AMR in any One Health domain were included. The review found that AI is widely applied to combat AMR across different sectors (human, animal, and environmental health), with key opportunities including the rapid identification of resistant pathogens, AI-powered surveillance and early warning, integration of diverse datasets, and support for drug discovery and antibiotic stewardship. However, significant challenges remain, such as data standardisation issues, limited model transparency, infrastructure and resource gaps, ethical and privacy concerns, and difficulties in real-world implementation and validation.
Overall, while AI has great potential to improve AMR management, fully realising its benefits will require investment in explainable AI, better data infrastructure, stronger cross-sector collaboration, and clear regulatory frameworks to ensure ethical and effective use within the One Health approach.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41102753

We conducted a prospective observational study to test a novel chemiluminescence assay that helps differentiating bacterial and viral infections by combining three host-response proteins (C-reactive protein, TRAIL and IP-10). We enrolled 255 children (age 1-243 months) presenting to a Pediatric Infectious Diseases Unit with fever (60%), cough (22.4%), gastrointestinal symptoms (22%), proven infection (38%). The 22.7% of patients carried at least one comorbidity. The baseline test demonstrated 51% sensitivity and 91% specificity. The diagnostic accuracy was better than traditional biomarkers (C-reactive protein, white blood cell count). Stratifying the analysis by pre-admission antibiotic treatment, naïve patients showed higher sensitivity for bacterial infection (0.70 vs. 0.15), better negative predictive value (0.60 vs. 0.45) and lower error rate (0.24 vs. 0.51). A significant score reduction was observed shortly after starting antibiotic therapy in a subgroup with microbiologically confirmed bacterial diagnosis (mean - 45.12, mean interval = 4 days). We concluded the test could improve infection management in pediatric settings, support initial therapy decision and potentially reduce unnecessary antibiotics. However, its optimal implementation requires a precise definition of the target population.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41102329

We estimated incidence rates of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis diagnoses and related antibiotic prescribing among US males and transgender individuals using Merative MarketScan® Research Databases during 2017-2019. Follow-up encompassed 38,543 person-years among recipients of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), 29,228 person-years among people living with HIV (PLWH), and 19,918 person-years among people with prior-year STI diagnoses. Incidence rates of STI diagnoses among PLWH and PrEP recipients with ≥1 prior-year STI diagnosis totaled 33.3-35.5 per 100 person-years. Direct effects of doxyPEP could prevent 7.4-9.6 gonorrhea diagnoses, 7.3-8.1 chlamydia diagnoses, and 3.1-5.9 syphilis diagnoses per 100 person-years of use. However, expected increases in tetracycline consumption resulting from doxyPEP implementation totaled 271.9-312.9 additional 7-day doxycycline treatment courses per 100 person-years of use. These increases corresponded to 37.0-38.7, 36.5-37.0, and 46.1-100.2 additional 7-day doxycycline treatment courses for each prevented gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis diagnosis, respectively. Increases in doxycycline use exceeded anticipated reductions in STI-related prescribing of cephalosporins, macrolides, and penicillins by 16-69-fold margins. Anticipated changes in antibiotic use as well as STI incidence should inform priority-setting for doxyPEP.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41102210

41101393,Evolution of the inappropriate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections following the 2022 CA-SFM guidelines.,"Ourghanlian C, Kharchenko D, Fihman V, Galy A, Woerther PL, Lepeule R",2025,Infectious diseases now,"The European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) changed the definition of the 'intermediate' (I) category in 2019, now defined as 'susceptible, increased exposure'. We previously reported an increase in prescriptions for antibiotics still reported as 'S', compared with those now reported as 'I'. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of a more explicit abbreviation (SFP or 'Susceptible increased exposure') than 'I' on the use of overly broad-spectrum antibiotics for the treatment of infections caused by wild-type (WT) Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
A retrospective observational multicenter study was conducted across five hospitals. Two study periods were defined, before and after the implementation of the new abbreviation (from September 2020 to February 2022, and from March 2022 to August 2023). All patients with an infection caused by WT P.aeruginosa treated with β-lactams were included. The main endpoint was the proportion of patients treated with an overly broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment by meropenem or ceftolozane/tazobactam.
A total of 279 patients were included. No difference between groups was found, in terms of infection, microbiology, or demographic characteristics. Eight overly broad-spectrum antibiotic treatments by meropenem or ceftolozane/tazobactam were observed in Period 1 (5.6 %), versus one in Period 2 (0.7 %; p = 0.026). No overly broad-spectrum treatment was observed when the antimicrobial stewardship team had given advice.
The French recommendations derived from the EUCAST guidelines, with a new abbreviation, have contributed to a reduction in the prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics and have helped mitigate clinicians' misunderstanding of the previous guidelines.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41101393/,10.1016/j.idnow.2025.105166
41100370,Prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of ESKAPE pathogens in skin and soft tissue infections.,"Singh KN, Agarwal K, Singh P, Rukadikar AR, Hada V, Mohanty A, Rana S, Rahul A, Mishra S",2025,"Indian journal of dermatology, venereology and leprology","Background Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) encompass a wide range of conditions, from superficial infections to life-threatening necrotising fasciitis. Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp. (ESKAPE pathogens) are leading causes of SSTIs and are notable for their antimicrobial resistance. Aim This study aims to determine the prevalence of SSTIs and analyze the resistance patterns of ESKAPE pathogens,providing critical insights for effective treatment strategies. Methods A prospective, observational, cross-sectional study was conducted from January to December 2024 in the Bacteriology section of the Department of Microbiology. A total of 2,300 clinical specimens, including pus, pus swabs, and tissue samples, were processed using standard microbiological techniques. Isolates were identified, and antibiotic susceptibility was assessed following the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Results Among 2,300 samples, 1,311 (57%) were culture-positive, with ESKAPE pathogens detected in 808 (61.6%) culture-positive isolates. Staphylococcus aureus (59.5%) was the most frequently isolated organism, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.8%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was found in 52.2% of isolates. Among Gram-negative bacteria, 15.3% were multidrug-resistant (MDR), but all remained susceptible to colistin. Limitations Conducted at a single center without long-term follow-up, the study may not capture regional differences in resistance, patient demographics, or healthcare practices, nor assess sustained intervention outcomes or relapses. Conclusion ESKAPE pathogens contribute significantly to SSTIs, posing a challenge due to their resistance mechanisms. The high prevalence of MRSA and MDR Gram-negative bacteria highlights the need for continuous surveillance, rational antibiotic use, and alternative treatment strategies to combat antimicrobial resistance effectively.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41100370/,10.25259/IJDVL_417_2025

41094731,Decreased Lumbar Puncture Utilization Following Implementation of Febrile Infant Guidelines in a Pediatric ED.,"Guernsey D, Horner C, Patel P",2025,Pediatric emergency care,"Fever in infants under 60 days old raises concern for invasive bacterial infections. In 2021, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released updated guidelines, including revised recommendations for infants aged 22 to 28 days, to reduce unnecessary lumbar punctures (LP), hospitalizations, and antibiotic use. This study hypothesized that the guidelines would reduce LPs, specifically in the newly stratified age group.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a single pediatric emergency department of febrile infants aged 22 to 60 days presenting between October 1, 2019, and September 30, 2023, with October 1, 2021, being the division between groups. Infants were excluded if ill-appearing, <37 weeks of gestation, or had complex medical histories. The primary outcome was the proportion undergoing LP. Subgroup analysis was performed by age group, and those identified as low-risk by initial laboratory evaluation. Secondary outcomes included hospital admission, length of stay, and antibiotic use.
A total of 132 infants met the inclusion criteria (52 pre-guidelines, 80 post-guidelines), and no exclusion criteria were applied. Following guidelines, the proportion of LPs had a statistically significant decrease (P=0.02), with the reduction maintained in the 22- to 28-day subgroup (P=0.002). The rate of hospital admission and antibiotics followed a similar statistically significant decrease post-guideline introduction, which also maintained for the 22- to 28-day subgroup. There was no statistically significant difference for length of stay or in the 29- to 60-day subgroup analyses. For infants identified as low-risk by laboratory risk-stratification, we discovered a statistically significant reduction in LP following the guidelines (P <0.001).
Implementation of the 2021 AAP guidelines was associated with reduced LPs, hospitalizations, and antibiotic use in infants aged 22 to 60 days, with the greatest impact in the 22- to 28-day subgroup. These guidelines improve risk stratification and reduce invasive interventions while maintaining safe care. While the small sample size limits generalizability, these findings suggest a positive shift in clinical practice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41094731/,10.1097/PEC.0000000000003499

30243707",Comparison between vacuum sealing drainage (VSD) and conventional dressing for fournier's gangrene: a single-centre retrospective study.,"Li X, Zhang Y, Xiong F, Li J, Qi S, Wang Q, Mu S, Cao D, Niu S, Liu W, Liu L, Zhang Z",2025,BMC surgery,"Fournier's gangrene (FG) is a life-threatening infection associated with high mortality and often necessitates urgent surgical intervention. Vacuum sealing drainage (VSD) has emerged as a promising adjunct to surgical debridement; however, its impact on antibiotic stewardship remains inadequately studied. This study compares the efficacy of VSD and conventional dressings in the management of FG.
In this single-center retrospective study, 104 patients with Fournier's gangrene (FG) treated between January 2022 and December 2023 were analyzed. Patients were categorized into VSD (n = 42) and conventional dressing (n = 62) groups following surgical debridement. Data included demographics, comorbidities, infection sites, Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) scores, antibiotic duration, and clinical outcomes. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was applied to mitigate confounding biases.
Before IPTW adjustment, the VSD group exhibited longer durations in key clinical outcomes compared to the control group, including time to leukocyte normalization (+ 1.6 days), antibiotic use (+ 2.0 days), and hospital stay (+ 2.0 days). After IPTW adjustment, all three indicators showed improvement in favor of the VSD group. Generalized weighted regression further confirmed that VSD was associated with significant clinical benefits: shortened time to leukocyte normalization (mean difference: -1.8 days; 90% CI: -3.5 to -0.1), reduced duration of antibiotic therapy (-2.0 days; 90% CI: -3.7 to -0.4), and decreased length of hospitalization (-3.0 days; 90% CI:-5.7 to -0.4).Post-IPTW, VSD emerged as a protective factor, with all standardized mean differences (SMDs) remaining below 0.2, indicating acceptable covariate balance.
VSD may improve clinical outcomes in patients with Fournier's gangrene by accelerating recovery and reducing antibiotic use and length of hospitalization. These benefits appear more pronounced in patients with high LRINEC scores or extensive infections. Nevertheless, individualized treatment strategies should consider systemic disease severity, such as the Fournier's Gangrene Severity Index (FGSI).","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41094492

34416341",Development of an interpretable machine learning model for predicting prolonged hospital stay in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a retrospective cohort study.,"Chen J, Chen Z, Yang S, Jiang H, Xie C",2025,BMC medical informatics and decision making,"Prolonged hospital stay in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) significantly impacts patient outcomes and healthcare resource allocation. This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable machine learning (ML) model for forecasting prolonged hospital stays of the AECOPD population.
A retrospective analysis was performed utilizing data from the MIMIC-IV database on patients diagnosed with AECOPD. The dataset was split into a training set (80%) and a validation set (20%). Feature selection was executed through LASSO regression and the Boruta algorithm. Logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), neural network (NN), gradient boosting machine (GBM), naive Bayes (NB), as well as K-nearest neighbors (KNN) models were constructed based on the selected features. Model performance was evaluated via receiver operating characteristic (ROC), calibration and decision curves. The interpretability of the optimal model was enhanced through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis.
7,373 AECOPD patients were encompassed. The final model incorporated the following features: hemoglobin, platelet count, anion gap, blood urea nitrogen(BUN), potassium, chloride, antibiotic use, invasive ventilation, vasopressor use, SOFA, body temperature(Tb), heart rate(HR), acute kidney injury (AKI), as well as sepsis. The RF model demonstrated the best predictive performance, with an area of the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.817 in the training set and 0.715 in the validation set, along with good calibration and clinical utility. SHAP analysis further enhanced the interpretability of the model, providing valuable clinical decision support.
The RF model developed in our study exhibited excellent performance in predicting prolonged hospital stays in AECOPD patients. The incorporation of interpretability analysis improved the transparency and reliability of its clinical application.

Since the World Health Organization recommended use of typhoid conjugate vaccines in 2018, several countries have introduced or begun the decision-making process to use the vaccine in campaigns or by introduction into the routine immunization schedule. This paper describes the disease burden and vaccine implementation policy setting in the region, based on presentations and discussions at the second Asia Regional Meeting on Typhoid & TCV. Moving forward, typhoid control efforts must prioritize 1) working across health and finance ministries to finance vaccination programs, 2) strengthening surveillance to better understand disease burden, drug resistance trends, and vaccine impact, 3) developing improved diagnostic tests, 4) stewarding antimicrobial use to slow the spread of drug resistance, and 5) evaluating the durability of TCV protection.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41092802/,10.1016/j.vaccine.2025.127848

36590125",Knowledge and practices related to antimicrobial use in fighting cocks - a survey of fighting cock owners in Timor-Leste.,"Pereira AJ, Amaral F, Coppo MJC, Bailey KE, Ting S, Gilkerson J, Browning GF, Jong JBDC, Toribio JLML",2025,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,"Cock fighting is an industry with a long standing in Southeast Asia and the birds have a high value. However, there is scant published literature on antimicrobial use and knowledge about antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among fighting cock owners in Timor-Leste. This survey assessed knowledge of fighting cock owners about antimicrobials and AMR, and their use of antimicrobials in fighting cocks.
This was a cross-sectional survey conducted on randomly selected owners of fighting cocks in urban areas in Timor-Leste between February and March 2023. Data collection was done using a structured questionnaire administered by face-to-face interviews.
A total of 275 participants were interviewed. Knowledge about antimicrobials and AMR among fighting cock owners in Timor-Leste was poor. Owners in urban areas (aOR = 2.4, 95% CI [1.4-4.1], p-value = 0.002) and those with higher education (aOR = 2.3, 95% CI [1.3-4.2], p-value = 0.007) were more knowledgeable about antimicrobials. The majority used antimicrobials (76.2%, 205/269) in their cocks and the most common antimicrobials used were amoxicillin (77.5%, 159/205) and ampicillin (54.2%, 111/205). The most common reasons for use were for treating fight wounds (85.4%, 175/205), respiratory signs (26.3%, 54/205), and diarrhea (21.0%, 43/205).
This study revealed widespread antimicrobial use by fighting cock owners with low awareness about AMR, which creates a high-risk environment for selection for emergence of AMR. There is a need for a comprehensive intervention that combines regulatory controls, enhanced surveillance, and a targeted campaign to mitigate public health risks in Timor-Leste.","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41089327
