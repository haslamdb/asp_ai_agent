    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is a growing threat to public health. Improper use of antibiotics can potentially lead to previously curable infections becoming unmanageable. Rampant unnecessary use of antibiotics is a serious problem within developing countries like Pakistan, and dental practices can often be traced as a major cause. Through the widespread implementation of antibiotic stewardship programs (ASP), medical and dental practitioners can be guided to appropriate prescribing practices and better patient education. To gauge current antimicrobial prescribing practices of dentists and their engagement with ASPs. 13 dental practitioners were interviewed using a semi-structured interview template. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and subjected to thematic analysis. The subjects were selected from various dental hospitals within Punjab, using a convenient sampling approach. The sample size was based on the point of saturation of emerging themes. Many factors were highlighted as causative for the current state of misinformation regarding antibiotic prescription practices among dental practitioners and patients. Awareness regarding ASP was severely lacking; however, most participants showed a positive perception regarding ASP and their impact. Institutional support and the need for implementation of such programs within the educational curriculum were noted as important steps for ASP implementation within dental hospitals of Pakistan. This study found that knowledge regarding ASP was insufficient among dental practitioners, owing to a lack of institutional policies and awareness among the practitioners. The outcome of the lack of these programs and misinformation among both patients and dentists is widely contributing to the current state of antibiotic resistance in Pakistan. Die Antibiotikaresistenz stellt eine wachsende Bedrohung f\u00fcr die \u00f6ffentliche Gesundheit dar. Der unsachgem\u00e4\u00dfe Einsatz von Antibiotika kann dazu f\u00fchren, dass zuvor heilbare Infektionen unbeherrschbar werden. Der \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfige, unn\u00f6tige Einsatz von Antibiotika ist in Entwicklungsl\u00e4ndern wie Pakistan ein ernstes Problem, und die zahn\u00e4rztliche Praxis kann oft als eine der Hauptursachen angesehen werden. Durch die fl\u00e4chendeckende Einf\u00fchrung von Antibiotic-Stewardship-Programmen (ASP) k\u00f6nnen \u00c4rzte und Zahn\u00e4rzte zu einer angemessenen Verschreibungspraxis und einer besseren Patientenaufkl\u00e4rung angeleitet werden. Beurteilung der derzeitigen Verschreibungspraxis von antimikrobiellen Mitteln durch Zahn\u00e4rzte und deren Engagement f\u00fcr ASP. 13 Zahn\u00e4rzte wurden anhand einer halbstrukturierten Interviewvorlage befragt. Die Interviews wurden aufgezeichnet, transkribiert und thematisch analysiert. Die Probanden wurden aus verschiedenen Zahnkliniken im Punjab nach dem Prinzip der Zufallsstichprobe ausgew\u00e4hlt. Die Stichprobengr\u00f6\u00dfe wurde auf der Grundlage des S\u00e4ttigungsgrades der sich ergebenden Themen festgelegt. Viele Faktoren wurden als Ursache f\u00fcr den gegenw\u00e4rtigen Zustand der Fehlinformation in Bezug auf die Verschreibungspraxis von Antibiotika unter Zahn\u00e4rzten und Patienten hervorgehoben. Das Bewusstsein f\u00fcr ASP war sehr schwach ausgepr\u00e4gt; die meisten Teilnehmer zeigten jedoch eine positive Einstellung zu ASP und deren Auswirkungen. Die institutionelle Unterst\u00fctzung und die Notwendigkeit der Implementierung solcher Programme in den Lehrplan wurden als wichtige Schritte f\u00fcr die Implementierung von ASP in pakistanischen Zahnkliniken genannt. Die Studie ergab, dass das Wissen \u00fcber ASP bei Zahn\u00e4rzten unzureichend ist, was auf fehlende institutionelle Ma\u00dfnahmen und mangelndes Bewusstsein bei den \u00c4rzten zur\u00fcckzuf\u00fchren ist. Das Fehlen dieser Programme und die Fehlinformation sowohl der Patienten als auch der Zahn\u00e4rzte tragen in hohem Ma\u00dfe zur derzeitigen Situation der Antibiotikaresistenz in Pakistan bei.",

    "abstract": "The inappropriate use of antibiotics is a major contributor to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which is a critical issue in low and middle-income countries such as Iraq. Nurse-led clinics in Iraq are a common point of care for patients seeking treatment for infectious diseases; however, they are currently poorly regulated. This study aimed to assess the extent and appropriateness of antibiotic dispensing in this setting, including the quality of dispensing. In these clinics, only two antibiotics are legally permitted for dispensing. These are amoxicillin and erythromycin. The findings can be used to provide future guidance to improve antibiotic use in the country and reduce AMR where there are concerns. A cross-sectional study was undertaken using simulated clients among 235 randomly selected nurse-led clinics in Iraq, presenting with a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). The outcomes included the prevalence, type of antibiotics supplied, including their Access, Watch, and Reserve (AWaRe) classification, as well as the extent and quality of patient counselling. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise dispensing patterns and counselling practices. Multivariable logistic regression was also applied to assess associations between provider's characteristics and inappropriate antibiotic dispensing. Antibiotics were supplied inappropriately in 60.0% (141/235) of the encounters, with 36.1% (85/235) of them involving antibiotics not legally permitted to be dispensed in these clinics. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid accounted for 34.0% (48/141) of the antibiotics supplied. Based on their AWaRe classification, 25.5% (36/141) of these were Watch antibiotics. Only 24.8% of providers asked additional clinical questions, and allergy screening occurred in just 7.8% of cases. Clinics with higher-qualified staff were significantly less likely to dispense antibiotics. Widespread inappropriate and, in many cases, illegal antibiotic dispensing was observed in Iraqi nurse-led clinics, with limited patient assessment. These findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced antimicrobial stewardship, provider education, and regulatory enforcement to address AMR in Iraq. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a substantial threat to public health as it reduces the number of effective antibiotics available to combat infections affecting patients as well as increasing costs and deaths. Iraq is a critical country with high and growing rates of AMR, with associated deaths. Consequently, there is a need to address this. Nurse-led clinics are a key part of primary healthcare delivery in Iraq; however, little is known about the management of patients with respiratory infections in these clinics. Our research identified that 60% of patients with mild respiratory infections that do not require antibiotics received them. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) in these clinics are allowed to dispense two antibiotics without a prescription; however, an appreciable number of antibiotics were dispensed outside of these two antibiotics. Of additional concern is that patients were not typically asked key questions during the consultation including any known allergies to penicillin products. Encouragingly, clinics staffed with higher-qualified HCPs were significantly less likely to dispensing antibiotics for mild respiratory infections. Overall, there is a need for appreciable education among patients and HCPs in Iraq to improve the future use of antibiotics alongside a decrease in AMR in the country.",

Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) are key community health workers in India who can be empowered to promote rational antibiotic use. To compare the effectiveness of gamified versus conventional teaching methods in improving AMR-related knowledge among ASHAs in Mysuru, south India. A prospective interventional study was conducted among 73 ASHAs during World Antimicrobial Awareness Week 2024. Group A (n\u2009=\u200931) received gamified training using interactive games, and Group B (n\u2009=\u200942) received conventional teaching through lectures and board-based instruction. Knowledge was assessed using a 25-item questionnaire before and after the intervention. Data were analysed via Wilcoxon signed-rank and Mann-Whitney U tests. Knowledge improved in both groups, but gains were markedly higher with gamification. The mean post-test score reached 86.08% in gamified training versus 54.48% for conventional teaching (p\u2009<\u20090.001; effect size r\u2009=\u20090.75). Gamified training consistently outperformed conventional methods across all infection domains, leading to predominantly good-to-excellent knowledge levels. Gamified interventions substantially enhanced ASHAs' knowledge compared to conventional teaching, offering a scalable and low-cost strategy to strengthen antimicrobial stewardship in community settings. Long-term studies are needed to assess retention and behavior change.",

This article explores the &ldquo;dark side&rdquo; of antibiotics, highlighting their role in disrupting the gut microbiome, elevating risks for infections like Clostridium difficile, and increasing resistance in Cutibacterium acnes and other microbes. Emerging evidence also links antibiotic use to reduced vaccine efficacy and diminished responses to cancer immunotherapy. To mitigate these risks, dermatologists should prioritize narrow-spectrum antibiotics and incorporate combination topical therapies containing benzoyl peroxide (BPO), such as the triple-combination of clindamycin, adapalene, and BPO, to help curb antibiotic resistance. Prudent antibiotic use, combined with topical regimens utilizing BPO, optimizes treatment outcomes while minimizing systemic adverse effects and resistance. Ongoing education and research are essential to refine prescribing practices that balance therapeutic benefits with long-term patient and public health.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant global threat to human and animal health, necessitating robust surveillance and stewardship tools. While existing systems address aspects of veterinary AMR, a comprehensive, user-centric dashboard for U.S. veterinarians remains a critical unmet need. This study aimed to identify U.S. veterinarians' preferences and perceived needs for such a dashboard, to help guide its design and development. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between January and March 2024, targeting U.S. veterinarians through professional channels. The survey instrument captured demographics, experiences with existing tools, preferences for data types and visualizations, desired technical specifications, and open-ended feedback. Of the 677 respondents, a near-unanimous consensus (over 75%) emerged on the importance of functionalities like antimicrobial stewardship education, off-label use guidance, surveillance data, and empirical treatment support. Over 70% expressed comfort sharing aggregated geographic and de-identified animal data. A strong preference was observed for making the dashboard accessible by veterinary colleges (78.87%), diagnostic laboratories (72.61%), and federal agencies (USDA: 71.47%, CDC: 66.67%, FDA: 62.11%), indicating a desire for a collaborative, authoritative system. The findings provide a robust foundation for developing a U.S. veterinary AMR dashboard. Future phases should adopt an iterative, user-centered design, incorporating qualitative research with diverse stakeholders and piloting a prototype with preferred institutional partners.

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a global health threat, especially in low-income and middle-income countries. Community health workers (CHWs) are key actors in infection management and health promotion; however, their involvement in antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) remains unclear. This study aims to assess CHWs' roles in AMS, examine their training and support, and evaluate outcomes regarding antibiotic use and resistance. A scoping review was conducted to explore the roles, education, training and antimicrobial-related outcomes of CHWs. The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines, with the protocol registered in Open Science Framework. Databases including PubMed, EMBASE and CINAHL were searched for studies published in English and Spanish. A narrative synthesis was applied to the identified articles, with the Integrated Quality Criteria for the Review of Multiple Study Designs and Quality Assessment Tool for Studies with Diverse Designs tools employed to assess the risk of bias. Eight studies were identified, conducted in Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Kenya. CHWs were involved in various AMS activities, such as infection prevention, detection and treatment of conditions such as pneumonia and gastrointestinal infections. CHWs contributed to health education, antibiotic prescription (when authorised) and improved adherence to guidelines. Positive outcomes included reduced inappropriate antibiotic use and increased community awareness of AMR. However, the effectiveness of these interventions varied depending on the local context and resources. CHWs play an important role in promoting responsible antibiotic use and addressing AMR, particularly in underserved settings. Strengthening their training, expanding selected roles and responsibilities and improving support mechanisms should be considered to enhance their potential contribution to AMS programmes. Further research is needed to optimise CHW interventions and evaluate their long-term impact.",

    "abstract": "The use of antimicrobials in human and animal health care settings is considered a major driving force behind the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, encouraging a focus on evidence-based interventions aimed at promoting behaviours aligned with antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) ideals within both sectors. The Arwain complex intervention within Wales established peer networks of 'Veterinary Prescribing Champions' (VPCs) within and between Welsh veterinary practices to facilitate AMS training, support and activity. This study evaluates AMS goal setting and implementation within continuously engaged Arwain veterinary practices ( Descriptive quantitative analysis of Practice Action Plans (2020, 2024) and self-reported data on Action Plan implementation (2024), combined with qualitative analysis of participant interviews (2023) and participatory workshop feedback (2024) on challenges to implementing change, offer insight on the focus, achievements and implementation of AMS within the Arwain complex intervention. VPCs focused on behaviour-led (practice team/farm client) and structural (farm/practice-focused) changes. All practices reported at least one change goal initiated, with the majority (73%) reporting at least one fully implemented change. AMS implementation challenges included practical and cultural considerations of veterinary practices, the complexities of delivering AMS within inter-professional teams, the situated complexity of AMS on farm and the geographic, economic, regulatory, epidemiological and attitudinal factors implicit in the practice 'outer setting'. The Arwain complex intervention led to successful implementation of AMS changes across participating practices, with varying complexity, abstractness and completeness. Further research into the impact on antimicrobial use is needed to evaluate and inform future policy.",

Incidence rates of SSI are high in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with evidence of surge in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in these regions. This mini review aimed to collect and analyze existing data on SSI incidence and the associated AMR in LMICs to address some concerns about causes and control strategies. MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, AMED, Biosis, and CINAHL were all searched for this study until June 8, 2025. We included all studies comparing disparities in surgical site infections and related antimicrobial resistance in low- and middle-income countries. The overall SSI incidence in LMICs is higher than in high-income countries . The intertwined relationship between SSI and the rising AMR burden further complicates the issue. The emergence of AMR is driven by inappropriate antibiotic use, poor regulatory oversight and stewardship, inadequate healthcare infrastructure, economic limitations that result in incomplete or informal treatments, weak surveillance systems, and environmental contamination from hospitals, agriculture, and wastewater. Vaccination, sanitation and hygiene, infection control, education, alternative therapies consideration of, antimicrobial stewardship, and prevention, are strategies to prevent and reduce the development of AMR. AMR is a dire global problem that requires immediate action to combat its spread. Effective AMR surveillance from a \"One Health\" viewpoint is needed in LMICs to map and track the spread of resistance. Environmental resistome sample is required to detect the factors influencing resistance. Searching for solution to colistin resistance, a last resort antibiotic, is critical.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as a critical global health threat, undermining the effective treatment of infectious diseases. The growing challenge of antibiotic resistance is a matter of concern, driven by frequent misuse of antimicrobial agents and limited awareness among healthcare professionals. This study aimed to assess the level of antibiotic resistance awareness across diverse medical professionals in Kerala, India, and to identify demographic and contextual influences that affect awareness and stewardship practices. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 345 healthcare professionals, including doctors, dentists, nurses, and pharmacists across Kerala. Participants completed a validated 23-item Antibiotic Resistance Awareness Scale, supplemented with modules on demographics, formal training, and workplace factors. Data were analyzed to evaluate predictors of awareness scores. Participants demonstrated moderate to high overall AMR awareness (mean score 73.9 \u00b1 10.5), with the highest scores among physicians (75.8) and the lowest among nurses (69.7, p < 0.001). Significant disparities were observed by profession, training level, and practice setting. Only 23.5% reported formal AMR training, with pharmacists showing the highest training participation (44%). Males scored higher than females (mean difference 2.3, p=0.046), and practitioners in tertiary care had superior knowledge compared to those in primary care (mean difference 3.4, p=0.008). Training participation showed a positive but nonsignificant association with awareness (p=0.074). While overall awareness of antibiotic resistance among Kerala's healthcare professionals was good, substantial disparities exist, especially among nurses and those lacking formal AMR training. These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted educational programs, integrated stewardship curricula, and resource strengthening. Addressing these gaps is essential for successful AMR mitigation and for informing future policy and curricular reforms locally and in similar contexts globally.",

    "abstract": "The emergency department (ED) is increasingly recognized as a critical site for antimicrobial stewardship, where most initial antibiotic decisions occur, and emergency physicians (EPs), previously regarded as primarily focused on empiric treatment, are now emerging as leaders. Policy milestones, including accreditation standards and national guidelines, have catalyzed this transition, yet physician roles remain heterogeneous, and evidence on long-term outcomes is limited. Drawing on English-language literature, including intervention studies, descriptive reports, and policy documents, this editorial highlights how EPs contribute through guideline development, audit and feedback, culture follow-up, formulary oversight, rapid diagnostics, and educational initiatives. Evidence consistently shows improvements in prescribing appropriateness, reduced use of broad-spectrum agents, and faster optimization without compromising safety. However, barriers such as time pressure, professional culture, role ambiguity, and limited resources remain persistent. Importantly, the leadership of EPs has proven central in overcoming these obstacles, especially when supported by institutional commitment and integrated workflows. Their engagement is not only improving immediate prescribing practices but also represents a critical frontline defense against antimicrobial resistance and multidrug-resistant organisms. Looking forward, formalizing physician leadership, embedding stewardship in emergency medicine training, and building ED-specific data systems are essential to sustain safe and effective antibiotic use.",

Between April-December 2024, 182 pregnant women without urinary tract infection symptoms were screened at K\u0131r\u015fehir Training and Research Hospital. Midstream urine samples were cultured, and bacterial isolates were identified and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using the BD Phoenix\u2122 automated system. Data were interpreted according to EUCAST 2024 criteria. ASB prevalence was 37.36%.  ASB prevalence during second half of pregnancy was high, and a significant proportion of pathogens demonstrated MDR. The findings highlight the necessity of culture-based diagnosis and region-specific empirical therapy. High resistance to ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole suggests that empirical protocols should be updated according to local antibiograms.

This is a growing concern in the intensive care unit (ICU), particularly in regard to antibiotics. The aim of this study was to explore clinicians' awareness of RDE, its perceived causes, and potential strategies to reduce its occurrence. A qualitative approach using focus groups was conducted with ICU nurses, examining their awareness of RDE, contributing factors, and ideas for prevention. Thematic analysis was used to identify key themes and subthemes from the data. Twenty-seven participants participated in four focus groups over four mandatory training days. Clinicians' experiences with RDEs in the ICU were categorised into three main themes: (i) Awareness and perception of RDEs; (ii) Potential causes of RDE, including knowledge gaps, workload pressures, and inconsistent double-checking and documentation practices; and (iii) Proposed solutions to minimise RDEs including enhanced education, standardised protocols, and improved documentation. ICU nurses demonstrated limited prior awareness of RDE, with participants identifying multiple contributing factors including personal practice variability, drug characteristics, workload pressures, and reconstitution technique. Proposed solutions centred on targeted education, consistent double-checking and signing procedures, and concise, accessible checklists. These findings can inform the development of practical, context-appropriate strategies to improve medication accuracy and patient safety in the ICU.",

Inappropriate antimicrobial prescription and use exacerbate AMR. This study assesses the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) toward AMR and antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) among pharmacy healthcare workers involved in antimicrobial dispensing across 28 African countries. An online survey was distributed to collect data on KAP from HCWs who dispense antimicrobials in African countries. Responses were scored, and a 70% cut-off mark was used to differentiate between good and poor KAP. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with good or poor KAPs. A total of 2567 responses (40%) were received, of which 908 were from pharmacy HCWs who dispensed antibiotics in 28 countries. Of the 908 eligible respondents, 71.3% had good knowledge of AMR and AMS, 59.9% displayed good attitudes towards the burden of AMR and appropriate prescription of antimicrobials and 41.6% displayed good practices related to AMS. Patient demands and influence from pharmaceutical companies were among the factors that influenced the dispensing of antibiotics. In multivariable logistic regression, licensed pharmacists were more likely to have good knowledge of AMR than pharmacy technicians (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.78; 95%\u2009CI 1.64 to 1.93). Male dispensers were less likely to have a positive attitude towards AMR than female dispensers (aOR 0.69, 95%\u2009CI 0.51 to 0.94). Moreover, dispensers affiliated with public health facilities demonstrated better AMR practices than those affiliated with private facilities. Overall, good AMR knowledge status was significantly associated with positive attitudes (\u03c7\u00b2=97.1, p<0.001) and practices (\u03c7\u00b2=6.5, p<0.05) of AMR. This study revealed limited understanding of AMR among dispensers without formal pharmaceutical training and a positive association between good knowledge and positive attitudes and practices. The findings underscore the importance of providing workplace educational materials on AMR and AMS to build capacity in healthcare institutions and promote proper antibiotic dispensing.",

To improve rational prescribing, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed core prescribing indicators and the AWaRe antibiotic classification. Evidence from Afghanistan remains scarce, especially in outpatient settings. This cross-sectional prescription audit was conducted from June to December 2024 in six public and private hospitals in Kabul. Prescriptions were sampled from outpatient departments of internal medicine, pediatrics, surgery, and ENT. Of 623 prescriptions screened, 306 (49.1%) contained at least one antibiotic and were analyzed using WHO prescribing indicators and the AWaRe classification. Data were processed with SPSS v25. A total of 374 antibiotics were prescribed, with an average of 1.5 per prescription. The most common agents were ceftriaxone (19.9%), metronidazole (16.0%), ciprofloxacin (12.4%), and amoxicillin (11.4%). Generic prescribing accounted for 63.3%, while 42.7% of prescriptions included parenteral antibiotics. All antibiotics were from the National Essential Medicines List. AWaRe analysis showed Watch antibiotics (58.6%) predominated, while Access antibiotics (41.4%) were underused; no Reserve antibiotics were prescribed. No culture and sensitivity testing supported prescribing. Antibiotic prescribing in Kabul outpatient settings substantially exceeded WHO standards, with high reliance on broad-spectrum Watch-group agents, injectables, and non-generic formulations. These findings underscore the urgent need for Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs, prescriber training, and improved diagnostic capacity to ensure rational antibiotic use and contain AMR in Afghanistan.",

Survey questions were readapted from the WHO IPC assessment framework (IPCAF), PNCAR and INSIEME group proposals, resulting in 155 questions grouped into six sections: IPC program, surveillance, control activities for healthcare-associated infections, antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) strategies, IPC training and education, and monitoring indicators. Thirty-eight acute care Hospitals completed the survey (response rate: 30%): 26.3% of hospitals did not define an annual program and 34.2% an AMS task force. Periodic microbiology reports were available for 57.9%, hospital alcohol-based hand rubs consumption per 1000 bed-days in 42.1% and defined daily dose of antimicrobials per 100 bed-days in 55.3% hospitals with a significant difference between Northern and Southern regions (90.9% vs 22.2%; P\u2009=\u20090.006).

    "abstract": "Excessive use of postoperative prophylactic antibiotics in children's hospitals is a significant public health concern, leading to increased risks of infections like Clostridioides difficile, multidrug-resistant organisms, and unnecessary healthcare costs. Antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs) are designed to optimize antibiotic use, but ideal strategies for implementing evidence-based guidelines remain unclear. We tested facilitation, a dynamic process where trained individuals support healthcare personnel in bridging evidence-practice gaps, as a promising strategy for the de-implementation of unnecessary postoperative antibiotics in healthcare. The OPerAtiC trial employed a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled design across nine hospitals to compare the effectiveness of two ASP-led strategies, specifically order set changes to align with antibiotic guidelines (baseline arm) and facilitation training (intervention arm). Facilitation workshops were informed by the i-PARIHS framework, emphasizing context analysis, evidence application, and recipient engagement; and were conducted remotely. Data were collected from 2019 to 2024, involving interviews with stewardship team members every two months. Data collected included proximal implementation outcomes of each ASP team member (acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness), intermediate outcomes (facilitation skill use) reported by the ASP team, and order set change completion rates. Proximal implementation outcomes for both strategies were rated high across all study phases, indicating strong baseline enthusiasm among participants (N\u2009=\u200930). Key facilitation skills-effective communication, conflict resolution, and data presentation-were pivotal for successful implementation. Most order set changes (76%) were completed post-facilitation, targeting various specialties and achieving reductions or eliminations in antibiotic use. Facilitation was associated with significantly more completed order sets targeting antibiotic reduction (p\u2009=\u20090.01), suggesting a potential pathway to improve the appropriateness of antibiotic use through implementation strategies. Facilitation is a valuable approach in refining ASP efforts, contributing to the successful reduction and de-implementation of unnecessary antibiotic use in children's hospitals. The study underscores the need for ongoing training and support for ASP teams to enhance their effectiveness in promoting appropriate antibiotic-prescribing practices. Future research should explore the long-term impacts of facilitation on antibiotic stewardship and patient outcomes.

    "abstract": "To explore the perceptions of European nursing home staff regarding factors influencing the prevention of urinary tract infections and antimicrobial stewardship. This qualitative descriptive study was conducted between July and September 2023. In each of eight European countries-Denmark, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain-five semi-structured interviews were carried out with nursing home staff, resulting in a total of 40 interviews. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using systematic text condensation. Factors perceived to influence infection prevention and antibiotic stewardship were organized into five themes: (1) residents, including the respect for their autonomy, (2) relatives, including their demands for investigations and treatment, (3) physicians, including their attitudes towards antibiotics, (4) staff, including their challenging working conditions and lack of education, and (5) the nursing home environment in which these four actors navigate. Nursing home staff perceive multiple factors influencing infection prevention, including the challenge of balancing respect for residents' autonomy with maintaining high hygiene standards. A key barrier to effective antimicrobial stewardship appears to be a lack of staff awareness regarding their crucial role in the process.",

    "abstract": "Background Overprescription of antibiotics in febrile children contributes significantly to antimicrobial resistance. Point-of-care testing (POCT) for C-reactive protein (CRP) may help differentiate bacterial from viral infections and support more rational antibiotic use. Objective To assess the effectiveness of POCT CRP testing in reducing antibiotic prescription rates among febrile children in an outpatient pediatric setting. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Maharashtra, India, involving 208 children aged one month to 18 years with febrile illness (\u22645 days). Participants were randomized into two groups: Group 1 (n=106) received POCT CRP testing, and Group 2 (n=102) received standard clinical care. CRP was measured using the LumiraDx\u00a0fluorescence immunoassay (LumiraDx UK Ltd, Alloa, UK). The primary outcome was the rate of antibiotic prescription. Results Antibiotic prescription was significantly higher in Group 1 (59.4%) than in Group 2 (46.1%) (p=0.023). Within the POCT group, 84.2% of children with CRP >20 mg/L were prescribed antibiotics compared to 45.6% with CRP \u226420 mg/L (p=0.0001). Elevated CRP levels were significantly associated with antibiotic prescription, especially in cases of fever and abdominal pain. Conclusion POCT CRP influenced physicians' prescribing decisions, particularly when CRP levels exceeded 20 mg/L. However, without structured integration into clinical algorithms, its use alone did not reduce overall antibiotic use. Physician training and adherence to CRP-based guidance are essential to optimize the benefits of POCT CRP in antimicrobial stewardship.",

    "authors": "Lynch C",
    "year": 2025,
    "journal": "Cureus",
    "abstract": "Introduction Antibiotic stewardship is becoming critically important as resistant bacteria become increasingly prevalent. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as a major global health challenge, driven in part by the misuse and overuse of antibiotics. An acute sore throat is one of the most frequent reasons for patients to seek medical care, yet only a minority of cases require antibiotic treatment. Despite this, inappropriate prescribing is rife, often influenced by diagnostic uncertainty, patient expectations, and non-clinical pressures. These challenges highlight the importance of reinforcing evidence-based strategies, such as the use of Centor criteria, to support accurate assessment and reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing in patients presenting with a sore throat. This quality improvement project evaluated adherence to Centor criteria and subsequent antibiotic prescribing in an accident and emergency (A&E) department in the Northwest of England, before and after clinician education on NICE guidance and documentation of Centor criteria. Materials and methods One hundred patients presenting with an acute sore throat between January and March 2023 were identified. Electronic patient data were collected retrospectively to analyze the documentation's adherence to NICE guidelines and Modified Centor criteria. Results Pre-intervention, 16% of clinicians documented all Centor criteria, 48% incorrectly prescribed antibiotics, and only 20% prescribed appropriate antibiotics. Through post-intervention teaching and literature dissemination, the figures changed to 54%, 22%, and 56%, respectively. Conclusion Targeted clinician education and adherence to NICE guidelines improved antibiotic prescribing for the acute sore throat, underscoring the value of audit cycles while highlighting the need for sustained, larger-scale efforts to reduce AMR.",

This qualitative study examined communication between infection control workers and pharmacists at MOH hospitals through semi-structured interviews ( This study identified four key themes from 9 participants (6 male, 3 female) regarding antimicrobial stewardship communication challenges: (1) Patient Safety & Communication - emphasizing protocol adherence, interdisciplinary rounds, and preference for formal channels over WhatsApp; (2) Interdisciplinary Collaboration - where leadership engagement and face-to-face committees enhanced decision-making; (3) Healthcare Delivery Challenges - particularly staffing shortages, excessive workloads, and unclear medication protocols; and (4) Training & Development - revealing gaps in feedback systems, limited educational resources, and reactive crisis communication. Critical findings included the need for structured antibiotic monitoring, COO-level support for stewardship programs, resolution of role ambiguities, and implementation of proactive training initiatives to optimize infection control practices. Structured communication\u2014through regular meetings, stewardship rounds, and clear antibiotic guidelines\u2014significantly enhanced infection control outcomes by fostering collaboration between pharmacists and infection control teams. This approach improved adherence to protocols, optimized antibiotic use, and strengthened emergency preparedness, directly contributing to patient safety. However, persistent challenges like staffing shortages and training gaps must be addressed to maximize these benefits.

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a critical global health threat, exacerbated by inappropriate dispensing practices. Despite efforts to improve antimicrobial stewardship, behavioral determinants influencing antimicrobial dispensing remain understudied, particularly in low-resource settings like Ethiopia. This study was aimed to explore the behavioral drivers of antimicrobial dispensing among pharmacy professionals working at community drug retail outlets of Addis Ababa. This convergent, parallel mixed-methods study was conducted in three randomly selected sub-cities of Addis Ababa from March to May 2025. The quantitative component addressed the prevalence and predictors of dispensing behavior, surveying 240 pharmacy professionals selected via multi-stage sampling from 120 drug retail outlets. Data were collected using digital (Google Forms) and paper-based questionnaires, measuring TDF-based behavioral determinants and dispensing behavior. Participants were pharmacists and druggists with at least three months of dispensing experience, selected from private pharmacies and drug stores. Hierarchical multiple regression and confirmatory factor analysis were performed using SPSS and AMOS. The qualitative component explored contextual nuances through in-depth interviews with 16 professionals until thematic saturation, analyzed using Dedoose software with a thematic approach, without a predefined framework to allow free expression of feelings. Data quality was ensured through pre-testing, digital validation, and transcription cross-checking. Quantitative findings revealed inappropriate dispensing in 53.75% of cases (129/240). One-sample t-tests showed significant positive deviations for most TDF domains (p\u2009<\u2009.001), except environmental context (p\u2009=\u2009.642). Hierarchical regression indicated demographic and behavioral factors explained 62% of dispensing behavior variance, with age (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.630, p\u2009<\u2009.001), female gender (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.343, p\u2009<\u2009.001), and behavioral factors; (Professional Role and Self-Regulation: \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.456, p\u2009<\u2009.001; Emotional and Social Dynamics: (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.359, p\u2009<\u2009.001)) as positive predictors, while Skills and Belief Systems (\u03b2=-0.431, p\u2009<\u2009.001) and experience (\u2265\u20095 years) negatively predicted appropriate dispensing (\u03b2=-0.304, p\u2009<\u2009.001). Qualitative insights highlighted systemic barriers, including patient pressure, profit motives, and weak regulatory enforcement, which often overrode professional knowledge. Triangulation revealed that while pharmacists understood guidelines, workplace pressures and financial incentives drove non-compliance. Inappropriate antimicrobial dispensing was prevalent and significantly influenced by key determinants: longer experience negatively predicted appropriate dispensing, while female gender positively predicted it. Behavioral factors, particularly social and commercial pressures like patient demand and competition, were stronger drivers than knowledge alone.",

    "abstract": "Infection prevention and control (IPC) and antibiotic stewardship (ABS) represent promising approaches for reducing the prevalence of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in different healthcare settings. However, the combined use of IPC and ABS measures and ways to optimize their integrated implementation have been insufficiently considered and assessed. The REVERSE trial, funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 program, involves 24 acute care hospitals from four European countries, all with high rates of AMR and HAI. REVERSE aims to investigate whether the sequential implementation of an IPC and an ABS practice bundle is feasible and sustainable and whether externally guided tailoring as an enhanced implementation strategy leads to superior clinical and implementation outcomes compared to a basic implementation condition. REVERSE will be designed as a stepped wedge cluster randomized, hybrid type 2 trial, including an embedded implementation trial. Four cohorts of six acute care hospitals will sequentially enter the trial over 38\u00a0months and work to implement first IPC, and, after 1\u00a0year, add the ABS practice bundle. Simultaneously, hospitals will be provided basic implementation training and instructed to tailor their implementation, with half of the hospitals being self-guided in their tailoring, whereas hospitals in the enhanced implementation condition will receive time-limited external facilitation in practicing tailoring. Qualitative data will be collected longitudinally to investigate contextual conditions for implementing IPC and ABS locally and how they contribute to tailoring results. IPC and ABS feasibility, fidelity, and sustainability will be assessed together with tailoring fidelity using repeated measures. Retrospective, in-depth, explanatory case studies will be conducted to interpret hospital outcomes. REVERSE is an extensive and complex effectiveness-implementation trial aimed at investigating tailoring effectiveness. It will contribute to the still scarce evidence base for this adaptive approach to integrating research-supported interventions into routine healthcare settings. By identifying pathways toward strengthening the integration of IPC and ABS practices at European acute care hospitals, REVERSE also has the potential to inform much-needed concerted efforts to combat the growing challenge of antimicrobial resistance in the region. In November 2021, the REVERSE study was registered with the \"International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number\" (ISRCTN) register under nr.12956554.",

However, research on the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) in Chinese ICUs is limited. This study aimed to assess the impact of ASP implementation on antibiotic use and bacterial resistance in a Chinese ICU. \u00a0This retrospective, interventional study employed an interrupted time series design and was conducted in an ICU beginning on June 1, 2019. The ASP included the formation of a multidisciplinary team, the development of facility-specific criteria, prescriber education, the implementation of preauthorization processes, and retrospective prescription audit and feedback (RPAF). Patient data were collected from June 1, 2018, to May 31, 2020. An interrupted time series analysis was used to evaluate the impact of the ASP. A total of 862 patients were admitted during the pre-intervention period, and 946 patients were admitted during the post-intervention period.

Additionally, a decrease in the incidence of bacteremia caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms overall (\u03b23:-0.03 events/100 PD, p\u2009=\u20090.036) and MDR Gram-positive organisms (\u03b23:-0.01 events/100 PD, p\u2009=\u20090.002) was observed post-intervention. Reduced antimicrobial consumption and decreased incidence of infections associated with MDR organisms were observed following the implementation of an ASP strategy that incorporated clinical pharmacists as core team members.

    "abstract": "Multidrug-resistant urinary tract infections (MDR UTIs) are a growing concern in patients with brain and spinal cord injuries due to their high susceptibility to UTIs and repeated antibiotic exposure. This study aimed to develop and externally validate a machine learning model for predicting MDR UTIs in patients with brain and spinal cord injuries. We retrospectively analyzed 849 patients with brain or spinal cord injuries and culture-confirmed UTIs. Data from a single institution were used for model training, and the other served as an external test set. Five machine learning models and ensemble models were trained and evaluated. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The finally selected ensemble model, combining Naive Bayes and Random Forest, achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.8425, with an accuracy of 0.7688, sensitivity of 0.7647, specificity of 0.7697, positive predictive value of 0.4262, and negative predictive value of 0.9360. Important predictors included recent antibiotic use, total Functional Independence Measure score, neutrophil-to-platelet ratio, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, age, hematocrit, hemoglobin, serum protein, serum albumin, and urethral indwelling catheter. Externally validated, the model showed consistent performance across institutions. It may support early MDR risk stratification in patients with brain and spinal cord injuries. Early identification of at-risk individuals may guide antibiotic stewardship in neurorehabilitation settings.",

An a priori sample size of 30 National Health Service staff and 10 patient interviews was selected to elicit information relating to the aims. Interview schedules were developed, and all interviews were conducted via video or teleconferencing between December 2021 and December 2022 and lasted between 10 and 60 minutes. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 National Health Service clinicians and seven patients and legal representatives. National Health Service staff were risk-averse to stopping empirical antifungal therapy, especially if the patient was improving, while patients were risk-neutral. Although there is a clear unmet need for new rapid testing strategy, clinical confidence in its accuracy, clinical utility, cost-effectiveness and usability were strong factors for its consideration for use in decision-making and adoption. Patients did not exhibit strong feelings towards stopping empirical antifungal treatment as they expressed reliance on clinical judgement. There was a potential for selection bias as interview participants being from participating sites. The target recruitment numbers of patients and their legal representatives was not achieved due to low retention rates. If found to have high accuracy and cost-effectiveness, the potential of the Antifungal STewardship Opportunities diagnostic strategy to aid decision-making on antifungal prescribing could change intensive care unit clinicians practice, as they are risk-averse to stopping empirical antifungal treatment. However, consideration of the resources needed including staff, and lab facilities, adequate training as well as established guidelines to facilitate its adoption is required. Our next aim is to use Antifungal STewardship Opportunities results to inform the update of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines and explore schemes such as the Accelerated Access Collaborative and MedTech funding mandate to propel the adoption of this testing strategy. This article presents independent research funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme as award number 15/116/03. Invasive candidiasis is a serious fungal infection of the blood or other organs which can lead to death, especially in critically ill patients. Diagnosing this infection involves a lengthy process which takes up to 2 days or more. Due to the risks of starting treatment late, doctors often start treatment with antifungal medications before having results available. Faster diagnosis is crucial for efficient antimicrobial stewardship and to reduce unnecessary use of potentially toxic and costly drugs. Antifungal STewardship Opportunities study is investigating the use of rapid tests to improve how we diagnose invasive candidiasis in the United Kingdom. \u2018Stewardship\u2019 is about responsible use of medications that fight off infections. It is believed that these tests will help physicians make the decision on whether antifungal drugs are needed in a timelier way. Our objective was to understand the risk preferences of patients and physicians in using the Antifungal STewardship Opportunities testing strategy for stopping or modifying medications prescribed before test results were available. The study involved interviews with 21 National Health Service staff members and seven patients or their legal representatives, conducted between December 2021 and December 2022. The results of the interviews indicated that National Health Service clinicians were generally reluctant to take the risks of stopping the use of antifungal medications if the patient\u2019s health conditions improved. Patients trusted their physicians in their decision to continue or stop the treatment. All agreed that there is the need for a quicker, cost-effective, reliable and easy-to-use test. These factors would increase the likelihood for the test to be adopted. To assess the potential of the test, National Health Service needs to have staff and lab capacity to deliver on faster turnaround times. If the Antifungal STewardship Opportunities diagnostic strategy is proven effective, the development of guidelines to support its implementation in National Health Service will follow.",

    "abstract": "The World Health Organization identified 13 critical threats to global health for the coming decade, including infectious disease prevention and antimicrobial resistance. Given the ongoing advancements in scientific evidence, it is imperative to discuss the Infectious Diseases training program. The aim of this study was to characterize and explore the respondents' perceptions regarding Infectious Diseases training and the clinical learning environment. A survey was developed to assess the clinical learning environment, targeting residents and young specialists who completed their training within the past five years. The questionnaire received 73 responses, 75.3% from residents. Most respondents agreed with the duration of Internal Medicine (83.5%), Microbiology (76.7%), and General Infectious Diseases (71.2%) rotations, but considered that the Intensive Care rotation should last less than six months. The areas of Infection Control/Antibiotic Stewardship and Immunosuppression/Infectious Risk were suggested as mandatory rotations by 84.9% and 65.8% of participants, respectively. Most respondents (67.1%) considered prolonged Internal Medicine Emergency rotations beyond the first year detrimental. In contrast, 84.6% of ARS Norte participants only performed this activity during the first year, whereas 86.8% of ARS LVT participants continued, at least, until the fourth year. Regarding clinical and scientific output, ARS Norte interns reported, on average, higher numbers of weekly assisted (21.7 vs 17.1) and performed (20.8 vs 17.7) appointments, as well as higher annual participation (3.7 vs 3.1) and presentations (2.8 vs 2.4) in scientific events, published articles (1.1 vs 0.6), and weekly study hours (7.4 vs 4.5), compared with ARS LVT. The main challenges reported were a lack of dedicated study time during working hours, scientific updates, and clinical practice in Internal Medicine Emergency rotations. Regarding the evaluation of the residency program, only 2.7% agreed completely with the current exam model and 1.37% with the current curriculum grid. The majority (64.4%) of participants considered themselves at least satisfied with the specialty. The results suggest a need to review the Infectious Diseases training program, include new areas of specialization, and discuss evaluation models throughout residency. Regional asymmetries were observed in emergency work, clinical and scientific output, which affect the equity and quality of training. Discussion of the Infectious Diseases training program is crucial for adapting the curriculum to current and future challenges.

    "abstract": "Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) affects approximately 75% of women globally, with a particularly high prevalence (30-45%) among women of reproductive age in Uganda. Over-the-counter (OTC) antifungal medications are a critical access point for treatment in resource-limited settings; however, their unregulated availability raises important questions regarding appropriate use, diagnostic accuracy, and antimicrobial stewardship. We aimed to analyze Uganda's regulatory framework governing OTC antifungal medications for VVC management, identify key policy gaps, and develop an evidence-based framework to balance accessibility with appropriate use. This study employed a documentary analysis of Ugandan pharmaceutical policy documents (2000-2025) combined with a systematic review of the published literature on medication regulation and self-medication practices. A structured policy analysis framework was applied to examine the classification systems, implementation mechanisms, and provision of oversight for antifungal medications. Uganda's current regulatory framework increases antifungal accessibility through liberal OTC classification but neglects complementary measures to ensure appropriate use and safety. Five critical policy gaps were identified: (i) diagnostic accuracy: no provisions ensure proper differentiation of VVC from other conditions; (ii) treatment completion: no mechanisms ensure adherence to recommended treatment durations; (iii) safety screening: absence of pregnancy screening requirements for contraindicated fluconazole; (iv) personnel training, inadequate VVC-specific training for drug shop operators; and (v) product regulation: insufficient oversight of combination products. These gaps exist within the healthcare context, where 62% of antimicrobials are supplied by private vendors with minimal oversight. We propose an evidence-based framework that balances accessibility with appropriate use. The identified policy gaps potentially compromise women's health outcomes through inappropriate treatment, incomplete therapy courses, preventable medication risks, and conditions that favor the development of antifungal resistance. The policy tensions between accessibility and appropriate use highlight the need for gender-sensitive pharmaceutical regulations that maintain access while implementing targeted safeguards for improved health outcomes and antimicrobial stewardship.",

From July to December 2022, we conducted focus groups with 31 dentists from Spain Data were analysed using thematic analysis with a pragmatic orientation to address the research objectives. Inclusion criteria required participants to be dentistry graduates or oral medicine specialists (stomatologists) and actively working as dentists. The sample was selected through key informants and the snowball method. We ensured methodological quality by adhering to the COREQ checklist. We formed seven synchronous online focus groups with 31 participants. Dentists acknowledged the problem of antibiotic resistance, identifying fear, working conditions and burnout and patient trust as factors contributing to inappropriate prescribing. Despite this awareness, dentists did not see themselves as key agents of change in combating antibiotic resistance. However, they expressed interest in further education on the topic. These findings underscore the need for educational interventions that highlight dentists' role in antimicrobial stewardship. By situating these interventions within the One Health framework, dentists can be empowered to translate their leadership in oral health into active participation in the prudent use of antibiotics. Strengthening this role has practical implications for multidisciplinary strategies to combat antimicrobial resistance.",

This was a retrospective analysis of patients with bloodstream infection due to Enterobacterales attended at Hospital Infantil de Mexico during 2013-2019. Factors influencing mortality were assessed. The baseline characteristics of the population, bloodstream infection and antimicrobial treatment were compared between survivors and non-survivors as well. Of 527 cases of BSIs, 63.6% (n=335) were caused by Enterobacterales and 307 cases were included. The overall mortality rate was 11.1% (n=34). In the multivariable regression model, septic shock/multiorgan failure (HR 9.69, 95% CI: 3.28-28.63), and empirical treatment failure (HR 3.4, 95% CI: 1.36-8.45) were associated with an increased mortality risk. in this study, the mortality in pediatric BSIs was driven by severe clinical presentation and failure to control inflammatory response and infection. Improving outcomes requires proactive measures, including early detection of sepsis by caregivers, education of healthcare providers for timely recognition and treatment, vigilant monitoring of systemic inflammatory response with adaptable therapeutic approaches and reinforcement of antimicrobial stewardship programs.",

This study evaluates ASP structure in UAE hospitals for seven core elements defined by Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organisation (WHO). A mixed-methods approach across 12 Emirates Health Services (EHS) hospitals, included document reviews, surveys, and expert interviews. Document evaluation was performed on a 3-point Likert scale. Online surveys distributed to a random sample of 385 employees, evaluated ASP dissemination using a 5-point Likert scale, analysed descriptively and through Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests (P<0.05) using SPSS. Interviews with programme experts were thematically analysed using NVIVO. Document analysis showed 6 of 7 ASP core elements fully met, with accountability partially met in all hospitals. The survey (83% response rate) revealed partial ASP dissemination (median = 4, IQR=2) across all elements, with significant differences between employee groups and hospitals (P=0.032). Interviews with 12 ASP experts identified key programme facilitators to be leadership, active interventions, pharmacist engagement, and tailored education. Barriers were inconsistent antibiotic tracking, physician resistance, lack of rapid diagnostics, competency framework and cadre training. EHS ASP demonstrates adequate structure but inconsistent dissemination across hospitals. This first UAE mixed-methods study benchmarks local ASP against CDC and WHO standards, aligning with high-income countries but diverging from practices in Middle East and North African countries. ASP implementation and adoption optimisation needs to be explored with process and outcome indicator data focusing on prescribing, cost-effectiveness and clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance poses a growing global health threat and is largely driven by the inappropriate use of antibiotics. Primary healthcare institutions, particularly in low-resource settings, often face challenges, such as limited oversight and irrational prescribing practices. While progress has been made in improving antibiotic stewardship in higher-level hospitals, efforts to optimize prescription in primary healthcare institutions remain insufficient. The County Medical Community Central Pharmacy (CMCP) program was introduced as an integrated intervention to enhance pharmacy services and promote rational antibiotic use through centralized oversight, training, and pharmacist collaboration. This multicenter quasi-experimental study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the CMCP program in reducing antibiotic misuse and improving prescribing rationality in primary healthcare institutions in Shandong Province, China. This multicenter quasi-experimental study was conducted between July and December 2023 in six geographically and economically diverse rural regions of Shandong Province. A total of 37 primary healthcare institutions were included, with 25 voluntarily implementing the CMCP program (intervention group) and 12 continuing routine practices (control group). Data were collected at two time points via structured questionnaires and reviews of 100 randomly selected outpatient prescriptions from each primary healthcare institution. A difference-in-differences (DID) regression model was applied to estimate the impact of the intervention on antibiotic usage and irrational prescribing, controlling for institutional and staffing characteristics. Antibiotic usage rates increased in both groups, but to a lesser extent in the intervention group (from 15.726 to 18.732%; P\u2009=\u20090.006) than in the control group (from 17.682 to 26.582%; P\u2009<\u20090.001). DID analysis showed a mitigating effect on antibiotic use (DID coefficient\u2009=\u2009-\u00a00.061; P\u2009=\u20090.054). Irrational antibiotic use in the intervention group decreased from 50.660 to 27.655% (P\u2009<\u20090.001), whereas it remained largely unchanged in the control group (36.893% vs. 35.238%). The CMCP program was effective in curbing unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions and enhancing prescription quality in primary healthcare institutions. These findings support the continued implementation and scale-up of CMCP as a strategy to strengthen antibiotic stewardship at the primary care level in resource-limited settings.",

Clinical staff are responsible for cleaning medical equipment and some aspects of the healthcare environment. To improve the clinical cleaning on a busy PICU in a tertiary referral hospital in England. This was an educational continuous Quality Improvement (QI) project using opportunistic and targeted one-to-one education and training for clinical staff. Cleaning audits were conducted weekly throughout the study period and the results mapped against monthly bed occupancy data. The PDSA cycle (plan, do, study, act) was used to review actions, outcomes, and impact and consider further work every month by the study team. Key themes emerged for improvement around the training delivered on cleaning, both formally through mandatory study days and informally through the cascade of knowledge to new starters. The cleaning 'hotspots' identified via audit and how these were communicated to the team were also targeted. The multi-mode interventions, delivered by both Infection Prevention link nurse unit staff and a Clinical Auditor/ Educator, were successful in building and maintaining excellent cleaning standards within the ward. Co-creation of cleaning interventions enabled a supportive environment to be developed with staff demonstrating a high level of understanding and commitment to environmental cleanliness. This approach would be scalable across multiple areas of the hospital with the short-term support of a Clinical Educator or Infection Prevention Nurse.",

    "abstract": "Early-onset sepsis (EOS) remains a leading cause of mortality and neurodevelopmental injury in preterm infants, yet widely used tools (e.g., Kaiser EOS Calculator) are not designed for <35-37 weeks' gestation. To develop and internally validate a concise, clinically interpretable nomogram for EOS risk stratification in preterm neonates and to evaluate its potential for antibiotic stewardship. We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study (July 2023-June 2024) including 1,059 preterm infants admitted within 72\u2009h of birth, randomly split 7:3 into training (n\u2009=\u2009742) and validation (n\u2009=\u2009317). Forty-five maternal and neonatal candidates were screened (univariable tests, LASSO), followed by multivariable logistic regression to build the final model and nomogram. Discrimination (AUC), calibration (Brier score, calibration curve, Hosmer-Lemeshow), and decision-curve analysis (DCA) were assessed; two biologically plausible interactions were prespecified. Four routinely available variables-gestational age, birth weight, umbilical cord abnormality, and mechanical ventilation within 72 h-composed the final model. In the validation cohort, AUC was 0.818 (95% CI, 0.767-0.868), Brier score 0.158, and Hosmer-Lemeshow P\u2009=\u20090.71; DCA showed net benefit across 5-65% risk thresholds. Using a\u2009\u2265\u20090.70 treatment threshold, the model identified 88% of EOS cases while recommending antibiotics for ~10% of infants. A culture-proven-only sensitivity analysis yielded comparable discrimination (AUC 0.819) with a Brier score 0.041. A four-factor nomogram using EMR-available variables accurately stratifies EOS risk in preterm infants and may support risk-based antibiotic decisions while limiting overtreatment. Prospective multicenter external validation is warranted to confirm generalizability and guide implementation.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) education plays a vital role in addressing antimicrobial resistance (AMR), yet its long-term impact on behavior and clinical outcomes remains underexplored. Educational interventions are often assessed through knowledge-based outcomes, with limited evaluation of sustained practice changes or patient-level results, and standardized higher-level outcome measures across diverse healthcare settings. This scoping review aimed to map pre-post AMS healthcare educational interventions using the Kirkpatrick Model, evaluating their effectiveness across its four levels: reaction, learning, behavior, and results. The goal was to identify trends, highlight gaps, and provide insight into reported outcomes, delivery methods, and evaluation tools, supporting future research and strengthening the evidence base for AMS education. This review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute framework. A literature search of nine databases identified studies from 2010 to 2024. Eligible studies included pre-post AMS educational interventions targeting undergraduate students and healthcare professionals (HCPs) and reporting outcomes which were subsequently mapped by the reviewers to the Kirkpatrick Model. Data were categorized by target population, delivery format, and evaluation tools. Narrative synthesis was used to describe trends and relationships. Studies targeted HCPs such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and dental professionals, and undergraduate students in pharmacy, medicine, nursing, and dentistry. Sixty-three studies were included. Outcomes were distributed across Level 1 (Reaction) (n\u2009=\u200946, 24%), Level 2 (Learning) (n\u2009=\u200951, 27%), Level 3 (Behavior) (n\u2009=\u200950, 26%), and Level 4 (Results) (n\u2009=\u200945, 23%). While n\u2009=\u200924 (38%) assessed all four levels, another n\u2009=\u200924 (38%) reported mixed or partial levels. Face-to-face or online-only formats achieved Levels 1 and 2. Whereas blended or workplace-integrated interventions more often demonstrated behavior change and clinical outcomes (Levels 3 and 4). Longitudinal follow-up and mixed evaluation tools (e.g., surveys, chart reviews, interviews) supported higher-level impacts. Pharmacy-led, interdisciplinary, and contextually tailored interventions mapped to all levels. AMS education often leads to short-term learning gains, but fewer interventions achieve sustained behavior change or measurable clinical outcomes. Blended and practice-integrated formats, paired with long-term evaluation, are key to realizing the full potential of AMS education. Embedding such approaches in undergraduate and professional programs can better prepare the future HCPs to address AMR effectively.",

As part of integrated community case management (iCCM) programs, CHW frequently diagnose and treat acute respiratory illness (ARI), a leading cause of pediatric mortality and indication for antibiotic use globally. Yet knowledge and perceptions of antibiotic prescribing for ARI among CHW are not well-studied. The goal of this study was to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to antibiotics among CHW implementing a stepped-wedge trial of an enhanced iCCM algorithm for children with ARI in rural Uganda to inform future antimicrobial stewardship strategies. We conducted a nested mixed methods study with a convergent parallel design, administering surveys before and after the stepped wedge trial and individual semi-structured interviews at study end. We employed descriptive statistics, Wilcoxan rank sum tests, and thematic content analysis methods. A total of 63 of 67 (94.0%) CHW completed both baseline and follow-up surveys, and 15 CHW were interviewed. The median age of the full cohort was 40 (IQR: 35\u201347) years with 9.5 years of CHW experience (IQR: 4.0\u201314.0 years). Almost all CHW (95.2%) identified amoxicillin as an antibiotic at baseline, and most associated antibiotics with treating bacterial diseases (baseline: 82.5%, follow-up: 93.7%,  CHW were overall familiar with antibiotics and their potential harms. They were eager to gain knowledge regarding AMS and AMR and share it with their communities. CHW represent an underutilized resource for AMS interventions and should be included in their design and implementation.

Podcasts are convenient, accessible, and may be effective education tools for listeners. While some studies have attempted to measure the effectiveness of podcasting to enhance knowledge, there are few studies evaluating podcasts in pharmacy education. The purpose of this project was to provide students with the opportunity to create a podcast episode through an in-class, semester-long assignment and to evaluate student perceptions of knowledge, confidence, and professional identity. Over the course of a semester-long elective class, students worked in groups to develop a 10-min podcast episode on an infectious diseases topic. Students were tasked with creating, recording, and editing content for individual episodes. The podcast episodes were evaluated on accuracy, summary and impact of clinical studies, and production quality. At the end of the semester, a podcast was launched on publicly available platforms and the student podcast episodes were made available for listening. At the conclusion of the semester, students were surveyed on perceived anxiety, confidence, knowledge, and support surrounding the podcast project. Students indicated a notable increase in confidence and knowledge after completing the podcast project. All students were proud of the podcast episode they created and most indicated plans to listen to and share these podcast episodes with others. The creation of a semester-long, student-driven class podcast project is feasible and promotes learning and engagement. Students reported increased confidence, knowledge, and professional pride after completing their podcast episodes.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a significant global health threat, which is worsened by the inappropriate distribution of antibiotics without a prescription. Cultural conventions and the easy accessibility of pharmacies in Saudi Arabia further aggravate this situation. Community pharmacists play a crucial role in antimicrobial stewardship, yet they continue to face substantial challenges. The objective of this study was to examine the barriers and determinants that influence community pharmacists' capability to reduce over-the-counter (OTC) antibiotic sales in the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 269 community pharmacists, utilizing a validated, self-administered questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and ordinal logistic regression to assess associations between demographic characteristics and pharmacists' views of obstacles and stewardship practices. The type of pharmacy was significantly associated with perceived barriers ( The study highlights that systemic and educational factors strongly influence pharmacists' roles in antimicrobial stewardship. This indicates that targeted interventions such as continuous professional education, digital prescription monitoring, and stronger regulatory enforcement are necessary to support pharmacists and reduce the dispensing of inappropriate antibiotics. These measures also align with Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 healthcare priorities. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate these barriers within the Aseer region, offering novel evidence on how organizational and educational contexts shape stewardship practices.

This study explores a novel pharmacist working model (resident pharmacists) and evaluates its effectiveness to provide evidence for optimizing pharmaceutical services in intensive care units (ICUs). From February 2024 to January 2025, resident pharmacists were embedded within the Liver ICU as part of a pilot program, delivering multidisciplinary pharmaceutical services including clinical care, teaching, research, and management. Specialized interventions targeting pediatric and infectious disease populations were implemented based on departmental needs. A retrospective analysis was conducted over 12\u00a0months to assess the impact of resident pharmacists on pharmaceutical indicators, service quality, and staff satisfaction; key outcome measures included cost reduction, prescribing appropriateness, and antibiotic use metrics. All pharmaceutical management metrics met institutional standards in 2024-2025, including Antibiotic Use Density (AUD; 112.30 vs. threshold 120.47), antimicrobial usage rate (78.68% vs. 88.54%), and proton pump inhibitor prescription rationality (100%). Pharmacists conducted 78 clinical consultations (65.38% multidisciplinary), addressed 132 medication inquiries, developed two clinical guidelines, and achieved full satisfaction scores from medical staff. The average drug cost per patient decreased by 20.05% (RMB 28,806 vs. 36,028 in 2023), with drug cost proportion declining from 30.85% to 23.59%. By deeply participating in various aspects of drug use in the wards, including medical work, management, scientific research cooperation, continuing medical education, resident pharmacists provided more high-quality pharmaceutical services and promote the improvement of pharmaceutical quality control indicators. Resident pharmacists have become important members of the medical team responsible for medication safety and optimizing treatment plans.",

    "abstract": "The Danish primary care sector is responsible for the majority of antibiotic prescriptions, with upper respiratory tract infections, particularly acute rhinosinusitis (ARS), being a key contributor. This study explored the decision-making process regarding antibiotic use for ARS among general practitioners (GPs) and doctors in training working in general practice. Nine semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 doctors. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using systematic text condensation. Four key themes were developed: (1) 'It all starts before the consultation': staff-led triage shaping ARS care, (2) two diagnostic worlds: experienced intuition vs. rule-bound caution, (3) C-reactive protein (CRP) in the crossfire: guide, reassurance or irrelevant in antibiotic decision-making and (4) 'Sometimes it's a negotiation': managing patient expectations without losing stewardship. Although diagnosing ARS was often straightforward, distinguishing bacterial from viral infections proved difficult. C-reactive protein testing was common, but its reliability was questioned. Antibiotic prescribing decisions were influenced by patient history, comorbidities and risk factors. While antibiotics were rarely considered necessary initially, patient expectations and doctor-patient relationships sometimes influenced prescribing. This study illustrates the complexity of diagnosing and managing ARS, shaped by clinical uncertainty, competing priorities and non-clinical pressures. Variation in doctor involvement, diagnostic practices and CRP thresholds reveals the challenges of standardization. Training, guidelines and patient education are valued but may not ensure optimal antibiotic use. Diagnostic decisions are relational, negotiated and context-specific, influenced by public health concerns, patient needs and workflow demands. Without acknowledging this complexity, antibiotic stewardship efforts could potentially fall short.",

Antimicrobial resistance is a global public health concern, and few new agents are in the pipeline. Gonorrhea control programs rely on health education, access to diagnostic testing (where possible), effective therapy, and partner notification. Introducing inexpensive, sensitive, and specific point-of-care tests will aid antimicrobial stewardship efforts in countries utilizing the syndromic management approach. Targeted vaccination of higher-risk populations with cross-protective outer membrane vesicle-based meningococcal B-vaccines could reduce N. gonorrhoeae transmission in the future.

    "journal": "One health (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",
    "abstract": "The One Health framework articulates the interdependence of human, animal, and environmental health, gaining prominence amid rising zoonotic events, antimicrobial resistance, and biodiversity loss. While veterinary surgeons, physicians, and ecologists are typically emphasized in One Health discourse, the role of university-trained veterinary nurses-whose formal recognition remains nascent in parts of Europe-has received limited attention. Veterinary nurses occupy pivotal positions in clinical practice, implementing infection prevention protocols, conducting zoonotic disease surveillance, and maintaining hygiene standards among staff and clients. They support antimicrobial stewardship through responsible administration and client education, reducing the emergence of resistant pathogens. Additionally, veterinary nurses enhance animal welfare via behavioural assessments, safeguard food safety by supporting livestock health, and facilitate animal-assisted therapy through rigorous evaluation of therapy animals' health and behaviour. Their involvement in disaster response sustains animal health services, contributing to community resilience. As trusted professionals, veterinary nurses also serve as public health educators, leveraging their relationships with animal owners to promote evidence-based guidance on zoonoses prevention, biosecurity, and responsible antimicrobial use. Despite these multifaceted contributions, veterinary nursing practice in Europe is constrained by heterogeneous educational standards, inconsistent legal recognition, and limited participation in policy forums. Professional advocacy has driven incremental reforms; however, systematic harmonization of curricula, regulatory frameworks, and interdisciplinary collaboration remains essential. We argue that empowering veterinary nurses within One Health systems will optimize the early detection and control of shared health threats, strengthening One Health networks across Europe and similar contexts worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Penicillin allergy is a frequent challenge in perioperative antibiotic stewardship. Although 3%-10% of hospitalised patients declare a penicillin allergy, up to 95% of penicillin allergy labels are refuted through allergologic testing. Identifying incorrect penicillin allergy labels reduces the consumption of broad-spectrum second-line antibiotics, benefiting patients and society. Penicillin allergy evaluation is a recommended action for fighting antimicrobial resistance, and the procedure is under-facilitated perioperatively. Anaesthesiologists are important stakeholders in perioperative antibiotic stewardship, but knowledge about their attitudes and potential barriers to adopting penicillin allergy evaluation is scarce. We conducted a national, cross-sectional online survey among 1667 members of the Norwegian Anaesthesiology Association. The study was informed by the British Drug Allergy Labels in Elective Surgical Patients anaesthesiologist survey. The survey examined knowledge about perioperative allergies and penicillin allergy evaluations. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively, and qualitative data were analysed using systematic text condensation. We received 405 responses (24% response rate). Barriers to penicillin allergy evaluation included: (1) a perceived lack of knowledge, (2) time constraints and the absence of structured workflows, and (3) not feeling responsible for evaluating penicillin allergies. If respondents believed that the declared penicillin allergy was highly unlikely to represent a true allergy, 65% would administer penicillin. However, in patients de-labelled by oral provocation testing with penicillin, 34% of the respondents would still not re-expose the patient to penicillins. Senior clinicians expressed the lowest confidence in evaluating penicillin allergies, and respondents were mostly unaware of national penicillin allergy evaluation guidelines. Distrust in penicillin allergy evaluation procedures is prevalent among Norwegian anaesthesiologists. Key barriers to the implementation of perioperative penicillin allergy evaluation include time constraints, insufficient knowledge and unclear clinical responsibilities. To improve commitment, targeted education, specialty-specific guidelines, a simplified drug allergy warning system, and clearly defined roles are essential. We compared our results with results from the UK and found similar challenges. As our findings reflect challenges reported in other European countries, we call for a coordinated European initiative to enhance the implementation of perioperative penicillin allergy evaluations. Increasing anaesthesiologists' engagement in penicillin allergy evaluation can potentially improve perioperative outcomes and reduce antimicrobial resistance. This survey study assessed clinician opinions of penicillin allergy evaluation in one Scandinavian country. The authors present suggestions for improving the process for evaluation of suspected penicillin allergy as part of a general clinician responsibility for antibiotic treatment stewardship.",

This study aims to assess physicians' awareness and attitudes towards AMR and appropriate antimicrobial use across different medical specialties in Japan. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted from January 31 to February 5, 2024, among 280 physicians from three specialties (internal medicine, pediatrics, and otorhinolaryngology) who were working in outpatient clinics in Japan. Participants were asked about their familiarity with the National Action Plan (NAP) on AMR and the manuals of Ministry of Health and Labor Welfare (MHLW) on prudent antimicrobial use. Their opinions on AMR facts and antibiotic use were also surveyed using five-point Likert scales. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, multilevel mixed-effects ordered logistic regression and generalized linear models to examine factors influencing NAP/manuals adherence. Most respondents were male (85%) and predominantly aged 50 and above (73.9%), Familiarity with the AMR Action Plan varied, with 36.4% of respondents reported understanding its content, while 37.5% only knew its name. Similarly, 27.1% of respondents used the MHLW manuals, whereas 48.6% were aware of them but did not use them. Internal medicine physicians showed the highest adherence to antimicrobial stewardship and most concern about AMR facts, while pediatricians demonstrated the highest adherence to MHLW manuals (AOR\u2009=\u20092.4, p\u2009=\u20090.000 compared to internal medicine doctors). Otorhinolaryngologists reported higher awareness of NAP (AOR\u2009=\u20092.6, p\u2009=\u20090.006 compared to internal medicine doctors) but had the lowest adherence to NAP and MHLW manuals. Younger physicians (<\u200950 years) were more proactive in addressing AMR and adhering to antimicrobial stewardship than older physicians. Messages emphasizing the prevention of drug resistance and societal impacts of AMR were most associated with positive attitudes from physicians in outpatient clinics. This study highlights significant variability in AMR awareness and adherence across specialties and age groups. Internal medicine physicians showed the highest adherence, while pediatricians were the most familiar with AMR manuals. Otorhinolaryngologists demonstrated strong awareness but lower adherence. Targeted educational interventions, particularly focusing on older physicians and specific specialties, are needed to improve antimicrobial use and combat the growing threat of resistance.",

A qualitative methodology, focus groups (FGs), was conducted by videoconference, between July and December 2024. The FG guide was based on a comprehensive review of relevant literature. Sessions were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analysed using thematic analysis with webQDA software. Results: In total, 19 veterinarians participated in six FG. Three main themes were identified: (i) Antibiotic prescription, use, and management, (ii) Animal welfare management, and (iii) Fostering antibiotic stewardship. Veterinarians recognised the importance of prudent antibiotic use, but faced obstacles, such as farmer non-compliance, insufficient knowledge and/or economic constraints, and limited laboratory resources. National initiatives have increased awareness and surveillance efforts; however, implementation barriers remain, especially given regional farming differences. Findings suggest that addressing AMR requires medium- and long-term, tailored strategies involving policy reforms, enhanced veterinarian and farmer education, improved diagnostic capacity, and effective communication among stakeholders. Emphasising a One Health approach and considering regional contexts are vital to promoting responsible antibiotic use, advancing antibiotic stewardship, and reducing resistance.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global public health threat, which is primarily driven by the irrational use of antibiotics. Enhancing the pathogen submission rate before antimicrobial therapy is crucial for effective antimicrobial management in healthcare institutions. This study aimed to improve this rate using the FOCUS-PDCA (Find, Orgnize, Clarify, Understand, Select, Plan, Do, Check, Act) model in a tertiary hospital. The present study was conducted from 2021 to 2024, applying the FOCUS-PDCA model. Led by the Hospital Infection Management Department, a multi-disciplinary collaboration team was set up, with indicators and problems as the guide. The interventions included improving information monitoring technology, optimizing specimen collection and delivery processes, strengthening regulatory efforts, and establishing a diversified training system. Data were collected from 56 clinical departments and compared before and after intervention. The pathogen submission rate before antimicrobial therapy was notably increased from 64.99% in 2021 to 76.40% in 2024 ( The FOCUS-PDCA model effectively improved pathogen submission rates and specimen quality, reduced the detection rate of MDRO, and promoted rational antimicrobial use. This approach provides valuable experience for other clinical institutions aiming to enhance antimicrobial stewardship.",

    "abstract": "Private hospitals are critical to healthcare delivery in Kampala, Uganda, where antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes have been introduced as part of the Global Action Plan (GAP) to mitigate the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). However, there is limited empirical data on the extent of AMS implementation and the specific barriers these facilities face in adopting such programmes. We therefore evaluated the implementation status and identified key barriers to AMS uptake in private hospitals across Kampala, Uganda. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 9th January 2024-25th July 2024 in 17 private hospitals, using a mixed-methods approach. Quantitative data were collected using the Commonwealth Partnerships for Antimicrobial Stewardship (CwPAMS) Checklist and analysed descriptively. Qualitative data were gathered through key informant interviews and evaluated using content analysis. The findings revealed significant gaps in AMS implementation. Of the 17 hospitals surveyed, 70.6% (12/17) had not prioritised AMS initiatives in their operations. Besides, 88.2% (15/17) had no budget allocated for AMS activities and 82.4% (14/17) reported insufficient staffing. Additionally, 76.5% (13/17) had not provided AMS-specific training. Furthermore, 64.7% (11/17) lacked regular AMS reports, meeting minutes, or resources for antimicrobial prescribing optimisation, while 41.2% (7/17) had no designated AMS team lead. Besides, qualitative analysis showed structural and institutional challenges, including weak leadership commitment and a lack of sustainable financial planning for AMS programmes. The implementation of AMS programmes in selected private hospitals in Kampala was scanty and constrained by structural, financial, and institutional barriers, including inadequate budget allocation, insufficient staffing, limited training, and the lack of prioritisation of AMS activities. Strengthening institutional support through leadership engagement, funding, and embedding AMS as a core component of hospital policy is essential. Additionally, a multi-stakeholder approach is crucial to driving sustainable AMS adoption, aligning with global AMR mitigation efforts, and ensuring optimal patient outcomes.",

A search for online education resources was carried out to identify UG curricula or CFs for HCPs for AMS or antimicrobial resistance applicable to the UK. Seven curricula or CFs were identified and reviewed. One AMS CF for all UG health workers, three for pharmacy UG students, one nursing AMS CF, one medical AMS CF, and the pathology curriculum. Domains varied between them but significant overlap was identified, and the majority of knowledge objectives in the WHO modules were covered in all UG curricula/CFs (except those objectives listed under the role of laboratory staff, which were only in the pathology curriculum). Gaps were identified between the most recently published UG curricula for pharmacists and the UKHSA antimicrobial prescribing and stewardship CF. There is significant correlation between the UG curricula/CFs for HCPs in the UK, the WHO curricula guide, and UKHSA antimicrobial prescribing and stewardship CF; however, there are some identified gaps.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of this 2-year training programme, measuring knowledge, skills and tangible results. This observational cohort study included participants in the first AMS certificate programme, which started in June 2022. The programme included online and live courses covering relevant AMS learning goals. Participants also carried out a local AMS project using a determinant analysis with pre- and post-intervention measurements. Data were collected through surveys, exams, and an evaluation of mandatory reports to assess progress across Kirkpatrick's four levels of learning: reaction, learning, behaviour and results. Forty participants from 22 countries took part in the programme. Individual courses were positively evaluated (reaction, level 1). All participants passed the final exam (learning, level 2). After 2 years, 35/40 (88%) submitted their AMS project reports (behaviour, level 3). In 31/35 (89%) of projects a post-intervention measurement was performed, of which 26/31 (84%) showed a positive effect on either process outcomes (e.g. increase in guideline adherence), quantity outcomes (e.g. reduced broad-spectrum antibiotic use), or patient outcomes (e.g. length of stay) (results, level 4). The ESCMID AMS certificate programme effectively transfers knowledge and skills to participants who intend to develop ASPs in different clinical settings. Moreover, the course prompted the development and execution of local AMS projects with measurable impact on appropriate antibiotic use practices.",

    "abstract": "The misuse and/or overuse of antibiotics in animals has been a subject of concern due to the intensification of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Veterinarians are at the front line of antibiotic prescription and their decision-making process is impacted by several non-clinical factors. The aim of this systematic review was to identify and understand how veterinarians' attitudes, knowledge, perceptions, and experience influence antibiotic prescription practices. We systematically searched MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Knowledge, and CAB International databases. Quantitative and mixed methods studies with veterinary graduates were included, with no time restrictions. Articles written in English, Spanish, and Portuguese were considered. Quality assessment was performed with JBI's cross-sectional critical appraisal tool. Our search retrieved 4722 documents, with 59 being included. Articles' publication year ranged from 2004 to 2023, with most (n\u2009=\u200955) using a quantitative approach, and the remaining ones (n\u2009=\u20094) using mixed methods. Veterinary practices were categorized into four groups: livestock (n\u2009=\u200924), small animals (n\u2009=\u200914), equine (n\u2009=\u20095), and mixed practice (broader scope; n\u2009=\u200917). Intrinsic factors identified as potentially influencing veterinarians' antibiotic prescription included: socio-demographic factors (n\u2009=\u200939) and attitudes and concerns: self-confidence (n\u2009=\u200931); need to satisfy clients' expectations (n\u2009=\u200919); fear (n\u2009=\u200927); lack of knowledge (n\u2009=\u200921). Extrinsic factors were also identified in several studies: clients' lack of knowledge and/or training regarding AMR, appropriate antimicrobial use, and good production practices (n\u2009=\u200924); substandard hygiene conditions and biosecurity protocols (n\u2009=\u200914); time constraints (n\u2009=\u20094); cost of laboratory tests (n\u2009=\u200912); antibiotic policies and/or guidelines (n\u2009=\u200922); antibiotics cost (n\u2009=\u200920), and withdrawal period (n\u2009=\u200911); animal-related factors (n\u2009=\u200921), namely breeding and animals' behavior. This systematic review provides an updated and comprehensive understanding of non-clinical factors that can influence veterinarians' antibiotic prescription practices. High client demand, self-confidence, need to satisfy clients' expectations, deficient biosecurity, fear, lack of awareness from animal owners and farmers about AMR and appropriate antimicrobial use, and inadequate policies/guidelines were associated with higher antibiotic prescription among veterinarians. Many of the identified factors are potentially modifiable. Within the One Health approach, this can help in the design of interventions focusing on appropriate antibiotic use in animals to tackle AMR.",

    "abstract": "The indiscriminate use of antibiotics in food-producing animals contributes to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), posing a global threat. Understanding the factors associated with antibiotic use is critical to combat resistance while maintaining animal health. This study examined antibiotic use practices, mortality rates, biosecurity levels, as well as the associations between biosecurity and antibiotic use, and between biosecurity and mortality, in semi-intensive broiler farms in Kenya.The study was conducted in 129 semi-intensive farms with total flock sizes between 200 and 2000 birds across three peri-urban counties in Kenya. Data were collected prospectively over one production cycle, with farms visited biweekly using questionnaires and a drug bin approach. Biosecurity levels were assessed by a panel of experts who weighted scores for various external and internal biosecurity subcategories. Directed acyclic graphs (DAG) described potential relationships between explanatory variables, confounders and outcome. Logistic regression analysis was conducted with antibiotic use as the outcome variable. Explanatory variables with P\u2009<\u20090.25 in the univariable logistic regression were included in the multivariable regression. Similarly, linear regression was conducted using mortality as the outcome.Overall, 72% of farms used antibiotics, primarily for prophylaxis (66%), with erythromycin and oxytetracycline being the most commonly used antibiotics. The median mortality rate across the production cycle was 6%. There was no significant difference in mortality between farms using antibiotics and those not using antibiotics. Biosecurity practices were low, with a median biosecurity score of 14.3/67.9. Univariable screening suggested potential associations between antibiotic use and vaccination of day-old chicks, flock size, cleaning protocol for chicken drinkers, resting period between batches, feed store cleaning, water source, distance from neighbouring farms, and age. However, these were not significant in multivariable logistic regression. Linear regression showed an association between mortality and biosecurity measures, specifically disease management and visitor entry regulation.This study highlights widespread antibiotic use, low biosecurity implementation, and variability in mortality rates in the farms surveyed. There is a gap in farmers' implementation of effective biosecurity measures and understanding of prudent antibiotic use. An urgent need exists to develop comprehensive data collection methodologies, education, and interventions to promote responsible antibiotic stewardship and cost-effective biosecurity practices among poultry farmers in Kenya.",

A cross-sectional survey was carried out in November 2024 across four hospitals in the South West Region of Cameroon: Limbe Regional Hospital, Buea Regional Hospital Annex, Baptist Hospital Mutengene, and Kumba Baptist Health Center. For data collection, we used the standard WHO checklist to assess AMS activities at the healthcare facilities designed for low- and middle-income countries. Key informant interview involving the AMS focal persons of various hospitals enabled data collection. Limbe Regional Hospital has the highest full implementation rate of AMS activities (67%), while Buea regional hospital is the least of fully implemented activities (19%). An average of 49% of all AMS activities are fully implemented across the healthcare facilities, partially implemented activities made up 28%, only 3% of the activities are in the planning phase but not yet started. A 13% of the activities are not implemented across the studied facilities, while 7% of the activities are not implemented but identified as a priority. Although the rate is still low, there is good progress in implementation of AMS activities with most activities either fully or partially implemented; however, no health facility included AMS activities in their annual plans with key performance indicators, no management of any hospital allocated financial and human resources to initiate AMS activities. Strengthening institutional commitment and AMS training are recommended.",

We conducted a pre-post quasi-experimental study evaluating patients with severe pneumonia or sepsis before (October 2019-February 2020) and after (March 2022-March 2023) rDTSI implementation. The program integrated rapid molecular diagnostics, a 24/7 laboratory workflow, and multidisciplinary training. Primary outcomes included time from clinical diagnosis to pathogen-directed therapy and targeted therapy within 48\u2005h. Secondary outcomes assessed antimicrobial appropriateness (DOOR-MAT), length of stay, and mortality. The rDTSI program significantly reduced the median time to pathogen-directed therapy in pneumonia (48.8 vs 23.6\u2005h,  The rDTSI program accelerated microbiological diagnosis, optimized antimicrobial therapy, and improved hospital efficiency in severe infections. These findings support integrating rapid diagnostics into antimicrobial stewardship programs to enhance severe infection management.",

    "abstract": "Most antibiotics are prescribed, dispensed, and consumed in the community setting. Community pharmacists have a great potential to optimise antibiotic use and mitigate antibiotic resistance in this setting through antibiotic stewardship. This commentary aims to highlight critical areas where community pharmacists can contribute to optimising antibiotic use and to offer suggestions for how this can be implemented in practice. Currently, the role of the community pharmacist is mostly limited to dispensing of antibiotics and treatment of minor infectious ailments. This role needs to evolve to optimise antibiotic use and mitigate resistance development. Following the Social Care Framework for applying person-centred healthcare, there are five strategies through which the role of the community pharmacist can evolve: awareness, adjustment, assistance, alignment, and advocacy. Concretely, this could include many different activities such as better informing and counselling patients, optimising antibiotic treatment duration and choice, exact quantity dispensing, performing point-of-care tests, pharmacist prescribing of antibiotics, and joining academic detailing and public health campaigns. To achieve this, education, policy, and research need to be further aligned. In many countries, pharmacy education on antimicrobial stewardship needs a stronger basis in universities, followed by early career specialisation and continuous professional development. National and international policy changes are needed to recognise such specialisations and allow more advanced pharmacy services. Pharmacy research must be expanded and tailored to the community setting with innovative and practice-based designs. This will allow community pharmacists to fully embrace an enhanced position in antibiotic use and primary care.",

    "abstract": "Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are a growing public health threat in Nigeria, driven by inappropriate antibiotic use, limited surveillance, and weak healthcare infrastructure. Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are critical in addressing this challenge by promoting appropriate antibiotic use and reducing resistance. This scoping review synthesizes evidence published between 2018 and 2025, examining the challenges, opportunities, and strategies for implementing ASPs in Nigeria. Key challenges include inadequate diagnostic capacity, poor regulatory enforcement, and limited resources. Opportunities exist in leveraging technology, fostering international partnerships, and adopting the One Health approach. Proposed strategies include expanding diagnostic stewardship, increasing investment in laboratory infrastructure, enforcing antibiotic prescribing policies, integrating antimicrobial resistance (AMR) content into healthcare curricula, and launching targeted public awareness campaigns. Data visualization through figures and tables highlights resistance trends across common pathogens, conceptual ASP frameworks, implementation challenges, and the systematic review flowchart of study selection. The escalating burden of MDROs in Nigeria demands urgent and coordinated action. Strengthening antimicrobial stewardship through policy enforcement, infrastructure development, and education is essential to slow resistance and protect public health.",

    "abstract": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a major global health concern, traditionally diagnosed through chest X-ray (CXR). However, lung ultrasound (LUS) is increasingly emerging as a transformative tool in both diagnosis and management. Evidence from recent meta-analyses reveals that LUS outperforms CXR in sensitivity and rivals it in specificity, with pooled diagnostic accuracies exceeding 90\u202f%. Unlike CXR, LUS is radiation-free, cost-effective, and ideal for bedside use, making it particularly valuable in emergency departments, intensive care units, pediatric and geriatric populations, and resource-limited settings. In children, LUS spares radiation exposure, while in elderly patients, contrast-enhanced ultrasound improves diagnostic specificity. Beyond diagnosis, LUS enables dynamic monitoring, prognostic scoring (e.g., LUS score, CPIS-PLUS), and supports treatment decisions such as ventilator weaning and antibiotic stewardship. Recent applications during the COVID-19 pandemic have demonstrated its effectiveness in triage and outcome prediction. Despite challenges such as operator dependency and reduced penetration for deep lesions, technological advances-particularly artificial intelligence and handheld devices-are mitigating these limitations. Deep learning models now interpret LUS images with high accuracy, enhancing reproducibility and accessibility for general practitioners. In low- and middle-income countries, LUS serves as a crucial diagnostic bridge, improving access and reducing reliance on costly imaging modalities. As training programs and standardized scoring systems evolve, LUS is becoming a frontline tool rather than a supplementary option. Its integration into clinical practice promises to reshape pneumonia care through rapid, accurate, and scalable diagnostics. In light of these advancements, LUS is not just complementary to radiography-it is redefining the diagnostic landscape of pneumonia.",

Notably, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming MDR management through real-time diagnostics and resistance prediction, though ethical concerns and infrastructure deficits in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) remain barriers. Community-led initiatives, gender-sensitive education, and policy reforms are vital to curbing misuse and closing equity gaps. Despite successes, challenges such as fragmented governance, underfunded labs, and limited longitudinal research persist. A proactive, integrated One Health approach-linking clinical, environmental, and policy actions-is essential for reducing MDR burden.

    "abstract": "Coordinated practice supports a comprehensive approach combining infection prevention and the rational use of antibiotics (RUA), both essential to tackling antibiotic resistance effectively. Over 90% of prescriptions in France are issued in primary care, mainly by general practitioners. This study analyzes how RUA is integrated into the activities of Professional and Territorial Health Communities (CPTS; Communaut\u00e9s professionnelles territoriales de sant\u00e9) based on a survey of health care professionals in two CPTS from three French regions chosen for their engagement in national initiatives on antibiotic resistance. A total of 488 health care professionals were selected, with a participation rate of 32,4%. The results show uneven awareness of RUA and the \"One Health\" concept among professionals. While antibiotic resistance is perceived as a major issue, its integration into the CPTS's objectives remains limited. The study highlights the need to improve interprofessional coordination and ongoing training to optimize RUA, adapting strategies to each profession's specific needs and strengthening collaboration with regional centers for antibiotic stewardship (CRAtb). Integrating antibiotic resistance into CPTS missions appears to be a key strategy for effectively addressing this public health issue at the local level.

    "abstract": "During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, pediatric inpatients frequently received at least one antibiotic, and several antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) strategies were disrupted. In Mexico, no published data are available on antibacterial consumption in children. The aim of this study was to evaluate antibacterial consumption levels and trends before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic in a tertiary care pediatric hospital in Mexico, and to forecast future antibacterial consumption. This was a secondary analysis based on time series data of monthly antibacterial consumption from January 2016 to June 2024 in a tertiary care pediatric hospital. Antibacterial consumption was retrospectively measured for the pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic periods. Consumption was expressed as days of therapy (DOT) per 1000 patient-days (pd). The mean antibacterial consumption at the Hospital Infantil de M\u00e9xico Federico G\u00f3mez (HIMFG) from 2016 to 2024 was 789.3 (95% CI, 756.1-822.5) DOT/1000 pd. In the medical pediatric intensive care unit (M-PICU) and surgical pediatric intensive care unit (S-PICU), mean consumption was 1305.3 DOT/1000 pd (95% CI: 1119.1-1491.6) and 1634.5 DOT/1000 pd (95% CI: 1444.2-1824.9), respectively. Before the pandemic, the hospital-wide mean consumption was 848.8 DOT/1000 pd (95% CI: 811.3-886.2); during the pandemic, it was 709.6 DOT/1000 pd (95% CI: 650.3-769.0); and after the pandemic, 799.2 DOT/1000 pd (95% CI: 698.1-900.3). Overall, consumption rates oscillated around the mean, and no patterns were observed. The COVID-19 pandemic did not affect trends of antibacterial consumption across the hospital or in the pediatric intensive care unit.

    "abstract": "Adopting international guidelines on the prudent use of antimicrobials in companion animal practices has been debated in Hong Kong. This study was conducted to assess antimicrobial use (AMU) practices among companion animal veterinarians in Hong Kong and highlight the areas for targeted interventions. Data on demographics, antimicrobial prescribing behaviors, and administered antibiotic classes were collected using an online questionnaire targeting all registered companion animal veterinarians in Hong Kong (estimated at 800-900). Of all invited veterinarians, 112 submitted the survey and 74 finished the questionnaire. Most respondents worked in primary care practices (76.4\u202f%) and were women (67.4\u202f%); 85\u202f% reported the absence of a formal, written AMU policy in their clinics. Veterinary drug handbooks were the main source of information used for AMU (76\u202f%), followed by courses or workshops (64.6\u202f%) and clinicians' professional experience and judgment (59.5\u202f%). Owner compliance issues regarding the dosage and duration of AMU were never-rarely observed by 63\u202f%, and 21.5\u202f% reported they never-rarely requested culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing to guide their AMU. The majority (71\u202f%) prescribed antimicrobials empirically in >\u202f30\u202f% of cases. Most frequent barriers to ordering and conducting the susceptibility test were the financial burden on animal owners (82\u202f%), delay in starting treatments (56\u202f%), and time constraints (24\u202f%). Most respondents never or rarely used preoperative (81\u202f%) or postoperative (86\u202f%) antimicrobials in clean surgical procedures. We highlighted key gaps in antimicrobial stewardship which can be addressed through locally tailored guidelines informed by our findings, education for veterinarians and pet owners, and improved enforcement of antimicrobial regulations.",

    "journal": "Folia microbiologica",
    "abstract": "Microbiological diagnostics have become a foundational element in hematology nursing, where early and accurate infection detection is vital for immunocompromised patients. This review explores how both traditional techniques, such as microscopy, culture, and antigen detection, and emerging technologies, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, contribute to clinical decision-making and infection control. These tools not only accelerate pathogen identification and resistance profiling but also support precision medicine approaches tailored to hematologic patient needs. The expanding role of hematology nurses is emphasized, particularly in diagnostic stewardship, specimen collection, result interpretation, and coordination of infection management strategies. Educational interventions have proven effective in reducing contamination rates and improving antimicrobial targeting. Furthermore, novel point-of-care platforms, such as CRISPR-based diagnostics and AI-enhanced digital PCR, are shifting diagnostic capabilities closer to the bedside, redefining nursing workflows and responsibilities. These innovations empower nurses to engage in real-time clinical decisions, monitor therapy responses, and enhance patient education regarding diagnostic procedures and infection risks. However, gaps remain in microbiology-related training and confidence among nurses, highlighting the need for integrated educational curricula and interdisciplinary collaboration. By aligning technological advancements with frontline nursing practice, microbiological diagnostics not only optimize patient outcomes but also elevate the role of nurses as key stakeholders in infection prevention, antimicrobial stewardship, and evidence-based care. This review underscores the urgent need to equip hematology nurses with the skills and tools necessary to adapt to the rapidly evolving diagnostic landscape in order to support safe, timely, and personalized healthcare delivery.",

    "abstract": "Effective antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programs must address the needs of culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) patients who often experience language barriers and varying cultural beliefs regarding antibiotics. They are at greater risk of receiving suboptimal or inappropriate care, yet guidance to support AMS practices for this population remains limited. To investigate antibiotic knowledge, perspectives, and experiences of CALD patients. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May to November 2023 at a Western Sydney tertiary hospital. Adult patients of CALD background on systemic antibiotics for more than 72 hours under surgical, respiratory, and geriatric specialties were surveyed on their understanding of their antibiotic treatment. Of the 177 patients, median age was 70 years old (21-99 years), and 95/177 (53.7%) were males. Of the 177 patients, 171/177 (96.6%) reported speaking a language other than English at home. While 160/177 (90.4%) patients were told that they were treated with antibiotics, only 67/177 (37.9%) were told about duration, 35/177 (19.8%) were told about the side effects, and 27/177 (15.3%) were given written information. Information was provided by doctors to 125/177 (70.6%) patients, 72/177 (40.7%) by nurses, and 3/177 (1.7%) by pharmacists. Patients preferred to have received information from their doctor 79/177 (44.6%) or any healthcare professional 91/177 (51.4%). Improving antibiotic education for CALD patients is essential to address communication gaps. Enhancing knowledge will support appropriate use, improved adherence and outcomes, and promote shared decision-making. Strengthening health literacy in CALD populations should be a priority for AMS programs.",

The American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Urgent Care Medicine and Pediatric Acute and Critical Care Quality Network developed a multicenter quality improvement collaborative. We used national guidelines to determine criteria for nonsevere AOM and first-line antibiotics for AOM and pharyngitis. Participating UCCs committed at least 3 clinicians to submit 10 encounters for each diagnosis per month during the intervention period (October 2022 to June 2023). Clinicians signed commitment letters, participated in monthly learning sessions, and tested UCC-selected interventions. We recruited 84 participants from 13 UCCs. Participants submitted 5017 AOM encounters and 3762 pharyngitis encounters. The use of first-line antibiotics for AOM and GAS pharyngitis remained stable at 75.7% and 79.9%, respectively, throughout the project. The documentation of delayed antibiotic criteria increased from a range of 26%-27% at baseline to 83% [5.42% per month (95% CI: 4.03-6.81)]. This corresponded to an increase in use of delayed antibiotics for AOM from a range of 32%-42% at baseline to 70% by the end of the intervention period [2.53% per month (95% CI: 0.57-4.48)]. Rates of GAS testing before treating pharyngitis increased during baseline and remained high (>96%) throughout the intervention period. This multicenter collaborative provided education and networking to increase the use of delayed antibiotics for AOM in pediatric UCCs.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) pose a serious threat to healthcare systems. Accurately determining the incidence of HCAIs is crucial for planning and implementing efficient interventions, as they are associated with a wide range of challenges. The objective of this study was to assess and update the incidence rates of HCAIs in Iran in 2023, using data from the Iranian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance (INIS) system, a nationwide hospital-based surveillance program. The Iranian Center for Communicable Diseases Control (ICDC) evaluated data from 1,066 hospitals using the INIS software. Hospitals' trained infection control staff collected all information and entered it into the INIS. HCAIs were diagnosed based on the CDC/NHSN case definition criteria. We calculated incidence rate (per 100 admissions and per 1,000 patient-days). We reported 170,948 HCAIs among 11,043,373 hospitalized patients, with an incidence rate of 4.95 per 1,000 patient-days, and the crude mortality rate of 19.85%. Looking at the relative frequencies, Pneumonia was the most frequent infection (28.32%), followed by urinary tract infections (UTIs) (26.6%), and surgical site infections (SSIs) (21.85%). HCAI rates were highest in intensive care units (ICUs), transplant wards, and burn units, with major surgeries like cardiovascular, neurosurgeries, and orthopedics having the highest SSI rates. The most common microorganisms were Klebsiella spp. (16.56%) and E. coli (14.6%), with high proportions of multidrug-resistance (MDR) including MRSA (43.2%), VRE (65.24%), and KPC (74.21%). This study reveals a high incidence of HCAIs in Iranian hospitals in 2023, with pneumonia, UTIs, and SSIs being most common. The high proportion of MDR pathogens underscores the need for enhanced infection control, antibiotic stewardship program, and continuous staff education to reduce HCAIs and improve patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains a critical global health challenge, and is mainly due to inappropriate antimicrobial use in human and animal health sectors. This systematic review examines the roles of Community Animal Health Workers (CAHWs) and Community Health Workers (CHWs) in antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) across Africa where AMR burden is highest and AMS programs are limited. Following PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review analyzed 16 studies (2017-2024) from nine African nations. We identified seven key roles of CAHWs and CHWs in AMS: 1) provision of clinical services (13 studies); 2) community mobilization (8 studies); 3) health promotion (7 studies); 4) provision of preventive services (5 studies); 5) epidemiological surveillance (4 studies); 6) advocacy (2 studies), and 7) medical waste management (2 studies). Despite their roles, challenges such as lack of supportive legislation (3 studies), inadequate remuneration (2 studies), and total reliance on foreign funding hinder AMS program sustainability. While most studies (14 studies) indicated that CAHWs and CHWs had received AMS training, their roles in the national AMR strategies remain unclear. CAHW and CHWs could be leveraged in advancing health promotion, raising AMR awareness, supporting AMR surveillance, enhancing integrated management of diseases, and improving waste management within One Health frameworks. To realize this potential, there is a need to formalize CAHW/CHW roles through targeted legislation, specialized training and sustainable funding. This evidence highlights the critical need for policy reforms to harness their potential in strengthening health systems and curbing AMR across Africa. PROSPERO registration number: CRD420251027215. Antimicrobial resistance is a global health that is most pronounced in Africa, where the overuse and misuse of antibiotics among humans and animals is very common. This review set out to identify the roles of Community Health and Animal Health Workers in promoting responsible use of antibiotics (antimicrobial stewardship) across Africa. In this review that included 16 studies from nine African countries, published between 2017 and 2024, we noted that community health and animal health workers provided the following antimicrobial stewardship related services; clinical treatment, community mobilization, health promotion, preventative services, diseases surveillance, advocacy and medical waste management in the communities they served. Despite the roles performed by community health and animal health workers, such programs face challenges such as poor funding frameworks, lack of enabling government policy nor legislation and poor provision of renumeration. Even though most articles reported training, their roles in antimicrobial resistance national action plans remain unclear. These workers could play a bigger role in stopping the spread of AMR by educating people, helping track drug resistance, and supporting public health efforts. To do this, governments need to create clear laws, provide proper training, and secure local sustainable funding.

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) poses a significant global health threat, leading to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Intensive Care Units (ICUs) are particularly susceptible to AMR due to frequent invasive procedures, extended hospital stays, and the selective pressure exerted by broad-spectrum antibiotics. This review aims to shed light on the current landscape of antibiotic resistance within ICUs of Saudi hospitals. It also explores molecular patterns of bacterial resistance and identifies potential strategies to address this issue. Additionally, it discusses the challenges in implementing these strategies within the Saudi healthcare system. We conducted a literature search across electronic databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Google Scholar, until September 30th, 2024, to identify relevant studies. Selected studies were analyzed to extract insights into prevailing bacterial resistance trends in Saudi ICUs and the molecular mechanisms responsible. Our findings provide an overview of the current state of AMR in Saudi ICUs, including the emergence and prevalence of specific molecular patterns of bacterial resistance. Moreover, it presents potential strategies to combat antibiotic resistance, including antimicrobial stewardship programs, infection control measures, and the development of new antibiotics. It also highlights the inherent challenges in implementing these strategies within the unique healthcare landscape of Saudi Arabia. The increasing emergence and spread of MDR bacteria in Saudi Arabia are attributed to the unoptimized antibiotic use, over-the-counter antibiotics without prescription, a high volume of international travellers, and challenges in adherence to infection control practices. Addressing the challenges and implementing effective prevention strategies are critical to maintaining antibiotic efficacy and combating AMR. Several strategies have been employed by the National AMR Committee, in partnership with WHO, to address antibiotic resistance in intensive care units. AMR in Saudi ICUs is a pressing concern requiring immediate attention. A multifaceted approach combining surveillance, education, and policy interventions is essential to overcome this issue. Addressing AMR is crucial for global efforts to preserve the efficacy of antibiotics and maintain the effectiveness of critical healthcare interventions.",

    "abstract": "Excessive and improper use of antimicrobials is a major driver of antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) addresses this by promoting judicious use of antimicrobials. This study evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of an AMS program in district hospitals in Vietnam. A before-and-after study was undertaken in four district hospitals in Vietnam over 6 months. Interventions included (i) establishing AMS committees and teams, (ii) distribution of antimicrobial guidelines, (iii) healthcare worker training, and (iv) conducting periodic standardised audits of appropriateness of antimicrobial prescriptions, followed by tailored feedback. The co-primary outcomes were (i) monthly antimicrobial consumption in the hospital and (ii) appropriateness of antimicrobial prescribing according to guidelines, before and after the AMS program. Secondary outcomes included changes in antimicrobial costs and all-cause mortality. The AMS program was successfully implemented with strong stakeholder engagement and high staff participation across all four hospitals. At baseline, 79.0\u202f% (95\u202f% CI: 74.9\u202f%, 83.7\u202f%) of 454 antimicrobial prescriptions were inappropriate, primarily due to prolonged duration, overly broad-spectrum agents, or incorrect dosing. No improvement was observed post-intervention, with 80.3\u202f% (95\u202f% CI: 77.4\u202f%, 83.1\u202f%) of 992 prescriptions deemed inappropriate. A modest reduction in antimicrobial consumption was seen post-intervention, with a decrease of 4.2 DDD/100 bed-days per month (95\u202f% CI: - 6.2, - 2.3). Antimicrobial costs were unchanged. All-cause mortality reduced post-intervention [RR =\u202f0.32 (95\u202f% CI: 0.09, 0.92)]. AMS interventions were feasible to implement in district hospitals in Vietnam and resulted in modest reductions in antimicrobial consumption and all-cause mortality. However, the persistently high rates of inappropriate prescribing highlight the need for broader implementation and strengthening of stewardship efforts to more effectively address key drivers of antimicrobial resistance at the district level.",

Recent studies demonstrate the safety of PA delabeling in pediatric primary care. We aimed to identify primary care practitioners' attitudes towards PA delabeling, and perceived barriers and enablers to PA delabeling. We conducted semi structured interviews (n=11) and focus groups (n=3) with 29 primary care practitioners of two health systems in the northeast United States. We coded transcripts using content analysis and mapped barriers and enablers to the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation COM-B model of behavior. Participants perceived PA delabeling to benefit children and shared prior attempts to delabel PAs in primary care. Barriers to PA delabeling included a lack of skills and training to delabel (capability), perceived caregiver resistance to delabel, inadequate time, staff, and space to delabel (opportunity), which led to mixed desires among practitioners to delabel (motivation). To enable PA delabeling in primary care, participants recommended partnership with allergists to implement a delabeling protocol, tools to engage caregivers in delabeling, innovative workflows and infrastructures to facilitate delabeling, and an amplification of reasons for delabeling to occur in pediatric primary care. Primary care practitioners perceived PA delabeling as beneficial to children's health, and specified intervention targets (enablers) to facilitate delabeling. To propel PA delabeling in pediatric primary care, interventions are needed to optimize practitioner skills, secure caregiver interest, and ensure the necessary resources, time, and space for practitioners to delabel.",

    "abstract": "To improve antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) and reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions in young children in a British primary care setting. Forty-nine general practices in the South of England each hosted a 1\u2005h in-house workshop, facilitated by trained local pharmacy professionals. This type of educational outreach approach using TARGET (Target Antibiotics Responsibly, Guidance, Education and Tools) antibiotic materials has previously been shown to reduce antibiotic dispensing in a UK primary care setting. The workshop included a review of antibiotic prescribing data, a presentation on paediatric AMS showcasing locally agreed paediatric prescribing guidelines and safety-netting resources from the Healthier Together website, and formulation of a local action plan. The primary outcome measure was total oral antibiotic prescriptions ('items') dispensed per 1000 patients aged under 5\u2005years for the year after the workshop, compared with the previous year's dispensing. The median prescribing rate for children under 5\u2005years of age changed from a baseline of 48.9 per 1000 patients prior to the intervention to a new median monthly prescribing rate of 39.0 per 1000 patients following the intervention. There was no increase in paediatric presentations to primary care following the intervention. This low-cost intervention has the potential to reduce primary care antibiotic prescribing in children and we did not detect an increase in GP attendance rates after this intervention in our study. It could easily be rolled out nationwide.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in microbiome research have highlighted the oral cavity as a complex and dynamic ecosystem, home to over 700 microbial species that play critical roles in both oral and systemic health. The oral microbiota not only maintains local tissue homeostasis but also serves as a reservoir for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, contributing to the global spread of resistance. Frequent and sometimes inappropriate antibiotic use in dental practice, along with exposure to antiseptics and biocides, drives the emergence and horizontal transfer of resistance determinants within oral biofilms. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms and ecological drivers of AMR in the oral microbiome, emphasizing the clinical implications of dysbiosis and drug-resistant infections. The authors advocate for the development of dental clinical guidelines tailored to the unique characteristics of the oral microbiota, focusing on personalized therapy through molecular diagnostics, standardized AMR risk assessment, and the integration of non-antibiotic strategies such as probiotics and photodynamic therapy. Continuous education in antimicrobial stewardship and the implementation of oral-specific AMR surveillance is also highlighted as an essential component of effective resistance management. To support rational prescribing, a dedicated mobile application has been developed, leveraging microbiota data and resistance profiles to guide evidence-based, targeted therapy and reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. Collectively, these strategies aim to preserve antibiotic efficacy, ensure patient safety, and promote sustainable infection management in the dental field.",

    "abstract": "Strengthening antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programs is an invaluable intervention in the ongoing efforts to contain the threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), particularly in low-resource settings. This study evaluates the impact of the Telementoring, Education, and Advocacy Collaboration initiative for Health through Antimicrobial Stewardship (TEACH AMS), which uses the virtual Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) learning model to enhance AMS capacity in Kenya, Ghana, and Malawi. A mixed-methods approach was used, which included attendance data collection, facility-level assessments, post-session and follow-up surveys, as well as focus group discussions. Between September 2023 and February 2025, 77 virtual learning sessions were conducted, engaging 2445 unique participants from hospital-based AMS committees and health professionals across the three countries. Participants reported significant knowledge gain, and data showed facility improvements in two core AMS areas, including the implementation of multidisciplinary ward-based interventions/communications and enhanced monitoring of antibiotic resistance patterns. Along those lines, participants reported that the program assisted them in improving prescribing and culture-based treatments, and also evidence-informed antibiotic selection. The evidence of implementing ward-based interventions was further stressed in focus group discussions, as well as other strengthened practices like point-prevalence surveys, and development or revision of stewardship policies. Substantial improvements in microbiology services were also shared by participants, particularly in Malawi. Other practices mentioned were strengthened multidisciplinary communication, infection prevention efforts, and education of patients and the community. Our findings suggest that a virtual case-based learning educational intervention, providing structured and tailored AMS capacity building, can drive behavior change and strengthen healthcare systems in low resource settings. Future efforts should aim to scale up the engagements and sustain improvements to further strengthen AMS capacity.",

Locally, 50-60% of patients had extended prophylaxis after pacemaker insertion or generator change. Our antimicrobial stewardship programme (ASP) incorporated behavioural change strategies in implementing a multi-pronged intervention bundle to address this and evaluated its effectiveness and safety. This single-centre, retrospective cohort study included patients aged 21 years old or older, undergoing uncomplicated pacemaker insertion or generator change at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) from October 2022 to March 2025. To improve antibiotic use, ASP interventions incorporating behaviour change strategies were implemented, namely (1) data-driven feedback, (2) targeted education, (3) identification and engagement of ASP champion, and (4) clinical pathway revision. There were 779 patients evaluated; 380 (48.8%) received standard prophylaxis while 399 (51.2%) received extended prophylaxis with oral antibiotics (mean duration, 3.3 \u00b1 0.8 days). Following ASP interventions, the practice of extended prophylaxis declined significantly from 43.8% to 24.0% ( The bundled ASP interventions, incorporating behavioural change strategies, have effectively and safely reduced the use of extended prophylaxis post-cardiac device implantation.

    "abstract": "Maternal sepsis is the third leading cause of maternal mortality globally. However, the risk of maternal sepsis can be reduced by administering antibiotics prophylactically before infection occurs. Previous research has assessed the effects of azithromycin prophylaxis during pregnancy, but evidence is lacking on the effects of other types of antibiotics, and the potential for antimicrobial resistance. To assess the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis in women in labour after 28\u202fweeks' gestation on the prevention of maternal and neonatal infections and mortality. We used CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, one other database, and two trial registries, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify eligible studies. We did not restrict the search by publication type or language. The latest search date was 30 July 2024. We included randomised controlled trials involving pregnant women in labour after 28 gestational weeks, comparing any antibiotic prophylaxis with placebo or no treatment. We included trials of women anticipating a vaginal delivery, irrespective of baseline risk factors (unselected, lower-risk, or higher-risk), and without an indication for antibiotic prophylaxis in any care setting. We excluded trials that enroled only women with a planned caesarean section or a known bacterial infection (such as group B Streptococcus), and trials evaluating antibiotics for treatment rather than prevention. Our key outcomes of interest, as presented in the summary of findings table, were: incidence of maternal sepsis, maternal mortality, neonatal sepsis, neonatal mortality, wound infection (perineal), adverse effects of antibiotics, and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission. We used the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2) to assess the risk of bias. We synthesised results for each outcome using random-effects meta-analysis in Review Manager. Meta-analyses were conducted using the inverse-variance method for dichotomous and continuous outcomes. We used a narrative synthesis following the SWiM (Synthesis Without Meta-analysis) reporting guideline for outcomes that could not be pooled statistically due to heterogeneity or limited data. We summarised key findings from individual studies descriptively and structured by outcome domain. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. We included four trials with 42,846 participants (21,501 in the intervention groups versus 21,345 in the control groups). All were individually randomised trials conducted in low- and middle-income countries. Three trials used a single oral dose of azithromycin in the intervention group, while the fourth used a combination of azithromycin and amoxicillin. All four trials used a placebo control. We judged three trials to have an overall low risk of bias, and the remaining trial to be at 'some concerns', due to reporting bias. Below, we report on the key outcomes of interest, as presented in the summary of findings table. Compared to placebo, any antibiotic use: \u2022 probably reduces maternal sepsis (1.8% in the placebo group versus 1.2% in the antibiotic group; risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 0.77; I Offering a single oral dose of prophylactic antibiotics to pregnant women in labour after 28 gestational weeks or more probably reduces maternal sepsis. It likely results in little to no difference in maternal mortality, and results in little to no difference in neonatal sepsis, neonatal mortality, perineal wound infection, and NICU admission. Evidence on antimicrobial resistance is very uncertain: short-term increases in resistant organisms were observed in some maternal samples, but no persisting between-group differences were found at 11 to 13 months' follow-up. Implementation should be cautious and accompanied by antimicrobial stewardship and AMR surveillance, and future research should better quantify AMR effects and identify optimal antibiotic strategies.

    "abstract": "Introduction Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a pressing global health issue, exacerbated by inappropriate antibiotic use. In Iran, the 2016 National Action Plan on AMR established hospital-based antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs), including audit-feedback, prescription restrictions, and guideline-based prescribing to promote rational prescribing. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted these efforts, resulting in increased empirical antibiotic use. This qualitative study, using a descriptive phenomenological approach, explores healthcare providers' perceptions of antibiotic prescribing and ASP implementation in two Iranian teaching hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on context-specific barriers and adaptations. Methods Conducted from May 20, 2022, to January 20, 2023, at two 500-bed teaching hospitals in Qazvin, Iran, this descriptive phenomenological study involved 12 purposively sampled healthcare providers (10 physicians, one clinical pharmacist, one microbiology lab supervisor) until thematic saturation, achieved when no new themes emerged after the 10th interview, as confirmed by codebook review. Semi-structured interviews (45-60 minutes), conducted in Persian in private settings, explored prescribing changes, ASP disruptions, and adaptations. Transcripts were translated into English, anonymized, and analyzed thematically, generating ~150 codes clustered into four themes. Trustworthiness was ensured via triangulation, audit trails, and member checking, with translation accuracy verified by a second bilingual researcher. Ethical approval was granted by the Qazvin University of Medical Sciences Ethics Committee (IR.QUMS.REC.1403.091). Results Four themes emerged from the qualitative analysis, reflecting participant-reported experiences: (1) Increased empirical prescribing - all participants reported diagnostic uncertainty and public pressure driving preemptive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., ceftriaxone, meropenem). (2) Disruption of stewardship programs - most participants (10/12) noted suspended ASP activities (e.g., audits) due to staff redeployment. (3) Systemic and laboratory constraints - all participants highlighted delayed cultures and antibiotic shortages as barriers. (4) Adaptations and lessons learned - most participants (10/12) described late-2021 adaptations like virtual consultations. All findings reflect participant-reported experiences and perceptions, not objectively verified outcomes. Conclusion This qualitative study provides exploratory insights into healthcare providers' perceptions of AMS disruptions in two Qazvin hospitals, with reported increases in empirical prescribing due to uncertainty and resource constraints. Participant-reported adaptations, such as virtual reviews, were noted, though their sustainability remains unevaluated. International comparisons with the UAE, UK, and India highlight shared challenges and the need for context-specific protocols and diagnostics. Findings are limited to participant perceptions and require further validation through mixed-methods research. Policymakers may consider exploratory strategies like virtual tools and public education, pending feasibility studies.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global concern, the drivers and consequences of which are exacerbated by poverty and inequality, with Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) bearing the highest rates, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa. Armed conflict further exasperates problem, by damaging healthcare systems, limiting access to essential medicines, and increasing the use of antibiotics in uncertain environments. This study sought to explore healthcare professionals' views on AMR and antimicrobial stewardship challenges before and during the conflict to investigate the impact of armed conflict on antimicrobial stewardship (ASP) in Sudan, a low-income country facing a humanitarian crisis exacerbated by ongoing violence. Data was collected via an anonymous qualitative online survey completed by healthcare workers with experience before and during the conflict and was analysed via thematic analysis. Sudan is experiencing significant challenges due to its fragile healthcare system, poverty, and inequality. The results identify barriers to ASPs before and during the conflict, including lack of laboratory facilities, inadequate training, and the indiscriminate use of antibiotics. The findings reveal that the conflict has intensified the risk of AMR, with disrupted healthcare services leading to increased self-medication and reliance on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The study underscores the urgent need for multi-faceted interventions that address immediate healthcare needs while implementing long-term strategies to control AMR in conflict-affected regions. Recommendations include enhancing healthcare infrastructure, improving diagnostic capabilities, and fostering collaborations among various stakeholders to ensure sustainable AMR prevention strategies.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a global burden, with inappropriate antibiotic prescribing being an important contributing factor. Antibiotic prescribing guidelines play an important role in improving the quality of antibiotic use, provided they are evidence-based and regularly updated. As a result, they help reduce AMR, which is a critical challenge in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Consequently, the objective of this study was to evaluate local, national, and international antibiotic prescribing guidelines currently available-especially among LMICs-and previous challenges, in light of the recent publication of the WHO AWaRe book, which provides future direction. Google Scholar and PubMed searches were complemented by searching official country websites to identify antibiotic prescribing guidelines, especially those concerning empiric treatment of bacterial infections, for this narrative review. Data were collected on the country of origin, income level, guideline title, year of publication, development methodology, issuing organization, target population, scope, and coverage. In addition, documentation on implementation strategies, compliance, monitoring of outcome measures, and any associated patient education or counseling efforts were reviewed to assess guideline utilization. A total of 181 guidelines were included, with the majority originating from high-income countries (109, 60.2%), followed by lower-middle-income (40, 22.1%), low-income (18, 9.9%), and upper-middle-income (14, 7.7%) countries. The GRADE methodology was used in only 20.4% of the sourced guidelines, predominantly in high-income countries. Patient education was often underemphasized, particularly in LMICs. The findings highlighted significant disparities in the development, adaptation, and implementation of guidelines across different WHO regions, confirming the previously noted lack of standardization and comprehensiveness in LMICs. Significant disparities exist in the availability, structure, and methodological rigor of antibiotic prescribing guidelines across countries with different income levels.

    "abstract": "Non-prescription antibiotic use is common in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in community-settings, yet research often overlooks social and commercial drivers beyond formal-healthcare. This qualitative study conducted 64 in-depth interviews-16 each with pharmacy drug-sellers, pharmaceutical sales-representatives, registered-physicians, and antibiotic-users-across two urban and two rural areas in Bangladesh. Using a social-ecological systems framework, it examined how social-and-commercial determinants influence perceptions and practices in antibiotic marketing, prescription, dispensing, and use. Public-healthcare deficiencies-long waits, medication and staff shortages, limited diagnostics, and referrals to private facilities-render services inadequate and inequitable, pushing patients toward private and informal providers. High consultation fees in private facilities and out-of-pocket costs deter low-income-groups from consulting registered-physicians for 'non-severe illnesses', driving them to seek quick recovery directly from drug-sellers and unqualified-providers. These drug-sellers and informal-providers, known as doctors for their symptomatic-treatment practices, often lead to unnecessary antibiotic use without proper assessment. Weak accountability, poor enforcement, and unregistered pharmacies staffed by untrained personnel allow unregulated sales to persist. Pharmaceutical companies heavily influence prescribing and dispensing through sales representatives, who routinely engage formal and informal providers-advising on dosages and offering financial incentives, commissions, and gifts. Companies strategically target informal-providers and drug-sellers, capitalizing on their symptomatic treatment practices to boost sales, while drug-sellers rely on physician-prescriptions and sales-representatives' guidance. To sustain business, drug-sellers often sell over-the-counter antibiotics and offer symptomatic treatments despite regulations. Patients expect fast recovery, viewing \"good-doctors\" as those who prescribe immediate medications empirically. Patients' prior exposure to antibiotics from informal sources influences formal providers' decisions, leading them to prescribe stronger antibiotics when first-line antibiotics or non-antibiotics would suffice. Cost barriers lead many patients to buy partial courses and stop treatment once symptoms subsite, ignoring advice to complete the regimen-further exacerbating misuse. Effective antimicrobial stewardship requires health-system strengthening, context-specific policies, and behavior-change interventions targeting supply and demand, raising awareness, enforcing regulations, and aligning with stakeholders' economic realities.",

    "abstract": "to evaluate the educational elements and actions of the Antimicrobial Stewardship Program (ASP) in Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PED-ICU) in Brazil. this was a multicenter, prospective study carried out between October 2022 and January 2023, using an electronic form. Educational actions for professionals and patients on microbial resistance were analyzed, as well as interventions to improve prescribing, such as prospective audits, feedback and pre-authorization. The data was grouped by location, care profile and number of beds and analyzed using parametric and non-parametric statistical methods. of the 219 PED-ICUs with ASP in place, 44.7% were in the Southeast and 58.9% carried out continuing education for professionals. Only 6.8% promoted educational activities for patients and companions, concentrated in public hospitals with more than 200 beds. The education component showed weaknesses, especially in smaller hospitals, while actions to improve prescribing were more consolidated, with 70.8% implemented. Private hospitals and those in the Southeast and South stood out in terms of adherence to management practices. the study revealed significant disparities in the implementation of ASPs in Brazilian PED-ICUs, highlighting the need to strengthen continuing education and engage all those involved in order to increase adherence, reduce antimicrobial resistance and improve pediatric care. (1) ASP in Brazilian PED-ICU shows gaps in antimicrobial education and prescription. (2) Insufficient education compromises the rational use of antimicrobials in Brazil. (3) Regional inequality challenges ASP in public and private hospitals. (4) Larger, private hospitals lead the way in adherence to ASP in PED-ICU in Brazil. (5) Educational strategies and audits strengthen antimicrobial control in ASP.

    "abstract": "The global rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a significant health concern. Nitrofurantoin is used as a first-line antibiotic against many uropathogenic bacterial pathogens, including uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), and an analysis is required to assess the current global prevalence of nitrofurantoin-resistant UPEC. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar was performed to find studies reporting nitrofurantoin-resistant UPEC in humans. Studies were included/excluded based on predefined criteria and focused only on isolates collected from the urinary tract. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI's) Checklist for Prevalence Studies. Statistical analysis was performed using Metafor and Meta (R packages) to estimate the pooled prevalence, assess publication bias and perform heterogeneity analysis. Sixty-three studies comprising 774\u200a499 UPEC isolates collected between 1996 and 2024 were analysed and demonstrated a global pooled prevalence of nitrofurantoin-resistant UPEC isolates to be 6.9% (95% CI: 4.8%-9.7%). Continent-wise subgroup analysis showed Europe to have the lowest prevalence, while Asia has the highest prevalence. Decade-wise subgroup analysis showed the global prevalence increased from 2.8% (1996-04) to 8.2% (2005-14) and then decreased to 7.6% in the last decade (2015-24). Substantial heterogeneity was seen among the studies examined, as well as statistically significant publication bias. The findings show considerable global prevalence of nitrofurantoin-resistant UPEC isolates, with the prevalence being higher in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

Since the main cause of AMR is the inappropriate use of antibiotics for prophylactic or empirical treatment, antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASPs) have been developed. Few papers on ASPs describe prospective audits in oncology settings. In light of this, the Italian Association of Medical Oncology (AIOM) has decided to evaluate the oncologists' perceptions of this issue with a brief survey. An anonymous 14-item questionnaire was shared online during the XXVI National Congress on the AIOM website. The survey was divided into two sections. The first set of questions collected the hospital organization and practices (Q1-Q6), while the second one was about the clinical practices and antibiotic therapy (Q7-Q14). Sixty-four medical oncologists completed the anonymous questionnaire. Seventy-two percent of respondents believe that AMR is a significant issue in cancer patients, and an equal percentage considers it likely that a cancer patient will become infected with a MDR pathogen. Despite these concerns, only 48% ( This survey highlights the urgent need for educating and training oncologists on AMR, as well as the importance of the development of oncology-specific guidelines to mitigate the impact of AMR in this high-risk population.",

Evaluation of the quantity and appropriateness of common antifungal prescriptions like fluconazole is essential in the development of these programmes. To perform a clinical audit of fluconazole prescribing and explore whether involvement of pharmacy students in this process was feasible and meaningful from both pharmacy student and health system perspectives. An audit was conducted of all fluconazole prescriptions from January 2024 to March 2024 at two Sydney hospitals. Trained pharmacy students, under the supervision of antimicrobial stewardship pharmacists and physicians, completed the audit using the Antifungal National Antimicrobial Prescribing Survey audit tool. Prescriptions were assessed for their compliance to guidelines and appropriateness. Data on pharmacy students' educational experience was collected by a 5-point Likert scale survey. A total of 145 fluconazole prescriptions were audited: 34 for empiric therapy, 56 for directed therapy, and 56 for prophylaxis. A total of 91 (62.8%) prescriptions were assessed as appropriate, 46 (31.7%) were inappropriate, and 8 (5.5%) were not assessable. Potential drug-drug interactions were identified in 17 patients receiving fluconazole doses of 200\u00a0mg or greater, of which three were clinically significant, requiring intervention. Students had positive experiences contributing to quality use of medicines, in terms of enjoyment, support, and education. Inappropriate fluconazole use was common. Pharmacy students made a positive contribution to the antifungal audit, promoting good stewardship practises for the hospital while accessing enhanced learning and development opportunities. A multisite clinical audit of 145 fluconazole prescriptions found 62.8% were appropriate, 31.7% inappropriate. Pharmacy students played a vital role in the audit by identifying drug interactions and gaining valuable learning experiences. Their involvement supported antifungal stewardship efforts.",

Provisional reprocessing of reusable surgical instruments seems possible using high-level chemical disinfection with hydrogen peroxide (3% for 150 minutes or 7.5% for 30 minutes) in case of necessity due to logistic breakdowns and patients that need immediate treatment.

    "abstract": "Given the ongoing global threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), largely fueled by self-medication with antibiotics (SMA), this study offers important insights from southern Tehran-an underrepresented region in national data-regarding the prevalence and determinants of SMA. We investigated several previously underexplored key factors, including socioeconomic status (SES), education, lifestyle, mental health, and COVID-19 history. A population-based cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted in three major regions of southern Tehran in 2023, involving 1,311 adult participants who were selected through stratified random sampling with probability proportional to size. A structured composite index was developed using data on lifestyle factors such as body mass index, physical activity, smoking, nutrition, mental and physical health, socioeconomic status, and frequency of SMA. Of the participants, 50.4% were male and 49.6% female, with an overall SMA prevalence of 21.3% (n\u2009=\u2009279). Higher education (AOR\u2009=\u20091.93, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.25-2.96, p\u2009value\u2009=\u20090.003), higher SES (AOR\u2009=\u20093.59, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.82-6.82, p\u2009value\u2009<\u20090.001), basic insurance (AOR\u2009=\u20091.69, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.10-2.63, p\u2009value\u2009=\u20090.019), and a history of uncomplicated COVID-19 infection (AOR\u2009=\u20092.30, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.44-3.78, p\u2009value\u2009=\u20090.001) were significantly associated with increased SMA. In contrast, a healthy lifestyle (AOR\u2009=\u20090.66, p\u2009value\u2009=\u20090.033) and good mental health (AOR\u2009=\u20090.31, p\u2009value\u2009<\u20090.001) were associated with lower SMA rates. Our findings primarily suggest that we should focus our public health efforts on specific subpopulations affected by SMA. Community-based antibiotic stewardship programs should use educational and behavioral approaches with an emphasis on mental health and health literacy. Policymakers should also consider whether to modify regulations to prevent the general public from obtaining antibiotics without a prescription.

Pharmacists play a key role in ASPs through patient education, prescription monitoring, and promoting appropriate use. This study assessed the status of ASPs in primary healthcare centres (PHCs) in S\u00e3o Paulo state from the pharmacists' perspective. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between June 2023 and January 2024 among pharmacists working in PHCs across S\u00e3o Paulo. The questionnaire, based on CDC and ANVISA guidelines, addressed demographics, PHC characteristics, ASP activities, and pharmaceutical interventions. Descriptive statistics were used. Of 201 responses, 189 were eligible, representing PHCs in 68 cities. Most pharmacists (75%) had postgraduate education, and 70% worked in centres serving over 500 patients. Although 79% of PHCs used electronic medical records, only 32% had written ASP policies and 29% monitored antimicrobial use. Diagnostic resources were limited; respiratory virus tests were the most available (43%). Educational activities on antimicrobial use occurred in 26% of PHCs. Pharmaceutical interventions were reported by 77% of pharmacists, mainly related to dosage (54%) and treatment duration (25%), with high prescriber acceptance (\u226580% in 34% of cases). This study identified strengths and gaps in ASP implementation across PHCs. While improvements were seen in infrastructure and pharmacist training, key limitations remain in policy development, diagnostics, prescriber support, and public education. We recommend: (1) establishing local ASP policies, (2) expanding access to rapid diagnostics, (3) continuing education for prescribers and pharmacists, and (4) public awareness campaigns tailored to primary care.",

    "abstract": "Maternal health is pivotal in India, where infections significantly drive maternal morbidity and mortality. While antibiotics are essential for preventing sepsis, neonatal Group B Streptococcus, and surgical site infections (SSI), their misuse-fueled by empirical prescribing, self-medication, and over-the-counter access-has escalated antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This challenge is compounded by India's high maternal mortality, uneven healthcare resources, and cultural practices. Tailored, hospital-specific antibiotic policies, grounded in local epidemiology, resistance patterns, and resources, are critical to optimizing use and enhancing care quality. This narrative review synthesized National (ICMR, NCDC) and International (WHO, ACOG) guidelines, local resistance data, antibiograms. epidemiological studies, and stewardship interventions related to maternal infections. Key sources included the WHO AWaRe antibiotic classification and local antibiograms. Antibiotics are classified into first, second and third-line treatments for various obstetric conditions and treatments based on patient demographics, resources, and resistance patterns, with ongoing policy evaluation adapted to hospital-specific needs. Recommendations were adapted to local resistance patterns, resource availability, and patient demographics. Excessive antibiotic use exacerbates AMR and adverse outcomes, but hospital-specific policies prioritizing narrow-spectrum agents, guided by local antibiograms shown less complications. Incorporating stewardship measures (e.g., prophylaxis criteria, formulary restrictions, audits, and education) improved guideline adherence, curbed broad- spectrum use, and bolstered neonatal safety. Implementing hospital-specific antibiotic policies effectively reduces infection rates and improves maternal-neonatal outcomes through standardized regimens prioritizing narrow-spectrum antibiotics and utilizing local antibiograms. Key stewardship strategies included defined prophylaxis protocols, formulary restrictions, and ongoing education, all contributing to enhanced maternal and neonatal safety. Hospital-specific antibiotic policies provide an evidence-based framework for optimizing antibiotic use in obstetrics by aligning national and international guidelines with local epidemiological and resistance data. These tailored policies strengthen antimicrobial stewardship and clinical decision-making, mitigate AMR, and improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. Implementing such frameworks in India's diverse healthcare landscape is vital to safeguarding treatment efficacy, improving outcomes amid rising resistance and effective maternal healthcare delivery in India.",

Adult studies suggest antibiotic prophylaxis for elective cholecystectomy may not be needed. Our quality improvement project aimed to decrease prophylactic antibiotic use for elective cholecystectomies from 100 % to \u226450 % and maintain that rate for one year. Prior to initiation, the pre-operative orderset was modified, education was provided, and surgeon consensus was achieved. All patients undergoing elective minimally invasive (laparoscopic and robotic) cholecystectomy were included. Exclusion criteria included acute cholecystitis, immunocompromised state, or performance of a combined procedure. Compliance was measured by chart review, with feedback provided for noncompliance. The project was initiated January 2024. Data were collected for twelve months prior (1/23-12/23) and after initiation (1/24-12/24). The balancing measure was surgical site infection (SSI). Ninety patients met inclusion criteria (40 pre-protocol and 50 post-protocol). Median age at surgery was 16 years (IQR 14, 17.2). Seventy-seven (86 %) patients were female. Prior to implementation, all patients (n = 40) received prophylactic antibiotics. In the first three months post-implementation, 3/16 (19 %) received antibiotic prophylaxis (due to inadequate communication with anesthesia providers). In the subsequent nine months, 0/34 (0 %) received antibiotic prophylaxis. One (2.5 %) patient in the pre-implementation group was noted to have an SSI requiring antibiotics vs. 3 (6 %) patients in the post-implementation group (p = 0.43). Use of prophylactic antibiotics for elective minimally invasive cholecystectomy decreased from 100 % to 6 % without significantly increasing the rate of SSI. Appropriately decreasing use of prophylactic antibiotics can improve antibiotic stewardship efforts. Level III.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a significant global public health threat that undermines sustainable development. In Benin, high AMR rates to common antibiotics, including last-resort treatments, exacerbate infection outcomes and healthcare costs. Inappropriate antibiotic use worsens this challenge. To address these issues, Benin implemented its National Multisectoral AMR Action Plan 2019-2024. This study aims to assess the implementation of Benin's National AMR Action Plan 2019-2024 and identify critical gaps for future updates. The evaluation covered six of Benin's 12 departments, engaging stakeholders from human, animal and environmental health sectors. A retrospective cross-sectional evaluation was performed from 05 August 2024 to 30 September 2024. Data were collected through a documentary review, standardised questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and group discussions. An executed scoring grid and a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats analysis were used. Of the 224 planned activities, 40.18% were not initiated, 31.25% had started, 19.64% were partially executed, 5.36% were nearly completed and only 3.57% were fully implemented. Critical gaps included the lack of a fully operational multisectoral coordination group, limited financial resources, inadequate surveillance systems, insufficient communication and education initiatives and the absence of infection prevention and control (IPC) programmes. Despite progress in regulatory frameworks, gaps in coordination, resources, surveillance and IPC hinder effective AMR control in Benin. Strengthening governance, communication and addressing other identified gaps are critical for future success. This evaluation provides evidence-based recommendations to update Benin's AMR strategy within a 'One Health' framework.",

    "abstract": "This intervention utilized the Health Belief Model and Theory of Planned Behavior to address the knowledge and social barriers that increase dairy farm workers' risk to antimicrobial-resistant infections. Dairy farm workers gained a significant increase in knowledge of the 8 desired outcomes, related to occupational health skills that reduce risks, from our intervention. Limited time was a major barrier as to why dairy farm workers felt like they could not make behavioral changes that would reduce their occupational health risk. Dairy farmworkers showed a strong likelihood of making workplace health-related behavioral changes, but their intention to change was weaker in areas of personal antibiotic stewardship. This study focused on developing and evaluating an educational intervention designed to mitigate occupational health risks associated with pathogens and antibiotic-resistant bacteria among dairy farm workers. Data collected from farms and workers as part of a larger umbrella project that focused on dairy farm antibiotic use for cows and calves were used to inform elements of the Health Belief Model and the Theory of Planned Behavior, leading to eight intervention outcomes. The intervention targeted increased knowledge and promoted behavioral changes related to worker and workplace hygiene best practices, PPE use, biosecurity, and personal antibiotic stewardship. Educational materials included instructional videos, fact sheets in English and Spanish, and supplementary printed material, including illustrated take-home points, content summaries, and posters. The intervention was conducted with 32 workers from five dairy farms, using pre- and post-intervention assessments to measure knowledge gains and behavioral intentions. Results demonstrated statistically significant increases in knowledge across all targeted outcomes (p-value \u2264 .001), with most participants showing a high willingness and likelihood to implement recommended behaviors related to their workplace exposures and best practices. However, participants indicated a greater reluctance to change around issues of personal antibiotic stewardship. Time constraints were the most significant and most consistent barrier to behavior change. The study highlights the importance of ongoing research and refinement of intervention strategies to address barriers and enhance protective practices among often underserved farmworkers in agriculture. These intervention strategies contribute to improved occupational health outcomes with benefits to public health by reducing the spread of antibiotic-resistant infections to the broader population.",

Evaluating doctors\u2019 prescribing practices is crucial for improving antibiotic stewardship and minimizing resistance. This study evaluated the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of doctors concerning antibiotic prescribing and to identify factors influencing their prescribing behaviours at Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Edo State, Nigeria. A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted from January to August 2024 among 205 doctors selected randomly from five department. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS version 23. This study included 205 doctors, with mean age of 31.5 years. Most of the participants were males (60.5%), Christians (84.4%) and from Esan ethnic group. The survey revealed that 142 (69.3%) of the participants had good knowledge of antibiotic prescribing, and 185 (90.2%) and 189 (92.2%) of the clinicians reported adhering to hospital and international guidelines, respectively. Despite this, only 73 (35.6%) had attended recent training on antibiotic use. Influencing factors included poor-quality antibiotics 113 (55.1%) and increased clinical experience 99 (48.3%). Although 99 (48.3%) of the clinicians felt confident in their prescribing abilities, prescription alterations by senior colleagues were noted. Doctors at Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital generally possess good knowledge and adherence to antibiotic guidelines. However, insufficient training and poor-quality antibiotics are barriers to optimal prescribing practices. Enhancing continuous education and improving drug quality are essential to advancing antibiotic stewardship and combating resistance.

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and zoonotic diseases are global public health threats with serious implications for human, animal, and environmental health. In South Africa, AMR and zoonotic disease outbreaks pose significant threats to public health and food security. Despite a robust AMR surveillance system for human health, the absence of a national routine surveillance program for livestock hinders a comprehensive One Health (OH) approach. The 2024 UK-South Africa workshop in Cape Town convened key stakeholders from human and animal health, environmental sciences, and food production to address these challenges. Discussions focused on integrating OH surveillance, leveraging Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) for early outbreak detection, and improving food and water safety. Workshop outcomes emphasized the necessity of cross-sector collaboration to enhance AMR monitoring and outbreak preparedness. Stakeholder engagement, particularly within agricultural communities, was identified as critical for OH implementation. Participants highlighted the need for culturally sensitive engagement strategies, qualitative research methods, and policy reforms to drive adoption. Lessons from tuberculosis (TB) and HIV programs informed strategies for fostering compliance and integrating OH principles into veterinary education, particularly in antimicrobial stewardship. Challenges such as resource limitations, bioinformatics capacity gaps, and resistance to new technologies were addressed through recommendations for joint consortia, leveraging existing infrastructure, and targeted training. Aligning OH initiatives with consumer-driven concerns, such as water quality monitoring, was also identified as a key opportunity. Moving forward, translating research into action will require sustained collaboration, policy alignment, and community engagement. Strengthening OH surveillance can enhance South Africa's ability to prevent and control infectious diseases, ensuring long-term public health resilience and food security.",

Sixty-seven providers completed the survey. Most (64%) providers reported reviewing best practice guidelines and educational materials on a regular basis. Providers were most interested in patient-facing educational materials that would help support best practices. However, substantial variability existed in responses about antibiotic prescribing; some (15%) respondents stated that they rarely review guidelines or use antibiotic stewardship resources. Providers felt that any feedback about antibiotic prescribing practices should be provided via email and should focus on reducing antibiotic use for viral conditions. Missouri survey respondents generally support appropriate antibiotic use to address antibiotic resistance. However, findings also suggest that delivering resources to targeted populations of over-prescribers may be beneficial.

Previously, our institution had a 95.7 % rate of discharge on oral antibiotics and was an outlier compared to NSQIP-P peer hospitals. We aimed to decrease oral antibiotics at discharge to 35 % by the end of 2024 while monitoring balancing measures and outcomes. A multidisciplinary quality improvement team developed a CPG directing postoperative antibiotic utilization, clinically based discharge parameters, and indications for postoperative diagnostic imaging. Implementation began in April 2024 with provider education and an electronic health record order set. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients receiving oral antibiotics at discharge. Balancing measures were length of stay (LOS), organ-space surgical site infection (OSI), ED return and readmissions within 30 days. Data were analyzed using p-charts to detect special cause variation over the pre-implementation (01/2024-03/2024), transition (04/2024-06/2024), post-implementation (07/2024-09/2024) and maintenance (10/2024-12/2024) periods. 90.7 % of patients received oral antibiotics at discharge in the 3-month baseline pre-implementation period (n=43), with a mean LOS of 4 days (SD \u00b1 2.2), OSI rate 7 %, 12 % return ED visit rate, and 7 % readmission rate. After quality improvement interventions, oral antibiotic duration decreased over time, without impacting LOS, ED visits, Readmissions, or OSI rates.

    "abstract": "Effective antibiotics are a cornerstone of treatment for heavily immunocompromised patients such as those undergoing cancer treatment or transplantation procedures, as these patients are at particularly high risk of adverse outcomes from infections. However, rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threatens to undermine our ability to deliver modern treatments, and without action, recent advances in clinical care may be undone. In this narrative review, we examine the broad burdens of AMR for patients and healthcare systems, including excess mortality, underlying disease outcomes, economic costs and the damage to patients' quality of life. Despite the profound impact on individual wellbeing, the patient voice and patient-reported experience measures are largely absent from current research. To protect the everyday benefits of antibiotics, it is vital to educate all those involved in patient care on how we can combat AMR, including appropriate testing, use of effective antibiotics and infection control procedures. Moreover, given the high investment in novel anticancer treatments, good antimicrobial stewardship has the potential to deliver overall cost savings to healthcare systems while ensuring that patients can safely access and benefit from these therapies. Antibiotics are essential for people with serious health conditions like cancer or those who have received an organ transplant. These patients have weakened immune systems and are more likely to develop infections; however, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), where bacteria no longer respond to antibiotics, is making these infections harder to treat. This review looked at the impact of AMR in heavily immunocompromised patients. It found that resistant infections are common and can cause delays to cancer treatment, longer hospital stays and a higher risk of death. These infections can also reduce quality of life and increase healthcare costs. The review found that current efforts to manage AMR are inconsistent. There is a need for faster diagnostic testing, better education for healthcare providers and patients, and more consistent use of infection control and antibiotic stewardship programmes. These steps could help optimise the treatment of resistant bacteria and improve outcomes. As treatments like chemotherapy and organ transplantation are very costly, preventing infections and early mortality through better AMR management could also help reduce overall healthcare spending. The review highlights the importance of improving awareness, strengthening hospital systems and investing in new antibiotics so that patients continue to benefit from modern medical treatments.",

    "journal": "Current opinion in critical care",
    "abstract": "To highlight the unintended consequences of microbiological test results in driving inappropriate antimicrobial prescriptions, and to evaluate strategies - particularly from the perspective of diagnostic stewardship - that may mitigate this issue. Despite the critical role of microbiological data in guiding appropriate antimicrobial therapy, several studies have demonstrated that misinterpretation of such results frequently leads to unnecessary treatments. Common pitfalls include overinterpretation of positive cultures from poorly collected or clinically unwarranted samples, misclassification of colonization vs. infection, and excessive reliance on test results in the absence of supporting clinical evidence. Emerging diagnostic stewardship interventions - ranging from restricting sample processing and modifying test reporting to implementing decision support tools - have shown promising outcomes in reducing overtreatment without compromising patient safety. Specific examples include urine and wound cultures, respiratory specimens, and the diagnosis of Clostridioides difficile infection. Furthermore, educational and system-level strategies such as the BLADDER score or selective result reporting can improve decision-making at various stages of the diagnostic process. Microbiology laboratories play a pivotal role in antimicrobial stewardship and must actively support clinicians in avoiding diagnostic and therapeutic errors. While evidence supports multiple approaches to mitigate inappropriate prescriptions driven by microbiology results, their successful implementation requires interdisciplinary collaboration, tailored interventions, and ongoing evaluation of clinical impact. Diagnostic stewardship, when aligned with clinician education and robust reporting practices, is a crucial component in enhancing the accuracy of infection diagnosis and reducing antimicrobial overuse.",

We performed a retrospective analysis of systemic antibiotic administration in fire-affected koalas admitted to two wildlife treatment facilities during the catastrophic Australian wildfires in 2019-2020, to assess the practice of antimicrobial stewardship during a wildlife emergency. Triage and treatment records were obtained for fire-affected koalas (n\u2009=\u2009355) admitted to two facilities during the wildfires. Analyses showed that 40.3% of koalas at Facility A and 35.0% of koalas at Facility B received systemic antibiotics. The majority of antibiotics (63.9%, comprising multiple types of beta-lactams) administered to koalas at Facility A were prophylactic treatments in koalas with noninfected moderate to severe cutaneous burn wounds. The majority of antibiotics (75.0%, comprising chloramphenicol and enrofloxacin) administered to koalas at Facility B were chlamydial disease treatments. Overall, 29.4% of all antibiotic treatments (predominantly beta-lactams and enrofloxacin) were administered for recorded clinical infections. Where koala-specific guidelines and protocols for treating burn wounds were not available, there was an overuse of systemic antibiotics and frequently sub-optimal antibiotic stewardship in burnt koalas during the 2019-2020 wildfire emergency response. Best practice antibiotic prescribing was also not always feasible due to a shortage of first-choice antibiotics (e.g., injectable chloramphenicol for chlamydial disease). This study highlights the importance of preparedness for future wildfire events and identifies a need for equipping veterinarians with guidelines for treating fire-affected koalas during emergency situations. Additional education, guidance and resources are required to enable appropriate antimicrobial stewardship by responding veterinarians during wildlife emergencies.",

A descriptive analysis was performed, a Pearson's chi-square test and a two-sample Wilcoxon (Mann-Whitney U) rank-sum test were used to assess the impact of the interventions. Most (n\u2009=\u2009220/300, 73.33%) of the patients were between the ages of 24-44 years, and the commonest surgery was an emergency caesarean section (n\u2009=\u200992/300, 30.67%). After the AMS interventions, there was a significant improvement in guideline compliance due to appropriate antibiotic choice (p\u2009=\u20090.001). duration (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and the volume of consumption of SAP (p\u2009<\u20090.001). There were no significant changes in the timing of administration (p\u2009=\u20090.636), SSI rate (p\u2009=\u20090.054), and the length of hospital stay (p\u2009=\u20090.161). Our study showed positive impact of the two AMS interventions on SAP guideline compliance based on the choice and duration of prescription, and reduction of the volume of antibiotic utilization, but not on the timing of administration. This did not worsen the SSI rate and patient length of stay. Hospitals in Ghana and beyond are encouraged to optimize SAP use and prevent rising AMR rates by implementing appropriate educational programmes and dissemination of audit findings.",

    "abstract": "The high prevalence of diabetes mellitus and related consequences in all populations of the world makes their management an important challenge in endodontic practice. This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes, and performance of Iranian endodontists regarding the management of diabetic patients. Questionnaires with 18 items were distributed to Iranian endodontists from different geographical provinces of Iran using social media. Responses to each question used a five-point Likert scale. Data for responses were analyzed using Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. A total of 101 valid responses were returned for analysis (50 men and 51 women). None of the respondents had aggregated scores that were rated as unfavorable on 3 domains. Knowledge was rated as favorable for 81% and acceptable for the remaining 19%. Attitude was rated as favorable for 63%, and acceptable for 37%, while performance was rated as favorable for 98% and acceptable for the remaining 2%. Also, none of the 3 variables under evaluation were influenced by demographic factors or by work experience. The most common areas of uncertainty for respondents were monitoring blood for glucose or glycated hemoglobin concentration, and decisions regarding when to prescribe antibiotics. Overall, this cohort of endodontists displayed a high level of knowledge of the major issues involved in diabetic patient care and were confident in providing clinical care. Future programs for continuing professional development for endodontists should consider current methods used for monitoring blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin, both as point-of-care or personal devices. In addition, further education is needed on antibiotic stewardship.",

    "abstract": "Understanding prescribing patterns is essential for developing targeted interventions to promote rational antimicrobial use. This study evaluated antimicrobial prescribing patterns among pediatric outpatients at primary healthcare centers (PHCs) in Bujumbura Mairie, republic of Burundi. We conducted a cross-sectional study at 20 PHCs in Bujumbura Mairie, Republic of Burundi, to evaluate antimicrobial prescribing patterns. We collected retrospectively 2022-year data from medical records using the World Health Organization/International Network of Rational Use of Drugs (WHO/INRUD) core drug indicators. According to these WHO guidelines, a minimum sample size of 600 prescriptions is recommended to assess drug use indicators. To meet this requirement, a total of 800 paediatric outpatient prescriptions were sampled. Prescriptions for inpatients were excluded. A total of 497 (62.1%) out of 800 prescriptions contained antimicrobials, far exceeding WHO recommendations (20-26.8%). Younger patients, particularly children under five, received the highest proportion of antimicrobial prescriptions (15.6%). Although generic prescribing (95.0%) and adherence to the National Essential Medicine Lists (NEML) (95.8%) were high, they fell short of WHO benchmarks (100%). Most prescriptions followed monotherapy (92.8%) with a low average of 1.1 antimicrobials per prescription (WHO guidelines 1.6-1.8). Although Access-group dominated (71.3%), Watch-group usage (25.3%) surpassed the recommended threshold (<\u200920%), and WHO non-recommended fixed-dose combinations were also prescribed (3.4%). In addition, 26.2% of prescriptions lacked documented indications. The present study highlights strong adherence to essential medicine lists and generic antimicrobial use. However, findings also reveal areas for improvement, including the need for documentation of indication and reduction of utilization of Watch group antibiotic use. To optimize antimicrobial use and prevent AMR in Burundi's paediatric population, further national research, healthcare worker training, diagnostics, and antimicrobial stewardship implementation are necessary.",

We included hospitalised patients who had a blood culture prescription. Bacteria isolated in the Mini-Lab were sent to a reference laboratory for confirmation. Ease of use was assessed using a self-administered questionnaire after training and up to 8 months after. Isolated from 960 blood cultures between Sept 2021 and Feb 2022, 76 pathogens were sent for confirmation. The concordance of bacterial identification between the Mini-Lab and the reference method was 97% (74/76) at genus level and 90% (68/76) at species level. Antibiogram showed very good category concordances (\u226590%) between the Mini-Lab and the reference methods for most antibiotics. The Mini-Lab was perceived as easy to use by the laboratory technicians. The Mini-Lab, routinely implemented in a district hospital in combination with an antimicrobial stewardship programme showed good performances and usability by nonexpert laboratory staff.

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is a worldwide problem caused by the inappropriate use of antibiotics. In Australia, antibiotics are frequently prescribed in general practice (primary care) settings for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) despite these infections most commonly being caused by viruses. The Optimal Implementation of Antimicrobial Stewardship in General Practice (OptimasGP) study aims to provide implementation support for effective antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) interventions for ARIs. The current study will examine if a redesigned workflow, and an AMS Toolbox containing AMS resources, is an acceptable way to access AMS interventions and clinical data collected in general practice settings. A mixed-methods approach will be applied using a single-arm, pragmatic exploratory study. Data will be collected for a period of 3\u00a0months. Data collection from general practice settings in New South Wales, Australia, will involve the participation of 4 to 6 practices, 12 general practitioners (GPs), and 6 to 8 practice staff. We also aim to recruit 50-100 patients to complete surveys and 12 patients to participate in focus group discussions. Participating GPs and practice staff will be provided with an online AMS Toolbox to facilitate access to AMS resources. Two hours of online training and a reminder card will also be provided. The AMS Toolbox will contain AMS resources for shared decision-making, clinical decision support (including point-of-care testing), and delayed antibiotic prescribing in patients with ARIs. The primary outcome of the study will be the acceptability of the AMS Toolbox to GPs, practice staff, and patients. Secondary outcomes will include recruitment and completion rates, qualitative findings from the focus group discussions, resource use and antibiotic prescription rates, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), and patient-reported experience measures (PREMS). AMS interventions are needed to help reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for ARIs in general practice settings. The findings of this study will inform a hybrid type 3 implementation trial.

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global health concern, with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remaining a leading cause of hospitalization and empirical antibiotic use. However, adherence to clinical guidelines in CAP management is inconsistent, particularly in resource-limited settings. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a complex antimicrobial stewardship intervention on the quality of antibacterial therapy and diagnostic practices in hospitalized patients with CAP in Aktobe, Kazakhstan. A 12-month pre- and post-intervention study was conducted in two multidisciplinary hospitals. The intervention included educational sessions, implementation of protocol-based care, and improved access to diagnostic tools. Key indicators assessed included adherence to national antibiotic guidelines, use of severity scoring tools, timely antibiotic administration, microbiological diagnostics, and step-down therapy. Significant improvements were observed in several indicators: guideline-adherent antibiotic prescribing increased from 75% to 93.5% (p < 0.001), step-down therapy from 2.7% to 8.2% (p = 0.021), and use of CURB-65/CRB-65 from 0% to 8.7% (p < 0.001). Use of urinary antigen tests increased from 0% to 12% (p < 0.001), while evaluation of antibiotic effectiveness at 48-72\u00a0h rose from 40.2% to 70.1% (p < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression confirmed the independent impact of the intervention, adjusting for factors such as age, pneumonia severity, and shift type (day shift vs off-duty shift). A targeted, context-specific intervention significantly improved key quality indicators in CAP management. These findings support the effectiveness of multifaceted stewardship strategies in improving clinical practice and mitigating AMR.",

    "year": 2025,
    "journal": "Ewha medical journal",
    "abstract": "The rise of multidrug-resistant organisms represents a serious global public health concern. In Korea, the increasing prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) is particularly concerning due to the difficulties associated with treatment. Data from the Korea Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System indicate a yearly increase in CRE cases, with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales being the predominant type. The capacity of CRE to resist multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics leads to higher medical costs and mortality rates, underscoring the need for urgent action. Effective prevention is crucial to curbing CRE outbreaks and transmission. Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) play a key role and require commitment from healthcare professionals to minimize unnecessary antibiotic use, as well as from policymakers to ensure adherence to ASP guidelines. Given the complexity of CRE transmission, ASP efforts must be integrated with infection control strategies for maximum effectiveness. These strategies include adherence to standard and contact precautions, environmental disinfection, preemptive isolation, and comprehensive education and training for healthcare personnel. Additionally, surveillance testing for patients at high risk for CRE and the use of real-time diagnostic kits can facilitate early detection and reduce further transmission. Strategies for the prevention of CRE infection should be tailored to specific healthcare settings. Ongoing research is essential to update and refine infection control guidelines and effectively prevent CRE outbreaks.",

We performed an evaluation of ASPs in Latin American HCFs from March 2022 to February 2023 using a structured self-assessment survey associated with a scoring system that evaluated leadership support and accountability, resources, antibiotic stewardship actions, education, and antibiotic use (AU) monitoring and reporting. Additionally, we collected monthly AU data (antibiotic consumption and point prevalence surveys) and number of multidrug-resistant infections in medical-surgical intensive care units. Self-assessment scores were correlated with AU through multivariable regression models adjusting for bed size, country of HCF, and incidence of infections (when appropriate). Of the 39 HCFs recruited for the study, all completed the self-assessment, 36 performed the point prevalence survey, and 29 collected antibiotic consumption data. The overall median self-assessment score was 252.5 (IQR, 212.5-285) for a maximum possible score of 335. A high self-assessment score (top quartile) was associated with higher guideline-compliant AU (odds ratio [OR], 8.63; 95% CI, 3.03-24.6;  Higher-level ASP implementation in Latin American HCFs correlated with better compliance with AU guidelines and decreased the use of vancomycin in the intensive care unit, supporting the need to improve resources for ASPs.",

    "abstract": "Introduction The use of carbapenem antibiotics is a known risk factor for the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), a growing global public health concern. In this study, we focused on cases where carbapenems were selected as the initial empirical therapy and where early intervention strategies were implemented to assess and potentially modify such prescribing practices. Our primary aim was to evaluate changes in carbapenem usage following the initiation of early interventions and to determine whether these measures contributed to more appropriate antimicrobial use. Additionally, by analyzing cases subject to intervention, we sought to identify key factors that can help prevent the unnecessary initial selection of carbapenems. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of cases subjected to early intervention for carbapenem use over a one-year period from April 2024 to March 2025. In principle, early intervention involved clinical rounds or review of medical records within 24 hours of carbapenem initiation. When antibiotics were deemed necessary to be changed or discontinued, this was documented in the medical record, and feedback was provided. Interventions were classified into four categories: (1) no recommendation for change (appropriate use), (2) recommendation to switch to an alternative agent (change in empirical therapy), (3) recommendation for de-escalation, and (4) recommendation for discontinuation. For categories (2) to (4), we also collected data on whether the recommendations were accepted. Carbapenem use was assessed using days of therapy (DOT) and antimicrobial use density (AUD). Monthly trends in DOT and AUD before and after the start of the intervention program were analyzed. In addition, we evaluated annual changes in the use of carbapenems and other broad-spectrum antibiotics. Results Between April 2024 and March 2025, early interventions were conducted in 377 cases. Among these, 220 cases (58%) were deemed appropriate and required no change in therapy. The second most common category comprised 106 cases (28%) in which a switch to an alternative agent was recommended. In 33 cases (9%), de-escalation was suggested based on the identification of the causative pathogen, and antimicrobial susceptibility results were available at the time of intervention. In 18 cases (5%), no evidence of infection was found, and antibiotics were considered unnecessary. The acceptance rate of recommendations was generally favorable across all categories. Following the implementation of early intervention, both the DOT\u00a0and AUD\u00a0for carbapenems showed a notable decline. Conclusion Early intervention after prescribing carbapenem was associated with a reduction in both AUD and DOT, suggesting improved antimicrobial stewardship. These findings underscore the importance of appropriate empirical antibiotic selection in minimizing unnecessary carbapenem use. To curb the inappropriate initial use of carbapenems, it is essential to follow the fundamental principles of infectious disease management when selecting antibiotics and to accurately interpret culture and susceptibility data. Interventions and education focused on these areas are crucial for promoting responsible antimicrobial prescribing.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global health crisis, disproportionately affecting developing countries. A key driver is the chain of wrong diagnosis leading to inappropriate antimicrobial use. Misclassification of infections-such as viral illnesses mistaken for bacterial infections-and failure to identify infection sources needing drainage or debridement result in unnecessary or ineffective antimicrobial therapy. This accelerates AMR, compels reliance on high-end antimicrobials, and fosters emergence of extensively drug-resistant pathogens. Compounding factors include sample contamination, absence of diagnostic-laboratory feedback loops, and empirical therapy without microbiological confirmation. Together, these perpetuate a vicious cycle of diagnostic error and AMR escalation. Strengthening diagnostic accuracy through point-of-care testing, molecular diagnostics, source control measures, and integration of diagnostic stewardship into antimicrobial stewardship programs is critical. Policy reforms, clinician education, and adoption of digital health innovations can support these efforts, breaking the cycle and preserving antimicrobial efficacy in resource-limited settings.",

A key driver of antimicrobial resistance is the inappropriate and excessive use of antibiotics, which accelerates the development of resistant strains. At the same time, the lack of new antibiotics in development exacerbates the crisis. In this context, promoting the appropriate and prudent use of antibiotics is essential to limit the emergence and spread of resistance.

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial Stewardship programs (ASPs) help reduce antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by promoting responsible antibiotic use. However, implementation is often inconsistent, especially in low-resource settings. Digital health technologies (DHTs) provide scalable and flexible means to enhance ASPs, particularly through targeted educational interventions for clinicians, students, and the public. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of digital educational within ASPs by enhancing knowledge and driving behavior change, with a specific focus on the educational strategies employed, their theoretical underpinnings, and their differential impact across populations and settings. This review followed PRISMA and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines, with a protocol registered in PROSPERO. A comprehensive search of four databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL) was conducted to identify primary peer-reviewed studies published in English that quantitatively evaluated digital educational ASPs. Risk of bias was assessed using standardized appraisal tools. Twenty-three studies, conducted in diverse contexts and targeting different stakeholders, were included in the review. All interventions reported positive impacts on knowledge enhancement and behavior change. Engagement-driven approaches, such as interactive modules, real-time feedback, and case-based simulations, were most common, and strategies were tailored to the specific target groups. However, theoretical underpinnings were rarely reported, with only two studies explicitly grounded in behavior change theory. Few studies included long-term follow-up assessments, and most lacked rigorous designs such as randomization. Risk of bias was assessed and varied across studies. The interventions varied widely in duration, frequency, and delivery format, limiting comparability. Digital educational ASPs show strong promise in improving knowledge and driving behavior change across a wide range of settings and stakeholder groups. Their adaptability, scalability, and user-centered design underscore their potential as valuable tools in the global effort to combat antimicrobial resistance. To maximize their long-term impact, future interventions should be informed by behavioral theory, include follow-up beyond six months, and address contextual needs in low-resource settings.",

More than 95% of PALs can be de-labeled when tested, but this rarely happens. We sought to determine whether education and an electronic health record (EHR) tool kit to identify low-risk PALs would facilitate inpatient penicillin allergy de-labeling by pharmacists. Pragmatic Removal of Penicillin Allergy Electronic Health Record Labels was a stepped-wedge, nonblinded, randomized, controlled, pragmatic clinical trial including 12 inpatient medical units. From November 2020 to November 2021, units entered intervention at 1-month stepped intervals in random order.

The intervention included pharmacist and nursing education, a patient list for systematic identification of PALs, presentation of a risk-assessment tool, and an oral amoxicillin challenge order set. The primary outcome was removal of PAL by hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included safety and implementation measures, longer-term continued label removal, and antibiotic use. On 12 randomized units, 2,052 patients with a PAL presented during the 1-year trial.

However, the extent to which sepsis guidelines are implemented across EDs in Europe remains unclear, and variability in adherence may impact patient outcomes. This study aimed to assess current sepsis management practices in European EDs, evaluate adherence to international guidelines, and identify key challenges limiting effective implementation. A structured survey was developed by sepsis experts from the European Society for Emergency Medicine (EUSEM). The questionnaire included both quantitative and open-ended items and underwent iterative refinement through pilot testing to ensure clarity and relevance. The survey was distributed to EUSEM members and national emergency medicine societies across Europe. Respondents included medical directors or designated sepsis specialists, with only one response requested per ED. A total of 402 EDs from 28 European countries participated in the survey. While most EDs (72.5%) reported having a sepsis protocol in place, less than half implemented regular monitoring or structured training measures. The 1-h sepsis bundle was described as moderately to highly challenging to implement by the majority of the respondents; just over half (55%) reported completing all its elements within 1\u2009h of ED presentation. Key barriers included high patient volumes, insufficient staffing, and lack of standardized sepsis definitions, leading to delays in recognition and treatment. The results also highlighted concerns regarding increased broad-spectrum antibiotic use following the implementation of the 1-h bundle, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach that considers antimicrobial stewardship. This survey establishes a benchmark for understanding sepsis management practices in European EDs, identifying substantial variations and challenges. Areas for improvement include enhanced training to follow protocols, improved monitoring systems that measure protocol adherence, and alignment with evidence-based guidelines.",

    "abstract": "The global emergence of multiresistant pathogens threatens the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapies and calls for a\u00a0rational use of antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals. The main reason for the development of resistance is the inappropriate use of these substances in human and veterinary medicine and agriculture. Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) combines strategies for optimizing prescribing practices in order to prevent the development of resistance, ensure successful treatment, and minimize side effects. Central elements are evidence-based guidelines, interdisciplinary visits, infectious disease consults, targeted training, feedback systems, and digital support. AMS is becoming increasingly established in Germany, but many antibiotics are still not prescribed in line with guidelines. Correct diagnosis, guideline-based empirical therapy, regular re-evaluation, dose adjustment, early oral administration, and outpatient parenteral anti-infective therapy (OPAT) are essential. Short, individually adapted treatment durations improve tolerability and reduce resistance pressure. AMS links epidemiological data with patient-specific factors and is key in personalized infection medicine. Only the consistent integration of AMS measures into everyday clinical practice can ensure the sustained efficacy of antimicrobial substances and improve the quality of patient care in the long term. Das weltweite Auftreten multiresistenter Erreger bedroht die Wirksamkeit antimikrobieller Therapien und fordert ein Umdenken im Umgang mit Antibiotika, Virostatika und Antimykotika. Hauptursache f\u00fcr die Resistenzentwicklung ist der h\u00e4ufig unsachgem\u00e4\u00dfe Einsatz dieser Substanzen in Human- und Veterin\u00e4rmedizin sowie in der Landwirtschaft. Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) b\u00fcndelt Strategien zur Optimierung der Verschreibungspraxis, um Resistenzentwicklung zu verhindern, Therapieerfolge zu sichern und Nebenwirkungen zu minimieren. Zentrale Elemente sind die Etablierung evidenzbasierter Leitlinien, interdisziplin\u00e4rer Visiten, eines infektiologischen Konsilwesens, gezielter Schulungen und von Feedbacksystemen. In Deutschland etabliert sich AMS zunehmend, dennoch werden viele Antiinfektiva weiterhin nicht leitliniengerecht verordnet. Die korrekte Infektionsdiagnosestellung, leitlinienbasierte empirische Therapie, regelm\u00e4\u00dfige Reevaluation, Dosisanpassung, fr\u00fchzeitige Oralisierung sowie die ambulante parenterale Antiinfektivatherapie (APAT) sind essenzielle AMS-Werkzeuge. Kurze, individuell angepasste Therapiedauern verbessern die Vertr\u00e4glichkeit und reduzieren Resistenzdruck.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate antibiotic prescription knowledge and practices among Oman Medical Specialty Board (OMSB) paediatric residents. The goal was to identify educational opportunities to reduce antimicrobial resistance and improve patient care. A survey-based cross-sectional study was conducted among the OMSB paediatric residents from August 2023 to September 2023. The online survey involved three parts: residents' demographics, knowledge of 12 common paediatric infection scenarios and clinical practice. Participants were asked to choose the proper antibiotic choices and duration for each scenario. Data analysis was performed using SPSS. A total of 74 responses were obtained, resulting in an 84% response rate. No significant differences were observed in the knowledge of antibiotic prescriptions among paediatric residents at different stages of their residency. The highest knowledge-based adherence rate to local antibiotic guidelines was noted in the acute sinusitis scenario (n = 70; 94.6%), followed by the acute meningitis scenario (n = 68; 91.9%). Conversely, the lowest adherence was observed in the acute otitis media (n = 16; 21.6%), followed by cellulitis (n = 23; 31.1%). Residents exhibited proficient clinical judgement by consulting infectious disease specialists when required based on the scenarios provided. The low knowledge-based adherence to antibiotic guidelines for common paediatric infections, coupled with the lack of significant differences in antibiotic knowledge between senior and junior paediatric residents, underscores the need for collective educational interventions. These interventions aim to advance knowledge and skills in antimicrobial stewardship and local antibiotic guidelines application.",

A mixed-methods study, conducted from January to March 2025, surveyed 100 healthcare professionals (32% surgeons, 28% nurses, and 18% infection control specialists) across public, private, and rural hospitals in all Pakistani provinces. Quantitative data from a structured questionnaire were analyzed using chi-square tests and logistic regression, while qualitative responses were thematically analyzed using Braun and Clarke's framework. Quantitatively, only 8% of facilities screened all surgical patients for MRSA, with 46% performing no screening, and 38% achieved 51-70% hand hygiene compliance, correlating with higher MRSA-SSI rates (odds ratio = 3.42, p < 0.001). Qualitatively, key themes included resource scarcity (e.g., \"We often share a single dispenser\"), staff resistance, and systemic inefficiencies. Strengthening hand hygiene, selective MRSA screening, and surgical bundles, alongside improved training and resource allocation, can reduce MRSA-SSIs in Pakistan. Tailoring global guidelines to local constraints is essential for effective implementation. These findings guide strategies to enhance surgical safety in resource-limited settings.",

    "abstract": "Porphyromonas gingivalis is a key pathogen associated with periodontal disease linked to various systemic conditions. Accurate identification of P. gingivalis proteins is essential for understanding its pathogenicity and developing targeted interventions. Recent advances in whole-genome sequencing of P. gingivalis have enhanced the detection and classification of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants, aiding in the early identification of resistance trends and improving patient care. In this study, we developed a deep learning approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify P. gingivalis proteins based on their amino acid sequences. A dataset of 685 protein sequences, including 150 P. gingivalis proteins and 535 nonresistant variants, was compiled and split into training (60%), validation (20%), and test (20%) sets. The sequences were preprocessed by padding to 750 amino acids and one-hot encoded into a feature matrix. A CNN model, consisting of two convolutional layers, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers for binary classification, was designed and implemented in PyTorch with 6192,258 parameters. The model was trained using the Adam optimizer for 30 epochs with early stopping based on validation accuracy. The CNN model outperforms traditional methods like BLAST, HMM Profiles, and DeepSig in predicting and classifying AMR in P. gingivalis. The hypothetical ProtBERT model shows slightly better performance, with an accuracy of 97%. Key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the area under the curve were assessed. CNN and ProtBERT have high recall rates (0.93 and 0.95, respectively), indicating their effectiveness in predicting AMR classifications. Our CNN model outperforms SOTA methods in classifying P. gingivalis-resistant protein sequences, achieving 96.35% accuracy and an area under the curve of 0.98. Precise and rapid prediction of AMR based solely on protein sequences, potentially leading to earlier identification of resistance trends and improved antibiotic stewardship in periodontal treatment.",

    "abstract": "Penicillin allergy labels are common in older adults and long-term care (LTC) residents, contributing to inappropriate antibiotic use, adverse outcomes, and increased healthcare costs. This review examines the prevalence, impact, safety, and barriers to penicillin allergy evaluation and de-labeling in these populations. This review synthesizes findings from studies on penicillin allergy prevalence, evaluation, and de-labeling practices in older adults and LTC settings. Articles were identified using searches in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Key data presented include de-labeling prevalence, safety of testing strategies including direct oral challenges, and barriers to implementation. Older adults and LTC residents exhibit higher penicillin allergy label prevalence than other populations, though true penicillin allergies are confirmed in a minority of tested individuals. Penicillin allergy labels result in reliance on second-line antibiotics, which can be less effective and more broad-spectrum, leading to increased multidrug-resistant infections, healthcare-associated infections, and higher healthcare costs. Penicillin allergy evaluation using risk stratification and procedures, including direct oral challenges, has been shown to be safe, with minimal adverse reactions in older adults. Many patients with low-risk histories have been shown to be de-labeled by history alone, reducing the need for specialized allergy evaluation and testing. Barriers to implementation of de-labeling in older adults and LTC facilities include resource limitations, knowledge gaps, and safety concerns, whereas facilitators include multidisciplinary support, standardized protocols, and patient engagement. Penicillin allergy evaluation and de-labeling of inaccurate penicillin allergies in older adults and LTC settings is both feasible and safe, offering substantial benefits for individual patient care and broadly for antibiotic stewardship. Addressing implementation barriers through standardized protocols, provider education, and multidisciplinary collaboration may improve adoption and outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotics have transformed the treatment of infectious diseases, but their widespread misuse has fueled an alarming rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR), especially in low- and middle-income countries like Nigeria. Despite regulatory frameworks classifying antibiotics as prescription-only medicines, weak enforcement, self-medication, and informal drug sales have normalized inappropriate antibiotic use nationwide. A comprehensive narrative review was conducted, synthesizing evidence from peer-reviewed literature, surveillance reports from national and global health authorities, and policy documents. The review identifies key systemic, socioeconomic, and behavioral drivers of antibiotic misuse and their implications for clinical practice. Multiple factors, including weak pharmaceutical regulation, economic and geographic barriers to formal healthcare, public misconceptions, and poor pharmacovigilance, drive the misuse of antibiotics in Nigeria. These practices contribute to rising rates of multidrug-resistant infections, complicate routine procedures, increase treatment costs, and lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Clinicians face growing professional burnout due to repeated treatment failures and limited therapeutic options. The broader healthcare system is strained, and public trust in formal care is eroding. AMR in Nigeria is no longer a looming threat, it is a present crisis. Urgent, coordinated action is required to strengthen regulatory enforcement, improve healthcare access, implement antimicrobial stewardship, and invest in public health education. Without immediate intervention, Nigeria risks entering a post-antibiotic era where routine infections become life-threatening and modern medicine becomes increasingly ineffective.",

However, the misuse of antibiotics in livestock farming has raised serious concerns about antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a global health crisis threatening both human and animal health. Ethnoveterinary medicine remains widely practiced but lacks scientific validation and integration into conventional veterinary systems. This study assessed the demographic characteristics, antibiotic use, and ethnoveterinary practices among pig farmers in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Nigeria. A cross-sectional survey of 40 pig farmers was conducted using structured questionnaires, and data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square tests for association. Results showed that pig farming in FCT is male-dominated (67.5%), with most farmers (52.5%) aged 41-60\u00a0years and having only primary education (52.5%). Antibiotic use was widespread, 90% of farmers administered antibiotics, with oxytetracycline, penicillin, and amoxicillin being most commonly used. Self-administration was common (72.5%), and a significant association was found between antibiotic administration and frequency of use (\u03c7",

Local teams were assembled to conduct needs assessment analyses prior to implementation study design. The projects are ongoing, and preliminary results are presented using descriptive analysis. The BPRs chosen for each site were: hand hygiene in Lao PDR, antimicrobial stewardship in Nigeria, and trauma in Ethiopia. The World Health Organization (WHO) hand hygiene observation tool was used to determine baseline hand hygiene compliance in a children's hospital in Lao People Democratic Republic (PDR), revealing that 56.1% of hand hygiene opportunities were missed. A gap analysis was conducted in an academic Nigerian hospital to investigate antibiotic use in surgical patients, which found that 81.2% of antibiotic use was for prophylactic vs. empiric indications. Lastly, the emergency medical technician national curriculum as set by the Ethiopian Ministry of Health was reviewed by local experts and a 15-module supplemental curriculum was developed to include additional topics such as managing large-scale events, transport of emergency patients, advanced life support, and establishing quality standards. Through international collaboration spearheaded by local stakeholders, we initiated baseline needs assessments in 3 countries to identify pillars on which to build-up implementation projects based on BPRs.

Pet owners with high degree of control and empowerment to interact with veterinary professionals were more likely to do so. Veterinarians were capable of engaging pet owners in SDM; exploring owners' needs and feeding concerns was key. Pet owners trusted veterinarians' final antibiotic decisions and desired appropriate antibiotic prescriptions from them, alongside training and advice on how best to medicate their pets with antibiotics.

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a significant global health challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In Malawi, frequent stockouts of essential medicines and the widespread dispensing of antibiotics without prescriptions have exacerbated the AMR burden, highlighting the urgent need for robust antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) interventions. This study presents the first documented baseline assessment of AMS core elements across six public healthcare facilities within Malawi's AMR sentinel surveillance network. Understanding the baseline status of AMS implementation provides a critical reference point to guide future interventions, inform policy, and prioritize resources in the national response to AMR. This descriptive analysis used data from a national AMS program audit conducted from July 10-14, 2023, in six public hospitals: Malamulo Adventist Hospital, Mzimba South District Hospital, Kamuzu Central Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Zomba Central Hospital, and Mzuzu Central Hospital. The World Health Organization (WHO) Healthcare Facility AMS Assessment Tool was used to evaluate implementation across key AMS domains, including leadership, accountability, stewardship actions, education, monitoring, surveillance, and reporting. A total of 30 AMS committee members participated using a consensus-based approach. Of the six hospitals assessed, only one (Kamuzu Central Hospital) demonstrated strong implementation of AMS core elements, achieving a score of 79%. The remaining facilities reported moderate to low performance, with Mzimba District Hospital scoring the lowest (24%). Leadership commitment was inconsistent; only one (16.7%) hospital had fully integrated AMS into its annual plans, and resource allocation was limited. AMS ward rounds and antibiotic prescription audits were either absent or only partially implemented across most facilities. Education and training initiatives were fragmented, with only one (16.7%) hospital partially integrating AMS into staff induction. This situational analysis reveals critical gaps in AMS implementation across Malawi's national AMR surveillance hospitals. Limited leadership commitment, infrequent AMS ward rounds, and inconsistent education for healthcare workers were major barriers. Targeted interventions are needed to strengthen leadership, establish feasible facility-level AMS actions, and build sustainable capacity among healthcare workers.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of Antibiotic Stewardship Programmes in reducing antibiotic resistance and healthcare costs. However, the use of different methods to assess these costs, along with the uncertainty regarding which interventions are cost-effective, hampers the comparison of results and the formulation of clear recommendations. The aim of this systematic review was to provide a comprehensive overview of the available evidence on economic evaluations of Antibiotic Stewardship Programmes and to assess their impact on healthcare costs. The systematic review analysed articles indexed in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Reviews and Trials, Business Source Premier or EconLit that assessed the attributed economic impact of Antibiotic Stewardship Programme interventions in acute care settings and were published between 2015 and 2024. Studies identifying as economic analyses, cost-benefit analyses, cost-effectiveness analyses, cost-consequence analyses, cost analyses or cost-minimisation analyses and that fulfilled the essential parameters required for an economic analysis were included. A descriptive analysis was conducted to examine the impact of the interventions on overall costs, length of stay and antimicrobial costs. We also analysed the different kinds of interventions and the type of costs considered in the analyses. Study quality was evaluated using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist, version 2022. A total of 2965 publications were identified, of which 411 underwent full-text screening. The 27 studies ultimately included involved 20,232 patients in total and consistently demonstrated savings in antibiotic costs ranging from 2% to 95% relative cost savings, in length of stay costs (3% to 85%) and in overall hospital costs (3% to 86%). The intervention most frequently implemented was \"therapy evaluation, review and/or feedback\" (23/27, 85%), followed by \"alteration of therapy guidelines\" (8/27, 30%) and \"education\" (6/27, 22%). While operational costs were reported by all studies, implementation costs (8/27, 30%) and societal costs (3/27, 11%) were less frequently analysed. By CHEERS category, 9 (33%) of the included studies were rated as low-quality (<60%), 16 (59%) as medium-quality (60-80%) and 2 (7%) as high-quality (>80%). Our results emphasise that Antibiotic Stewardship Programmes may contribute to a substantial reduction in healthcare costs for a hospital. While the economic reporting in the field has recently improved, certain cost categories should be accounted for more consistently. There remains considerable potential for further improvement and standardisation to enhance the comparability of studies and facilitate the implementation of effective Antibiotic Stewardship Programmes.",

However, 40.9% of students demonstrated insufficient knowledge, and factors such as age, gender, and field of study significantly impacted KAP outcomes. Females had 65.8% higher odds of demonstrating a positive attitude toward AR prevention, compared to males, and 52% higher odds of adopting appropriate practices than males. The primary source of information on antibiotics was healthcare professionals, particularly doctors.

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial stewardship is a collaborative intervention strategy aimed at promoting the selection of optimal antimicrobial regimens to improve and measure the appropriate use of antimicrobials, thereby fostering rational use of these agents, enhancing patient outcomes effectively, and curbing the wide dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. Recently, nurses' pivotal contribution in multidisciplinary antimicrobial stewardship teams is increasingly recognized. However, the contexts and mechanisms able to facilitate nurses' participation in the complex dynamics of antimicrobial stewardship remain unclear. This review aims to identify and analyze the mechanisms, contextual factors, and outcomes that promote nurses' participation in antimicrobial stewardship interventions. This study adheres to the methods of realist review based on the Normalization Process Theory. Preliminary programme theories were generated through an extensive literature review and thematic analysis. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, CNKI, and Wangfang databases. The final Context-Mechanism-Outcome configurations were determined to validate the final programme theory. A total of 5635 articles were retrieved; ultimately, 35 studies were included for a comprehensive analysis. The review identified five key configurations clarifying the interactions among contextual factors, mechanisms, and outcomes: (1) Contextual factors: multidisciplinary team collaboration and hospital organizational support. (2) Strategies and mechanisms: articulating nurses' contributions and impact (Coherence-Building), promoting awareness and positive perceptions (Cognitive Participation), enhancing nurses' competencies (Collective Action), fostering collaborative and motivating frameworks, and emphasizing continuous quality improvement (Reflexive Monitoring). (3) Outcomes: improvements in patient outcomes (e.g., faster antibiotic initiation, shorter hospital stays, and lower mortality) and staff outcomes (e.g., enhanced knowledge, confidence, and adherence to antimicrobial stewardship practices). This realist review has developed a theoretical framework to promote nurses' participation in antimicrobial stewardship practices. This framework emphasizes the complex dynamic mechanisms that facilitate or hinder nurses' involvement in antimicrobial stewardship and aims to implement evidence-based strategies to encourage nurses' participation in antimicrobial stewardship practices. This, in turn, is expected to enhance the effectiveness of hospital antimicrobial stewardship initiatives and improve the quality of patient care within the hospital environment. This realist review highlights that, at both individual and organizational levels, supporting nurses' professional roles and responsibilities through targeted education, expanded prescribing authority, collaborative frameworks, and continuous quality improvement empowers nurses to integrate antimicrobial stewardship into their daily practice. By delineating the relevant mechanisms, contextual factors, and outcomes, the findings inform the design of complex interventions to sustain nurses' engagement in hospital antimicrobial stewardship programs, and advance the evolution of advanced nursing practice.",

Pediatric pharmacists are valuable and well-integrated within inpatient antibiotic stewardship programs (ASP) in children's hospitals. The Pediatric Pharmacy Association (PPA) believes all pharmacists, regardless of practice setting, should receive education to support entry-level stewardship activities in pediatric patients. Additionally, pediatric antibiotic stewardship pharmacist leaders should ideally be trained in both infectious diseases (ID) and pediatrics. Currently, specialized training in pediatric ID lacks standardization due to the paucity of subspecialized training opportunities. This paper provides recommendations to support pediatric ASP training, education, and pharmacist staffing for inpatient programs. Further, it is recommended to ensure protected time is available for daily and longitudinal pediatric ASP activities to support optimal care and prevent burnout. Finally, the PPA supports the evolving role of the pediatric pharmacist in the ambulatory ASP arena and recommends investigations into unique payment modalities.",

Use of MRSA nasal PCRs in the pediatric hospital was encouraged following an antimicrobial stewardship provider-led continuing education presentation. The primary outcome was duration of therapy of anti-MRSA antibiotics in days. Secondary outcomes included positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs) for all infections, pneumonia, and skin and soft tissue infections. A total of 319 patients were included in the study, 252 in the pre-intervention group and 67 in the post-intervention group. The duration of anti-MRSA antibiotic therapy in the pre-intervention group was 6.6 days compared with the post-intervention group at 2.0 days (p value = 0.027). Using data from 38 patients with concordant culture results for the infectious diagnosis, overall NPV was calculated as 92.1%. Skin and soft tissue infections and pneumonia were found to have NPVs of 90.1% (22 patients) and 100% (5 patients), respectively. Implementation of MRSA nasal PCRs in pediatric patients significantly reduced the duration of anti-MRSA antibiotic therapy, promoting their utility for antimicrobial stewardship.",

    "abstract": "Delay in the initial administration of antimicrobials is one of the strongest predictors for mortality for septic patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Given the different logistics among hospitals for antibiotic administration, this delay can take hours. As antibiotic administration involves care coordination and the participation of different team members, education and the antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) program play a key role in reducing these times. This study evaluated the time between the initial prescription and the effective administration of antibiotics for ICU patients in seven Latin American hospitals, before (pre-) and after (post-I and post-II) the implementation of a tailored educational approach. After establishing a baseline measurement (pre-), we implemented a tailored educational intervention directed to the ICU team including nurses, specialists, pharmacists, and the members of the AMS team. Then, we conducted a post-intervention measurement after a 3 month period (post-I) and repeated it after a 1 year period (post-II). During the pre-interventional phase, the hang time varied between 88 and 178 min, reporting an adherence to the 1 hour bundle of 33.8%. For the post-I, it significantly reduced with time variations between 46 and 104 min, showing an increase of 54.9% in adherence. After 1 year, in post-II, a persistent effect of shorter administration time was observed, varying between 49 and 109 min, increasing the adherence to 59.6%. Our results highlight that an active and tailored multidisciplinary AMS educational process incorporating antibiotic hang time protocols and including multidisciplinary healthcare teams involved in coordinating sepsis care decreases the administration time of antibiotics in Latin American hospitals with limited resources.",

    "abstract": "Using antibiotics without a prescription (non-prescription use) is common in the USA and contributes to antibiotic misuse, potentially harming individuals and threatening public health. At the individual level, safety issues related to non-prescription use include adverse drug reactions and disruption of healthy microbiomes. At the public health level, non-prescription use increases the risk of antimicrobial resistance. This qualitative study explored the reasons and motivations underlying non-prescription use among adult outpatients with varying healthcare coverage and education. We used purposive sampling to recruit participants who endorsed using non-prescription antibiotics in a larger quantitative survey. Participants were patients recruited from six public and two private clinics in Houston and Katy, Texas. All interviews were semistructured and conducted remotely by trained research coordinators in the participant's preferred language (English or Spanish). Interviews captured elements from two domains of the Kilbourne Theoretical Framework for Advancing Health Disparities Research, including patients' attitudes and beliefs, resources and various healthcare-system factors that could impact non-prescription use. Thematic analysis revealed the factors and situations that contribute to non-prescription use. Of 86 participants surveyed, 72% were female and 24% had Medicare or private insurance. Our thematic analyses on why participants use non-prescription antibiotics are organised into two domains: (1) patient beliefs and experiences and (2) healthcare system barriers. Patient beliefs and experiences revealed four themes: (1) belief that antibiotics relieve many symptoms/illnesses (eg, pain, sore throat, if symptoms/illnesses are persistent, lingering or severe), (2) belief that patients know their own bodies (eg, participants' perceived self-efficacy in knowing and using medications for their illnesses/symptoms), (3) belief that over-the-counter medicines do not work and (4) belief that antibiotics are like gold (eg, antibiotics are difficult to obtain, valuable and highly effective). Healthcare system barriers revealed two themes: (1) patients encounter obstacles to healthcare (eg, transportation, long wait times, high healthcare costs and lack of reliable telemedicine options) and (2) patients express convenience in using non-prescription antibiotics from multiple sources (eg, leftover prescriptions, social networks or purchased without a prescription).

    "abstract": "Excessive use of postoperative prophylactic antibiotics in children's hospitals is a significant public health concern, leading to increased risks of infections like  The OPerAtiC trial employed a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled design across nine hospitals to compare the effectiveness of two ASP-led strategies, specifically order set changes to align with antibiotic guidelines (baseline arm) and facilitation training (intervention arm). Facilitation workshops were informed by the i-PARIHS framework, emphasizing context analysis, evidence application, and recipient engagement; and were conducted remotely. Data were collected from 2019 to 2024, involving interviews with stewardship team members every two months. Data collected included proximal implementation outcomes of each ASP team member (acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness), intermediate outcomes (facilitation skill use) reported by the ASP team, and order set change completion rates. Proximal implementation outcomes for both strategies were rated high across all study phases, indicating strong baseline enthusiasm among participants (N = 30). Key facilitation skills-effective communication, conflict resolution, and data presentation-were pivotal for successful implementation. Most order set changes (76%) were completed post-facilitation, targeting various specialties and achieving reductions or eliminations in antibiotic use. Facilitation was associated with significantly more completed order sets targeting antibiotic reduction (p = 0.01), thereby increasing the appropriateness of antibiotic use. Facilitation is a valuable approach in refining ASP efforts, contributing to the successful reduction and de-implementation of unnecessary antibiotic use in children's hospitals. The study underscores the need for ongoing training and support for ASP teams to enhance their effectiveness in promoting appropriate antibiotic-prescribing practices. Future research should explore the long-term impacts of facilitation on antibiotic stewardship and patient outcomes.

    "abstract": "In healthcare settings, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is largely driven by excessive use of antibiotics. Empirical prescription largely remains common due to fragile healthcare systems characterized by lack of appropriate diagnostic services. Despite limited data on the epidemiology and the burden of AMR due to the scarcity of routine microbiology facilities, it is evident that Malawi shares a heavy burden of AMR. Effectively implemented antimicrobial stewardship programmes have demonstrated successes in minimizing inappropriate antibiotic usage, and curbing the burden of AMR. However, there are limited data on how antimicrobial stewardship teams can effectively deliver their roles in hospital settings in resource limited settings, including in Malawi. Malawi's Antimicrobial Resistance National Coordinating Centre (AMRCC) in collaboration with Clinical Research Education and Management Services (CREAMS) conducted participatory workshops with hospital-based antimicrobial stewardship committees aimed at establishing drivers of resistance and antibiotic overuse in hospitals from the perspective of the committees, and co-design facility-friendly intervention against AMR. The workshops consisted of participatory discussion, sorting and design thinking exercises, utilizing principles of implementation research. All the interviews were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed, revealing key drivers for antibiotic overuse and resistance in hospital settings. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis. Key drivers of AMR included limited antibiotic formulary access, poor cross-sectoral coordination challenges between healthcare, veterinary services, government agencies and private facilities, and culturally specific barriers. The participants recommended regular training for healthcare workers on AMR and infection prevention and control (IPC), widespread dissemination of AMR findings, public awareness, introducing electronic monitoring systems and the enforcement of antibiotic restriction policies as the best measures for improving rational antimicrobial use and controlling the spread of AMR. Our findings underscore the complexity of the drivers for antibiotic overuse and resistance in hospital settings, as well as the need for more participatory approaches in tackling the complex challenge of AMR. The findings also signify the importance of a bottom-up approach in designing a solution for promoting antimicrobial stewardship and controlling resistance in hospital and community settings. Participatory approaches blended with principles of implementation research will help to identify contextual challenges, and help to design solutions that are people-centred, context-specific and largely accepted by all involved stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) presents a significant global mortality burden which particularly affects the low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Enhancing diagnostics to identify drug-resistant infections and improving appropriate access to novel Reserve antibiotics in LMICs can address AMR-related morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. This article characterizes the AMR landscape across 14 LMICs and describes an introductory pathway for novel Reserve antibiotics. This mixed-method study was completed in 14 LMICs in Africa, the Americas, Asia and Europe through a combination of qualitative interviews with physicians and public health experts (PHEs), and a quantitative survey of physicians, supported by an assessment of secondary materials relating to antibiotic introduction and AMR burden. A total of 54 physicians and 17 PHEs were interviewed, and 209 physicians participated in the survey. Top unmet needs across public and private settings were as follows: access to new antibiotics to better manage drug-resistant infections; affordability; adequate safety profile for prescribed antibiotics. Access to diagnostics and antibiotic susceptibility testing was noted as a barrier, with large tertiary and private centres experiencing better access. Implementation of antibiotic stewardship programmes was variable and limited by insufficient funding, shortage of infectious disease physicians, poor AMR education and lack of restrictions to limit antibiotic use. Antibiotic access varies by sector, centre type, location and strength of individual state procurement systems. In particular, private sector facilities have better access to Reserve products. In most countries, most Reserve antibiotics included in WHO's Essential Medicines List (EML) were not included in national EMLs or not registered in countries. This study has helped to identify common barriers and pathways to Reserve antibiotic access, irrespective of the level of preparedness of countries. The data offer insights into possible solutions to improve access and highlight opportunities to strengthen access pathways and expedite access, for example, by identifying priority antibiotics based on national public health need. A six-step introductory pathway for novel Reserve antibiotics is described.",

This study aims to investigate the contribution of clinical pharmacy services in reducing antimicrobial drug therapy problems (ADTPs) in the intensive care unit. This study was a prospective, pre-post intervention study conducted over a total duration of 6\u00a0months (15 January 2023-15 July 2023) in T\u00fcrkiye. During both control period (CP) and intervention period (IP), ADTPs were identified and classified according to established definitions describing each day of therapy with a specific antimicrobial agent. In IP, clinical pharmacist-led services were implemented for the ICU team, encompassing problem-targeted educational sessions and bedside intervention recommendations. A total of 85 patients (CP, n = 43; IP, n = 42) were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 68.87\u00a0years (SD = 16.09). The most common indication for antimicrobial initiation was pneumonia (56.5%), while the most frequently used antimicrobial agent throughout the study was piperacillin-tazobactam (44.7%). It was found that 5.5% of patients across all periods received unnecessary, 2.2% inappropriate, and 92.3% sub-optimal antimicrobial therapy. During both CP and IP, almost all ATDPs were categorized under sub-optimal treatment problems related to medication dosage and/or administration regimens (93.94% vs. 88%). A statistically significant 62% reduction in total ADTPs was observed during IP compared to CP (total ADTPs, 66 vs. 25; p = 0.001). This study identified a high incidence of ADTPs in the ICU, with the majority classified as sub-optimal. The significant reduction in ADTPs observed between the periods with the provision of clinical pharmacy services highlights the effective role of clinical pharmacists in reducing ADTPs.",

    "abstract": "Rational prescribing optimizes medicine use, reduces costs, and improves patient outcomes. However, adherence to rational prescribing practices varies, particularly in low- and middle-income countries like Ghana, where healthcare systems differ across urban, peri-urban, and rural settings. This study assessed adherence to WHO/INRUD prescribing indicators in public hospitals and determined each hospital's Index of Rational Drug Prescribing (IRDP). A retrospective descriptive study was conducted in 25 public hospitals across rural, peri-urban, and urban settings in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. Data from 5091 patient encounters were analyzed to assess prescribing indicators, including the average number of medicines per encounter, generic prescribing, adherence to the Essential Medicines List (EML), antibiotic use, and injection prescribing. IRDP scores were calculated, and geographic comparisons were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), with  No hospital met the WHO target of <2 medicines per encounter (regional average: 3.63\u2009\u00b1\u20090.62). Generic prescribing averaged 72.26%, and EML adherence was 91.85%, with no hospital achieving 100%. Antibiotic prescribing exceeded the <30% target, averaging 60.84%. Injection use aligned best with WHO standards (average: 13.42%), with 22 of 25 hospitals meeting the <20% threshold. The regional IRDP was 3.67, with rural hospitals scoring lowest (3.63), followed by peri-urban (3.64) and urban hospitals (3.81). No significant geographic differences in IRDP scores were observed ( While injection use aligns with WHO standards, gaps remain in generic prescribing, antibiotic use, and EML adherence. Strengthening prescriber training, antimicrobial stewardship programs, and policy enforcement is essential to improving prescribing practices and patient outcomes in public hospitals in the Ashanti Region. Improving medicine prescribing practices in public hospitals: insights from the Ashanti Region, Ghana Doctors and other healthcare providers must prescribe medicines in a way that is safe, effective, and affordable for patients. This study looked at how well hospitals in Ghana\u2019s Ashanti Region follow international guidelines for good prescribing practices. Researchers collected data from 25 hospitals across rural, peri-urban, and urban areas, analyzing 5,091 patient records to assess key prescribing patterns. The study found that, on average, patients received more medicines per visit than recommended, and the use of generic medicines (cheaper, equally effective alternatives) was lower than ideal. While most hospitals prescribed medicines from the approved Essential Medicines List, none fully met the 100% target. A major concern was the high use of antibiotics\u2014double the recommended limit\u2014raising the risk of antibiotic resistance. However, the use of injectable medicines was mostly appropriate, meeting international standards. Overall, prescribing quality varied slightly between rural and urban hospitals, but the differences were not statistically significant. The study suggests that better training for prescribers, stricter policies, and improved access to essential medicines could help hospitals improve their prescribing practices, leading to better patient care.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes aim to enhance antibiotic prescription quality, reduce antibiotic use, and combat multi-drug-resistant pathogens. However, the optimal AMS intervention for different clinical settings remains unclear, with previous studies predominantly focusing on antibiotic consumption rather than prescription appropriateness. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of an education-based AMS intervention on antibiotic prescription appropriateness in three medical units of a 1500-bed university hospital. We conducted a retrospective interventional, interrupted time series study, to test the effect of an educational programme in three medical units of our 1500-bed university hospital in Rome, from June 2018 to October 2019. The intervention comprised six educational meetings held over 3 months (December 2018 to February 2019). The primary outcome was the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions, with in-hospital survival as a secondary outcome. Of 609 antibiotic prescriptions evaluated, the programme led to a significant and sustained reduction in inappropriate prescriptions in one unit (change in level: -18.15%, P<0.01; change in trend: -3.21%, P=0.01), while it failed to demonstrate a significant reduction in the other two units and globally in the three units. The same educational AMS programme led to variable results in terms of antibiotic appropriateness in three medical units with similar structural and organizational features. Larger and more tailored high-quality AMS interventional studies are needed to better understand the impact of educational programmes on the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the implications of Spain's recent legislative reform enabling nurses to prescribe antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women, positioning it as a critical development in antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) and nursing practice. The paper aims to assess how this policy aligns with international models of nurse prescribing, evaluating its potential to enhance workforce flexibility, and identifying some challenges and opportunities regarding its implementation. While this reform may reduce pressures on general practitioners and optimize primary care delivery, it raises questions regarding diagnostic accuracy, restricted formularies and the need for rigorous surveillance. The viewpoint highlights the importance of robust training in diagnostic and clinical reasoning, regular updates to antibiotic formularies and comprehensive auditing mechanisms to ensure safe and effective prescribing. Additionally, we explore broader considerations, such as professional incentives and inter-professional collaboration, essential for the sustained impact of nurse prescribing. By centring the discussion on nursing leadership in AMS, we highlight an underexplored area of policy implementation, with implications for other countries considering similar reforms.",

    "abstract": "Over-the-counter antibiotic sales in community-pharmacies significantly drive antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to inappropriate use and early treatment discontinuation. In Bangladesh, community pharmacies, which dispense 56.6\u00a0% of antibiotics without prescriptions, serve as the first health-seeking touchpoint, yet conventional stewardship strategies often overlook these informal providers, heightening AMR risks. This study examines drug-sellers' understanding and practices towards antibiotic dispensing and compares their symptomatic-treatment practices with Bangladesh's Standard Treatment Guidelines (STGs) to understand the extent of antibiotic misuse. A cross-sectional survey in two urban and two rural areas of Bangladesh involved 120 drug-sellers from 30 randomly selected pharmacies per site. Knowledge was compared between drug-sellers with pharmacy-dispensing training and those without training, and their suggested treatments for two simulated health-symptoms-upper respiratory-tract and gastrointestinal infections-were evaluated against STGs to determine the extent of misuse. Most drug-sellers were aged 41-50\u00a0years (35.0\u00a0%), with 39.2\u00a0% holding a bachelor's degree or higher, and 65.8\u00a0% having pharmacy-dispensing training. The overall knowledge score on antibiotic use and AMR was moderate at 60.2\u00a0% (5-7 out of 10), with 32.5\u00a0% scoring \u22644, indicating poor knowledge; trained drug-sellers scored significantly better ( This study highlights the need for context-specific policies and regulatory measures in informal healthcare settings. While improving drug-sellers' knowledge is vital for antimicrobial stewardship in LMICs like Bangladesh, it alone is insufficient due to market competition, weak regulation, and patient-driven demand. Thus, curbing inappropriate antibiotic use at the community level requires stronger enforcement and multifaceted, context-tailored interventions-including public awareness, targeted training, and market-responsive strategies.",

Southeast Asia has become a leading epicenter for the development and spread of carbapenem-resistant bacterial strains. Socioeconomic background, being a major health determinant, can heavily affect this rate of antibiotic resistance.\u00a0 Methods This retrospective study was conducted at a 1,700-bed tertiary care facility in Kolkata, India, between October 2023 and January 2024. A total of 248 culture results from urine, sputum, blood, wound, and ascitic fluid, which showed growth of Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) and coccobacilli (GNCB) during the study period, were analyzed. Medical records were reviewed to collect demographic and clinical data. The comparison was made between two population groups based on economic status, identified by ration cards as defined by the Government of West Bengal, India.\u00a0 Results This study assessed the prevalence and antibiotic resistance patterns of Gram-negative bacteria in clinical samples, focusing on urine, blood, sputum, wound, and ascitic fluid. The analysis revealed that GNB\u00a0were widely distributed across sample types, while GNCB\u00a0showed higher prevalence in blood and ascitic fluid. Antibiotic resistance was notably prevalent among GNB, with 49 (27.5%) resistant to imipenem and 50 (28.1%) to meropenem. GNCB exhibited lower resistance, with six (14.3%) resistant to imipenem, eight (19.0%) to meropenem, and seven (16.7%) to doripenem. A comparison of carbapenem resistance (CR) between higher and lower socioeconomic classes showed no statistically significant differences, with resistance rates of 15 (41.7%) and 96 (45.3%), respectively.

    "abstract": "The misuse of antibiotics has led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), particularly threatening critically ill patients reliant on these medications. This review explores the challenges of superbugs and AMR in critical care settings and highlights potential solutions. This narrative review used keywords like \"antimicrobial resistance\" and \"superbugs\" in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. The overuse and misprescription of antibiotics contribute to developing superbugs, rendering traditional treatments ineffective in critical care. AMR in critical care leads to increased costs, extended hospital stays, and limited treatment options. Combating AMR requires a multifaceted approach, including antibiotic stewardship, research, and development of novel antibiotics and alternative therapies, and rigorous infection control measures. Public education and collaboration among stakeholders are crucial for effective strategies. Future success hinges on a paradigm shift toward\u00a0antibiotic stewardship, innovation in antimicrobials, and infection control. Implementing legislation and antimicrobial\u00a0stewardship (AMS) programs are necessary steps. Research gaps exist in understanding environmental factors influencing AMR. New classes of antibiotics, faster diagnostics, and optimized drug combinations are future directions. Global collaboration in research, surveillance, and policy development is paramount. AMR poses a significant threat to critical care. This review emphasizes the need for a multifaceted approach to protect the effectiveness of critical care interventions.

    "abstract": "In some emergency departments (EDs), pharmacists review and follow-up on microbiological test results for recently discharged patients, intervening when empiric therapy is missing or inadequate to ensure appropriate antimicrobial use. Currently, this practice is not well described in Canada. Characterizing these ED pharmacist activities can help identify antimicrobial stewardship opportunities and allow for more tailored education and training. The primary objective of this study was to describe culture review and follow-up pharmacy practice in terms of antimicrobial stewardship interventions. Secondary objectives included describing the types of cultures being managed and the antimicrobials prescribed empirically and post-culture review. A retrospective chart review was conducted using pharmacist workload tracking documentation to identify patients with eligible cultures from six EDs in Alberta. Three hundred cultures were included in this study, and one hundred twenty-nine interventions (40.7% of all cultures reviewed) were performed by ED pharmacists. Initiation of therapy was the most common (33.3%), followed by tailoring therapy (21.7%). Urine cultures were predominant (55.7%), and the antibiotics most prescribed, empirically, and post-culture for urine, were cefixime (44%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (34%), respectively. Five patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria were treated with antibiotics. Five patients with skin and soft tissue infections were treated with dual oral antibiotics when culture and sensitivity results indicated monotherapy would have been sufficient. Eight extra days of cefixime therapy were prescribed due to unaccounted doses administered in the ED. This study highlights the critical role of ED pharmacists in culture review and follow-up activities and their contributions to antimicrobial stewardship. By characterizing culture review and follow-up practices, several opportunities for minimizing unnecessary antimicrobial use were identified. These findings will help inform the development of targeted education and training programs to help strengthen the stewardship capabilities of ED pharmacists and prescribers. R\u00e9SUM\u00e9: CONTEXTE: Dans certains services d\u2019urgence (SU), les pharmaciens examinent et suivent les r\u00e9sultats des tests microbiologiques pour les patients r\u00e9cemment lib\u00e9r\u00e9s, intervenant lorsque la th\u00e9rapie empirique est absente ou insuffisante pour assurer une utilisation appropri\u00e9e des antimicrobiens. Actuellement, cette pratique n\u2019est pas bien d\u00e9crite au Canada. La caract\u00e9risation de ces activit\u00e9s des pharmaciens en DE peut aider \u00e0 cerner les possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019intendance antimicrobienne et permettre une \u00e9ducation et une formation plus adapt\u00e9es. OBJECTIF: L\u2019objectif principal de cette \u00e9tude \u00e9tait de d\u00e9crire la pratique d\u2019examen des cultures et de suivi en pharmacie en termes d\u2019interventions de g\u00e9rance antimicrobienne. Les objectifs secondaires comprenaient la description des types de cultures \u00e0 g\u00e9rer et des antimicrobiens prescrits par l\u2019examen empirique et post-culture. M\u00e9THODES: Un examen r\u00e9trospectif des dossiers a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019aide de la documentation de suivi de la charge de travail du pharmacien afin d\u2019identifier les patients ayant des cultures admissibles provenant de six DE en Alberta. R\u00e9SULTATS: Trois cents cultures ont \u00e9t\u00e9 incluses dans cette \u00e9tude, et cent vingt-neuf interventions (40,7 % de toutes les cultures examin\u00e9es) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es par des pharmaciens ED. L\u2019initiation de la th\u00e9rapie \u00e9tait la plus fr\u00e9quente (33,3 %), suivie par l\u2019adaptation de la th\u00e9rapie (21,7 %). Les cultures urinaires \u00e9taient pr\u00e9dominantes (55,7 %), et les antibiotiques les plus prescrits, empiriquement et postculture pour l\u2019urine, \u00e9taient la c\u00e9fixime (44 %) et le trim\u00e9thoprime-sulfam\u00e9thoxazole (34 %), respectivement. Cinq patients pr\u00e9sentant une bact\u00e9riurie asymptomatique ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s par des antibiotiques. Cinq patients atteints d\u2019infections de la peau et des tissus mous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s avec deux antibiotiques oraux lorsque les r\u00e9sultats de culture et de sensibilit\u00e9 indiquaient que la monoth\u00e9rapie aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisante. Huit jours suppl\u00e9mentaires de c\u00e9fixime ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prescrits en raison de doses non comptabilis\u00e9es administr\u00e9es dans l\u2019ED. CONCLUSION: Cette \u00e9tude met en \u00e9vidence le r\u00f4le essentiel des pharmaciens de la DE dans les activit\u00e9s d\u2019examen et de suivi des cultures, ainsi que leur contribution \u00e0 l\u2019intendance des antimicrobiens. En caract\u00e9risant les pratiques d\u2019examen et de suivi des cultures, plusieurs possibilit\u00e9s de r\u00e9duire au minimum l\u2019utilisation inutile d\u2019antimicrobiens ont \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9es. Ces constatations aideront \u00e0 orienter l\u2019\u00e9laboration de programmes cibl\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9ducation et de formation pour aider \u00e0 renforcer les capacit\u00e9s d\u2019intendance des pharmaciens et des prescripteurs en DE.",

    "abstract": "Prescribing medication\u00a0is an essential part of clinical dentistry, particularly concerning the use of antibiotics for acute odontogenic infections, surgical prophylaxis, and care of medically compromised patients. Research on dental students' knowledge and perception of antimicrobial prophylaxis in dental practice is notably lacking in Nepal. This study aims to bridge that gap by assessing the level of understanding among Nepali dental students. An online, questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was carried out among dental students all over Nepal. A total of 288 dental students from Nepal took part in the study, comprising 189 undergraduate students, 62 interns, and 37 postgraduate students. A standard structured questionnaire that included 12 clinically relevant and three perception-based questions was distributed online. The results were analyzed via descriptive statistics. The mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD correct answers were 6.79\u2009\u00b1\u20092.26. More than three-fourths of the total students (288), i.e., 76.04% (219), answered more than half of the questions correctly. In the dosage and timing scenario, 76.3% of the students answered correctly wherein interns provided the most correct responses (91.0%). In deciding their knowledge of specific scenarios, 73.7% of the students knew when to prescribe correctly in four of five relevant scenarios, with postgraduates performing better (76.1%). Performance declined significantly when it involved evaluating scenarios deemed inappropriate for prophylaxis. Additionally, self-reported perceptions highlighted significant gaps in knowledge (38.6%) and confidence (40.9%). These deficiencies emphasize the strong need for further education, as acknowledged by two-thirds (65.4%) of the students. While most students demonstrated a basic understanding of antibiotic prophylaxis, significant shortcomings were noted, particularly in avoiding unnecessary prescriptions. To ensure appropriate prescribing practices and reduce antibiotic overuse, the integration of a standardized antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) curriculum in all dental institutions in Nepal is strongly recommended.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) presents a growing global health crisis, with significant implications for the management of chronic, hard-to-heal wounds. These wounds often serve as reservoirs for resistant pathogens, particularly when complicated by biofilms that impede healing and shield microbes from host defenses and antimicrobial therapies. In October 2024, a multidisciplinary panel of wound care experts from the United States and Australia convened to develop a consensus document aimed at guiding clinicians in the responsible management of microbial burden throughout wound care. This comprehensive guidance outlines the core physiological processes involved in wound healing, the role of microbial colonization and infection in healing delays, and the mechanisms by which resistance develops and spreads. It provides best practices for wound cleansing, debridement, and the appropriate use of systemic antibiotics, emphasizing that systemic agents should only be used when clinically indicated. The document also explores the use of topical antimicrobials and nonantibiotic alternatives, such as topical oxygen, nitric oxide, probiotics, and chelating agents, to help limit reliance on systemic therapies. A key theme throughout the consensus is the importance of antimicrobial stewardship. The panel calls for targeted therapy guided by culture data, limited treatment durations, and the incorporation of education for clinicians, patients, and caregivers to ensure effective and sustainable wound care practices. By integrating emerging technologies, personalized care approaches, and coordinated interdisciplinary collaboration, these recommendations aim to reduce complications, improve healing outcomes, and slow the spread of AMR in wound care settings. This consensus document serves as a practical, evidence-based guide to support clinicians in making informed decisions that balance infection control with the urgent need to preserve the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapies.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotics are essential to combating infections; however, misuse and overuse has contributed to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are a strategy to combat AMR and are mandatory in Canadian hospitals for accreditation. The Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program (CNISP) sought to capture a snapshot of ASP practices within the network of Canadian acute care hospitals. Objectives of the survey were to describe the status, practices, and process indicators of ASPs across acute care hospitals participating in CNISP. The survey explored the following items related to ASP programs: 1) program structure and leadership, 2) human, technical and financial resources allocated, 3) inventory of interventions carried and implemented, 4) tracking antimicrobial use; and 5) educational and promotional components. CNISP developed a 34-item survey in both English and French. The survey was administered to 109 participating CNISP hospitals from June to August 2024, responses were analyzed descriptively. Ninety-seven percent (106/109) of CNISP hospitals responded to the survey. Eighty-four percent (89/106) reported having a formal ASP in place at the time of the study. Ninety percent (80/89) of acute care hospitals with an ASP performed prospective audit and feedback for antibiotic agents and 85% (76/89) had formal surveillance of quantitative antimicrobial use. Additionally, just over 80% (74/89) provided education to their prescribers and other healthcare staff. CNISP acute care hospitals employ multiple key aspects of ASP including implementing interventions and monitoring/tracking antimicrobial use. There were acute care hospitals without an ASP, highlighting areas for investigation and improvement.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is a significant global health challenge, exacerbated by unnecessary antibiotic prescribing. Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are common reasons for antibiotic prescribing in primary care, despite most being viral or bacterial infections that are self-limiting. C-reactive protein (CRP) point-of-care tests (POCTs) are promising tools to support antibiotic stewardship by guiding the management of lower RTIs (LRTIs). The aim of this study was to develop best practice guidance for using CRP POCT in the management of LRTIs in primary care. Scoping review findings informed guidance statements, which were then evaluated through a three-round Delphi process with an expert panel via web-based questionnaires. Statements focused on intended use, detection of bacterial LRTIs, communication strategies, device features, performance and ease of use of CRP POCT. The panel of experts included 19 healthcare professionals across several specialties, including general practitioners, community pharmacists, hospital pharmacists and respiratory physicians. Panellists rated each guidance statement using a 5-point Likert scale, with acceptance, revision or rejection determined using predefined cut-off scores for medians and interquartile ranges. Statements were revised between rounds using the feedback provided by panellists. In the first round, 49 statements were evaluated; 16 were accepted, nine removed and 24 revised for the second round. Of the 24 statements evaluated in the second round, 17 were accepted and seven were revised. In the third round, consensus was reached on four of the seven statements presented, resulting in 37 final guidance statements. These statements covered key areas, including the appropriate use of CRP POCTs to guide antibiotic prescribing, CRP cut-off values, integration with clinical decision rules, device performance and operational considerations, training requirements and financial reimbursement. The panel emphasised the need for structured guidelines to align CRP POCT use with clinical context and highlighted its role in improving diagnostic confidence while supporting antibiotic stewardship. This study provides a set of best practice guidance statements to support the use of CRP POCT in the management of LRTIs in primary care. Dissemination and further research are required to assess their impact.",

In Zambia's primary healthcare (PHC) settings, data on ASPs and antibiotic utilisation were inadequate to guide improvements. As a first step, this study assessed antibiotic prescribing and ASP core elements among PHC first-level hospitals (FLHs) in Zambia. A point prevalence survey was conducted at the five FLHs in Lusaka using the Global-PPS Antibiotic use prevalence was 79.8% (146/183). A total of 220 antibiotic prescription encounters were recorded among inpatients, with ceftriaxone (J01DD04, Watch) being the most (50.0%) prescribed. Over 90.0% (202) of the antibiotic prescriptions targeted suspected community-acquired infections, but only 36.8% (81) were compliant with national treatment guidelines. ASP core element implementation was 36.0% (16.2/45), with only two hospitals achieving over 50.0%. The most deficient core elements were accountability, action, tracking, and reporting. ASP implementation in Zambia's FLHs providing PHC was sub-optimal, with high antibiotic prescribing rates, frequent use of broad-spectrum Watch group antibiotics, and low compliance with national treatment guidelines. As key ways forward, ASPs in Zambia's PHC require strengthening by adapting the WHO AWaRe recommendations and improving accountability, actions, tracking, and reporting antibiotic use to improve stewardship practice and reduce AMR.",

    "abstract": "The rise of antimicrobial resistance as leading infection-related cause of death will necessitate trans-sectoral efforts on a global level. While many antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) incentives target healthcare workers, addressing undergraduates offers new and hitherto neglected opportunities. We describe the pilot phase of a novel undergraduate elective (\"stewards for future\", SFF) for medical students at the Saarland University, Germany, between 2021 and 2023. We focused on knowledge and attitudes relevant to AMS. To allow for full immersion, we applied case-based learning, problem-based learning, and peer teaching in a small group teaching format spanning 15 hours, including AMS ward rounds. We obtained students' pre- and post-course self-assessment regarding AMS topics using 5-point Likert scales modified from the previously published ASSURE elective, as well as their subjective experience using the German short intrinsic motivation inventory. Over four terms, 23 undergraduate medical students from the clinical phase participated in the elective. Participants reported an increase in their ability to explain the concept of AMS (mean and standard deviation, pre 3.26\u00b10.94 vs. post 4.74\u00b10.44, p<0.0001), their confidence in choosing the appropriate antibiotic (pre 2.22\u00b10.78 vs. post 3.57\u00b10.58, p<0.0001), their ability to judge potential drug side effects (pre 2.09\u00b10.72 vs. post 3.43\u00b10.71, p<0.0001), their confidence in communicating with colleagues about antibiotics (pre 2.30\u00b10.86 vs. post 3.52\u00b10.83, p<0.0001), their understanding of diagnostics as an AMS tool (pre 4.22\u00b10.41 vs. post 4.91\u00b10.28, p<0.0001), and their ability to evaluate the roles of all AMS team members including their own (pre 2.52\u00b10.77 vs. post 4.13\u00b10.68, p<0.0001). Participants reported having enjoyed the course (4.6\u00b10.5), while they were moderately satisfied with their performance (3.8\u00b11.0). Pressure and anxiety levels were reported to be low (1.8\u00b10.9 and 2.0\u00b11.0 each). Student participants of the elective SFF reported increased competencies relevant to AMS, while enjoying the course format. Sustainability and scalability will ultimately depend on the implementation into the core curriculum. Antibiotikaresistenzen und damit einhergehende Infektionen sind mit einer sehr hohen Krankheits- und Sterblichkeitslast assoziiert und erfordern einen sektoren\u00fcbergreifenden, global ansetzenden Umgang. W\u00e4hrend in den letzten Jahren zahlreiche Antibiotic Stewardship (ABS) Ma\u00dfnahmen, beispielsweise als Kurse f\u00fcr \u00c4rzt:innen, initiiert wurden, sind Studierende bislang als Adressaten unterrepr\u00e4sentiert. In diesem Pilotprojekt wird die Konzeption und Einf\u00fchrung eines neuen Wahlpflichtfaches (\u201eStewards for Future\u201c, SFF) f\u00fcr Studierende an der Medizinischen Fakult\u00e4t der Universit\u00e4t des Saarlandes im Zeitraum 2021 bis 2023 beschrieben. Der Fokus des Lehrformates lag auf der Vermittlung ABS-relevanter Kompetenzen, bezogen auf Wissen und Haltung. Die dabei eingesetzten Lehrmethoden waren Fall-basiertes und Problem-orientiertes Lernen, Peer Teaching in Kleingruppen, sowie Visiten am Patientenbett. Das Wahlpflichtfach umfasste 15 Stunden. Zu Beginn und nach Abschluss des Wahlpflichtfaches erfolgte eine ABS-Themen bezogene Selbsteinsch\u00e4tzung mittels 5-Punkt-Likert-Skalen auf der Basis eines zuvor publizierten Fragebogens. Zudem wurde nach Abschluss das subjektive Erleben anhand des deutschsprachigen Kurzfragbogens zur intrinsischen Motivation erhoben. \u00dcber einen Zeitraum von vier Semestern nahmen insgesamt 23 Medizinstudierende des klinischen Abschnitts am Wahlpflichtfach teil. In der Selbsteinsch\u00e4tzung durch die Teilnehmenden konnte eine Zunahme von zu Beginn (vorher) bis nach Abschluss (nachher) des Wahlfachs f\u00fcr folgende Angaben festgestellt werden: ihre F\u00e4higkeit, die Grundlagen und Bedeutung von ABS zu erkl\u00e4ren (Mittelwert und Standardabweichung vorher 3,26\u00b10,94 vs. nachher 4,74\u00b10,44, p<0,0001); die Sicherheit in der Auswahl von Antibiotika (vorher 2,22\u00b10,78 vs. nachher 3,57\u00b10,58, p<0,0001); ihre F\u00e4higkeit, das Nebenwirkungspotential von spezifischen Antibiotika zu bewerten und in ihre Auswahl einflie\u00dfen zu lassen (vorher 2,09\u00b10,72 vs. nachher 3,43\u00b10,71, p<0,0001), ihre Sicherheit in der Kommunikation mit Kolleg:innen bez\u00fcglich Antibiotika (vorher 2,30\u00b10,86 vs. nachher 3,52\u00b10,83, p<0,0001), das Verst\u00e4ndnis der Bedeutung der Infektionsdiagnostik f\u00fcr den rationalen Einsatz von Antibiotika (vorher 4,22\u00b10,41 vs. nachher 4,91\u00b10,28, p<0,0001), und die F\u00e4higkeit, ihre Rolle als Steward im interprofessionellen Team einzuordnen und die Rollen der Anderen im Team zu kennen (vorher 2,52\u00b10,77 vs. nachher 4,13\u00b10,68, p<0,0001). Die Teilnehmenden gaben an, dass ihnen der Kurs Spa\u00df gemacht h\u00e4tte (4,6\u00b10,5), wobei sie moderat zufrieden mit ihrer eigenen Leistung waren (3,8\u00b11,0). Das Gef\u00fchl unter Druck oder angespannt zu sein, wurden als niedrig eingesch\u00e4tzt (1,8\u00b10,9 und 2,0\u00b11,0). Die Teilnehmenden des Wahlpflichtfachs SFF berichteten von angestiegenen Kompetenzen, die f\u00fcr ABS relevant sind, und hatten zugleich Spa\u00df am Lehrformat. Die Nachhaltigkeit und Skalierbarkeit des Projektes werden letztlich von der Implementation in das Curriculum abh\u00e4ngen.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an increasingly serious threat to human and animal health. Antimicrobial use (AMU) in horses is gathering research interest, although there remain significant evidence gaps. Currently, there is scant qualitative research into equine owners' use of antimicrobials, specifically antibiotics, hindering the design of evidence-based stewardship interventions and policies. To understand Welsh equine owners' views and behaviours relating to antimicrobial usage. Cross sectional survey and qualitative data collection and analysis. An online survey (n\u2009=\u2009319) and semi-structured interviews (n\u2009=\u200921) were conducted with Welsh equine owners. The survey examined participant knowledge of and relationship with their horse(s), sourcing of antibiotics, owner-vet interactions on antibiotic prescribing, antibiotic usage, and their understanding of AMR. Semi-structured in-depth interviews further explored horse owner perspectives, experiences, and decision-making relating to these areas, to add nuance and depth to quantitative data. Survey data were descriptively analysed, and interview data were coded and qualitatively analysed using a thematic approach. Welsh equine owners regarded their horses as members of the family (84.8%). Most sourced antibiotics from their vet (68.9%) with a minority (5.1%) never having done so or having used antibiotics left over (16.6%) and 13.6% would consider changing veterinary practice if they did not receive antibiotics when they requested them. Interview data suggest that antibiotic use was shaped by (i) key relationships of care (human-animal and owner-vet); (ii) competing priorities (treatment need versus ease of administration); and (iii) imperfect comprehension (education, information, AMU/AMR knowledge). Potential self-selection bias of respondents due to the voluntary nature of participation. This study highlights variations in the horse-owner relationship, conflicting priorities involved in horse ownership, and the quality of vet-client relationships which may influence treatment decision-making. It raises some concerns about the sourcing of antibiotics and variable understanding of AMR, with important implications for antimicrobial stewardship and educational priorities.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a persistent and escalating public health crisis, often overlooked despite its severe global impact. Unlike acute infectious diseases, AMR progresses silently but relentlessly, posing long-term threats to health systems worldwide. This review examines the historical evolution and current epidemiology of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), emphasizing the global and Korean burden of MDROs. While the development of new antibiotics remains limited, alternative therapies such as bacteriophage treatment have re-emerged as potential solutions. However, challenges in access to novel agents persist, particularly in Korea, due to regulatory, economic, and market-related barriers. To counter AMR, comprehensive strategies are essential. These include infection control, antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs), and the development and proper allocation of new drugs. The One Health approach must integrate human, animal, and environmental health perspectives. Notably, infectious disease specialists play a central role in this fight: leading ASPs, shaping policy, engaging in public education, supporting research, and coordinating multidisciplinary collaboration. The AMR pandemic is unlikely to subside without systemic reform, sustained investment, and international cooperation. Urgent efforts must be made to address this hidden but growing threat. Recognizing AMR as a true pandemic is the first step toward containing its spread and securing the efficacy of antibiotics for future generations.",

To determine if using a procalcitonin-guided algorithm may safely reduce duration of antibiotic therapy compared to standard of care in hospitalised children with suspected or confirmed infection. A pragmatic, multicentre, open-label, parallel two-arm, individually randomised controlled trial with internal pilot phase, qualitative study and health economic evaluations. Paediatric wards or paediatric intensive care units within children's hospitals ( Children aged between 72 hours and 18 years admitted to hospital and being treated with intravenous antibiotics for suspected or confirmed bacterial infection. Procalcitonin-guided algorithm versus usual standard care alone. Coprimary outcomes were duration of intravenous antibiotic use and a composite safety measure. Between 11 June 2018 and 12 October 2022, 1949 children were recruited: 977 to the procalcitonin group [427 female (43.7%), 550 male (56.3%)], and 972 to the usual care group [478 female (49.2%), 494 male (50.8%)]. Duration of intravenous antibiotics was not significantly different between the procalcitonin group (median 96.0 hours) and the usual care group (median 99.7 hours) [hazard ratio\u2005=\u20050.96 (0.87, 1.05)], and the procalcitonin-guided algorithm was non-inferior to usual care [risk difference\u2005=\u2005-0.81% (95% confidence interval upper bound 1.11%)]. At clinical review, a procalcitonin result was available for 81.8% of the time, which was considered as part of clinical decision-making 66.6% of the time, and the algorithm was adhered to 57.2% of the time. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per duration of intravenous antibiotics hour avoided from bootstrapped samples was \u00a3467.62 per intravenous antibiotic hour avoided. Cost analysis of complete cases was also higher in the procalcitonin arm for all age groups, and for children aged 5 years and over. The intervention is not cost-effective as it is more expensive with no significant improvement in intravenous antibiotic duration. Robust antimicrobial stewardship programmes were already implemented in the lead recruiting sites, and adherence to the algorithm was poor. Clinicians may be reluctant to adhere to biomarker-guided algorithms, due to unfamiliarity with interpreting the test result. In children hospitalised with confirmed or suspected bacterial infection, the addition of a procalcitonin-guided algorithm to usual care is non-inferior in terms of safety, but does not reduce duration of intravenous antibiotics, and is not cost-effective. In the presence of robust antimicrobial stewardship programmes to reduce antibiotic use, a procalcitonin-guided algorithm may offer little added value. Future trials must include an implementation framework to improve trial intervention fidelity, and repeated cycles of education and training to facilitate implementation of biomarker-guided algorithms into routine clinical care. This trial is registered as ISRCTN11369832. This award was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme (NIHR award ref: 15/188/42) and is published in full in  A daily task in hospitals is to assess whether sick children have an infection or not, and doctors need to decide whether to start, stop or change antibiotics. On one hand, giving antibiotics promptly saves lives, but on the other, giving antibiotics to people who do not need them leads to overuse of antibiotics resulting in antibiotics no longer working for infections, so-called antibiotic resistance. If we can reduce antibiotic use in hospitals, this would be an important step in combating the spread of hospital superbugs. Blood tests can be used to measure the body\u2019s response to infection. Most hospitals in the National Health Service use blood tests to monitor whether a person is responding to antibiotics. One example is C-reactive protein, but this test does not always tell you whether there is an infection there and if it is getting better, or whether the person is just unwell from another reason. A blood test measuring procalcitonin is better for diagnosing bacterial infections, and procalcitonin levels are quicker to decrease when a patient starts to improve and antibiotics start working, compared to C-reactive protein levels. However, procalcitonin tests are not routinely used for children in the National Health Service. The BATCH trial looked at whether the use of a procalcitonin test is safe and could help doctors decide whether to stop or change antibiotics (from intravenous to oral), both of which safely reduce antibiotic use (and help limit antibiotic resistance), compared to not using the test. The trial found that in children admitted to hospital with a bacterial infection, the addition of the procalcitonin test is safe to use but does not reduce how long intravenous antibiotics were given for. Doctors did not always use the procalcitonin result when making antibiotic decisions, and although parents were largely positive about participation in the trial, some had concerns about extra blood tests and clinicians stopping antibiotics too early. Future research should include education and training for doctors to ensure that the procalcitonin test forms part of routine care.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial use (AMU) by veterinarians is crucial for animal health management worldwide. Its extensive and improper use with insufficient monitoring has raised concerns about antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Veterinarians' opinions on antimicrobial agents and AMR are crucial in shaping their prescription practices. Understanding these opinions and practices is essential for mitigating the impact of AMR. Therefore, a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the antimicrobial prescription practices and antimicrobial knowledge of veterinarians in Palestine. Descriptive and statistical analyses were performed at a confidence interval of 95%. A survey targeting 358 veterinarians in Palestine received 104 responses (29.1%). The majority of respondents were male (92.3%) and aged 31-40 (47.1%) or under 30 (42.3%). Most practiced in Hebron (31.7%), while others practiced in Jenin (14.4%), Tulkarm (11.5%), and Nablus (11.5%). The practices mainly included mixed practices (48.1%), farm animals (26.0%), and small animals (13.5%). Training on antimicrobial agents was primarily in English (93.3%), lasting five years (91.3%), with 40.4% having multiple course emphases in nonclinical years and 46.2% in clinical years. Only 57.7% had no additional degrees, but 54.8% attended training courses or conferences. Most veterinarians (64.4%) felt that they did not overprescribe antimicrobial agents, although 41.3% used them in 41-60% of cases. Clinical signs were relied upon for prescriptions by 85.6%, but only 39.4% had access to laboratory facilities for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Most respondents (76.0%) acknowledged antimicrobial misuse, and 71.2% felt there was inadequate supervision of AMU. AMR was seen as a serious issue by 99.0%, with improper prescription habits cited as a major cause (81.7%). Recommendations to combat resistance included conducting sensitivity tests, enhancing veterinary oversight, promoting biosecurity, and enforcing stricter regulations on antimicrobial sales and use. This study provides valuable insights into the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of veterinarians in Palestine regarding AMU and AMR. The study underscored gaps in oversight, with many respondents feeling that there was inadequate supervision of AMU in veterinary practice. The findings highlight the need for enhanced training, stricter regulations, and improved monitoring to mitigate the risks of AMR effectively. By implementing these recommendations, it is possible to promote responsible AMU, safeguard public health, and ensure the continued effectiveness of antimicrobial agents for future generations. Addressing these challenges will require a concerted effort from all stakeholders to create a robust framework for antimicrobial stewardship in veterinary practice.",

The goal of this study is to assess the implementation of ASP in Utah NHs. A cross-sectional survey based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) 7 ASP core elements was sent to Utah NHs via REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). The response rate was 50% (n=49). Most facilities (96%) reported leadership support and at least one facility policy to improve their ASP, however, a quarter of respondents (22%) did not know who was accountable for the ASP and 33% of facilities did not have infectious disease experts. More than half (69%) of Utah facilities reported use of treatment protocols and algorithms to outline the minimum prescribing antibiotics criteria. Most Utah facilities reported leadership commitment to ASP. However, few facilities were partnered with a referral hospital, used the full range of reporting and monitoring tools, and many lacked patient education. This evaluation highlighted strengths and areas for improvement in the implementation of AS core elements in Utah NHs.",

    "abstract": "Indiscriminate use of veterinary antibiotics significantly contributes to the current antibiotic resistance in the world. The primary objective of this study was to explore the factors that could influence knowledge, attitudes and practices of antibiotic use in commercial layer farms. A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate antibiotic use patterns and their associated factors among layer chicken farmers in Tanzania. The study surveyed 205 farmers randomly selected from three regions: Unguja, Morogoro, and Dar es Salaam. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, while negative binomial and multiple linear regression models were employed to identify factors influencing antibiotic usage patterns. A widespread use of antibiotics was revealed, with 97.1% of farmers using antibiotics for treatment, prophylaxis and/or increasing egg productivity. The most commonly used antibiotics were oxytetracycline (63%), doxycline-tylosin combination (29.8%) and enrofloxacin (22.4%). Notably, 95.6% of farmers reported that they do not observe withdrawal periods. Assessment of farmers' knowledge, attitudes, and practices yielded mean scores of 55.5%, 69.1% and 50.9% respectively. Furthermore, older adults and individuals with primary education were more likely to have higher attitude scores. Geographic location and flock size are among other factors that are likely to influence knowledge and attitudes towards antibiotic use. Higher frequency of antibiotic use was significantly associated with young adults, medium-scale farm operators, and farmers in Morogoro region (compared to the other two regions). The frequency, knowledge, attitude and practices related to the use of antibiotics were affected by scale of production, location, age, and education. These findings provide insights into antibiotic stewardship among layer farmers that could suggest future multifaceted interventions to promote prudent use of antibiotics, hence mitigating risk of antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "The rising prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a critical global health challenge. Healthcare workers (HCWs) play a pivotal role in combating AMR by implementing effective preventive strategies and adhering to good practices. This study aimed to evaluate the global knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of HCWs towards AMR. A comprehensive search of PubMed/MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar was conducted for English-language articles published up to August 2024. Inclusion criteria were observational studies reporting KAP data among HCWs related to AMR. Study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist. Statistical analyses, including heterogeneity (I\u00b2 statistic, Cochran Q), were conducted using STATA version 14. Random-effects models were applied for pooled estimates, and subgroup analyses, meta-regression, and sensitivity analyses were performed. Publication bias was assessed via Egger's test and adjusted using the trim-and-fill method. Geographical distribution was analyzed with ArcGIS 10.3 software, and evidence certainty was evaluated using the GRADE framework. A meta-analysis of 108 studies involving 29,433 HCWs assessed their knowledge of AMR. Additionally, 51 studies with 13,660 HCWs evaluated attitudes, and 43 studies with 10,569 HCWs examined practices regarding AMR. The pooled proportion of HCWs with good knowledge of AMR was 56.5% (95% CI: 50.4-62.6%, I\u00b2 = 99.5%), with the highest prevalence in Europe (70.3%) and the lowest in the Western Pacific (45.9%). Positive attitudes towards AMR were reported in 60.4% (95% CI: 48.5-72.3%, I\u00b2 = 99.8%), with the highest prevalence in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (64.5%) and among those with less than five years of experience (77.8%). Good practices were observed in 48.5% (95% CI: 36.5-60.5%, I\u00b2 = 99.7%), with the highest adherence in Europe (56.6%) and the lowest in Africa (39.1%). Subgroup analysis revealed that younger HCWs (under 30 years) showed better KAP scores across all domains. The findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to enhance the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of HCWs regarding AMR. Priority should be given to designing and implementing robust training programs tailored to the specific needs of HCWs in resource-constrained settings. Strengthening AMR-related education and practice among HCWs is crucial for combating the global AMR crisis effectively.",

    "abstract": "Inappropriate and excessive use of antimicrobials contributes to the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). To address this, better tools are needed to improve antibiotic prescribing globally. This study evaluates a novel antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) tool - the AWaRe-based microbiology reporting format - developed by the Departments of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases at the Government Medical College, Trivandrum, Kerala state, India. This format incorporates the WHO AWaRe classification into bacterial culture susceptibility reports. The primary objective was to assess the effectiveness of this reporting format in encouraging physicians to choose access antibiotics. The secondary objective was to identify the most preferred microbiology reporting format for antimicrobial susceptibility reports. A cross-sectional study was conducted among registered modern-medicine practitioners (physicians) in Kerala via social media platforms using a Google form-based questionnaire over a two-month period. Responses were automatically recorded and analysed using descriptive statistical methods. The study included all physicians who gave informed consent, excluding those who declined to participate. The sample size was determined to be 138 based on a pilot study. A total of 228 physicians participated in the study, 137 (60.1%) of which were clinicians. Among the participants, 199 (87.2%) preferred the AWaRe-based reporting format over conventional formats for effective implementation of the Antimicrobial Stewardship Programme (AMSP). Using this AMS tool, 76.7% (n=56) of participants were successfully guided to choose appropriate access antibiotics. The study demonstrates that AWaRe-based susceptibility reporting formats can effectively nudge clinicians towards better antibiotic selection, supporting the successful implementation of AMSP (antibiotic stewardship programs). This format also serves as a continuous IEC (Information, Education and Communication) tool, helping clinicians familiarize themselves with WHO AWaRe classifications and encouraging the preferential selection of access-group antibiotics when appropriate.

In dieser Studie wird ein neuartiges Tool f\u00fcr den verantwortungsvollen Umgang mit Antibiotika (Antibiotic Stewardship, AMS) bewertet, das AWaRe-basierte mikrobiologische Berichtsformat, das von den Abteilungen f\u00fcr Mikrobiologie und Infektionskrankheiten am Govt Medical College, Trivandrum, entwickelt wurde. In diesem Format wird die AWaRe-Klassifizierung der WHO in die Berichte \u00fcber die Empfindlichkeit von Bakterienkulturen integriert. Das prim\u00e4re Ziel bestand darin, die Wirksamkeit dieses Berichtsformats zu bewerten, um \u00c4rzte zu ermutigen, geeignete Antibiotika auszuw\u00e4hlen. Das sekund\u00e4re Ziel bestand darin, das bevorzugte mikrobiologische Berichtsformat f\u00fcr Bericht zur antibiotischen Empfindlichkeit zu ermitteln. Es wurde eine Querschnittsstudie unter registrierten \u00c4rzten f\u00fcr moderne Medizin in Kerala \u00fcber Social-Media-Plattformen mit einem Google-basierten Fragebogen \u00fcber zwei Monate durchgef\u00fchrt. Die Antworten wurden automatisch aufgezeichnet und mit deskriptiven statistischen Methoden analysiert. In die Studie wurden alle \u00c4rzte f\u00fcr moderne Medizin einbezogen, die ihre Zustimmung gaben. Ausgeschlossen wurden diejenigen, die die Teilnahme ablehnten. Die Stichprobengr\u00f6\u00dfe wurde auf der Grundlage einer Pilotstudie auf 138 festgelegt. An der Studie nahmen 228 \u00c4rzte teil, von denen 137 (60,1%) Kliniker waren.

    "abstract": "Infections with multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens represent an enormous challenge for the healthcare system. By implementing the principles of Antibiotic Stewardship (ABS), the rational use of antibiotics is promoted to counteract the increasing development of resistance on the one hand and to ensure adequate treatment for patients on the other. An interdisciplinary ABS team has therefore been set up at the Bundeswehr Central Hospital and is available to medical staff every working day as part of a consultation and ward-rounds service. The work of the ABS team primarily serves to advise on the treatment, diagnosis and prevention of infectious diseases. It also intends to provide knowledge during the training of young medical officers in order to promote the rational use of antibiotics even outside the Bundeswehr Central Hospital. Since the implementation of the consultation and ward-rounds service, antibiotic consumption at the Bundeswehr Central Hospital has been reduced by 25%. In this context, the halving of carbapenem consumption is particularly noteworthy. Furthermore, the rising number of consultation requests shows an increasing need for the service and acts as a marker for ABS awareness. The reduction in antibiotic consumption is not solely due to the mentioned service, but is also the result of interdisciplinary ABS measures. Infektionen mit multiresistenten Erregern (MRE) stellen f\u00fcr das Gesundheitssystem eine enorme Herausforderung dar. Durch Implementierung der Prinzipien von Antibiotic Stewardship (ABS) wird der rationale Einsatz von Antibiotika gef\u00f6rdert, um einerseits einer zunehmenden Resistenzentwicklung entgegenzuwirken und andererseits f\u00fcr Patientinnen und Patienten eine ad\u00e4quate Therapie zu gew\u00e4hrleisten. Im Bundeswehrzentralkrankenhaus (BwZKrhs) wurde daher ein interdisziplin\u00e4res ABS-Team gegr\u00fcndet, das dem \u00e4rztlichen Personal im Rahmen eines Konsil- und Visitendienstes arbeitst\u00e4glich zur Verf\u00fcgung steht. Neben Empfehlungen zur Behandlung, Diagnostik und Pr\u00e4vention von Infektionskrankheiten dient die Arbeit des ABS-Teams auch dem Wissenstransfer, um den rationalen Einsatz von Antibiotika im Rahmen der Ausbildung junger Sanit\u00e4tsoffiziere perspektivisch auch au\u00dferhalb des BwZKrhs zu f\u00f6rdern. Seit der Implementierung des Visiten- und Konsildienstes konnte die Antibiotikaverbrauchsdichte des BwZKrhs um 25% reduziert werden. In diesem Zusammenhang ist insbesondere die Halbierung des Carbapenemverbrauchs hervorzuheben. Weiterhin zeigt die steigende Zahl der Konsilanforderungen einen zunehmenden Bedarf f\u00fcr die genannte Dienstleistung und dient ebenfalls als Marker f\u00fcr das Bewusstsein f\u00fcr ABS. Die Reduktion der Antibiotikaverbrauchsdichte ist dabei nicht allein auf den Visiten- und Konsildienst zur\u00fcckzuf\u00fchren, sondern das Resultat eines interdisziplin\u00e4ren ABS-Ma\u00dfnahmenpakets.",

However, the impact of antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs) on infection rates in oral surgery settings is not well established. This study explores the effect of implementing an ASP in an oral surgery clinic to reduce infection rates. A team comprising oral surgeons, pharmacists, and infection control specialists developed and implemented a targeted ASP focusing on patient education, prescribed guidelines, and infection prevention strategies. A retrospective review of patient records was conducted to evaluate infection rates in oral surgery procedures before and after the program's implementation. Preintervention infection rates for oral surgery procedures were 8.3% (45/540). After the implementation of the ASP, infection rates decreased to 3.7% (15/400), representing a significant reduction (P < .001). Compliance with the revised prescribing guidelines increased, and feedback from oral surgeons and patients was positive. The implementation of an ASP in an oral surgery setting significantly reduced infection rates. This model, based on evidence-based practices and tailored interventions, can be adapted to other oral surgery practices to enhance patient outcomes and reduce antibiotic overuse.",

We implemented a quality improvement (QI) initiative preceded by a formative phase to identify barriers and facilitators. The strategy included developing an antibiotic management program, establishing a data management and learning system, and fostering teamwork and effective communication. The intervention spanned 2 learning sessions, each with an action period, and was supported by coaching and QI training. Primary outcomes included DOT per 1000 hospital days and the access antibiotic group use percentage. We examined the implementation of change ideas and adherence to clinical pathways for process measures using mortality rates as a balancing measure. Run charts tracked follow-up outcomes, with control charts employed once sufficient data points were collected. We gathered data from 249 patients during the baseline period (BP) (Jan 2022 to June 2022) and from 588 patients during the implementation period (IP) (July 2022 to January 2023). The IP group included younger patients with higher rates of acute lower respiratory tract infections and more severe clinical conditions. Access antibiotic group consumption was 30.7% in BP and 37.9% in IP. Concerning antibiotic DOT, throughout time, we observed variable results with many points outside the control limits, with an average of 854 in BP and 1068 in IP. The QI initiative demonstrated that ASP implementation in pediatric hospitals was associated with antibiotic narrow-spectrum selection.",

However, existing AMS assessment tools lack contextual specificity for resource-limited settings, leading to limited applicability in Asia. This project aimed to identify relevant themes from current guidance documents to help develop a context-specific assessment tool that can be applied by healthcare facilities (HCFs) to improve local implementation.We performed a sequential approach of a scoping review to identify relevant assessment themes for Asia and an expert survey for getting feedback on the relevance of assessment stems developed from the scoping review. We reviewed English-language published documents discussing AMS implementation or assessment at HCFs globally and in Asia. Themes were derived through content analysis and classified following the predefined context dimensions to develop assessment stems, defined as containing one identified determinant that may influence implementation outcomes. The survey consisting of identified assessment stems was reviewed by 20 locally identified experts in Asia who rated the level of relevance of these stems in AMS implementation in the region.National leadership, training and technical support, and policy and guidance were the most commonly identified themes among 100 themes identified from 73 reviewed documents. From these themes, we developed 131 assessment stems for the expert survey. Of the 131 assessment stems, 117 (89%) were considered relevant for AMS implementation in Asia by at least 80% of respondents. These stems were included in the process of developing a global AMS assessment tool to support HCFs to improve their programmes.In conclusion, national leadership and support represent a distinct and important aspect affecting AMS implementation in HCFs in Asia.

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance, anticipated to cause 10\u00a0million deaths and cost $100.2 trillion by 2050, is particularly severe in West Africa. While bacteria naturally resist antibiotics over time, their misuse intensifies resistance. Given the rising trend of antibiotic misuse in Nigeria, especially among the youth, this study explores this misuse among Federal University of Technology Owerri (FUTO)undergraduates. Using a cross-sectional design, the study assessed FUTO undergraduate students' knowledge, misuse, patterns, and perception of prescription needs, and identified commonly misused antibiotics. We categorized faculties as health-based or non-health-based. From these categories, students were randomly chosen and surveyed using a semi-structured questionnaire that was based on established research. Out of 400 students surveyed, 60.0% (240 students) displayed inadequate knowledge (Fair) about antibiotic use and resistance, whereas 33.0% (132 students) demonstrated poor knowledge, and only a handful, 7% had good knowledge. More concerning, 67.0% (268 students) reported fair antibiotic usage practices, 26.5% had poor practice with only 6.5% had good practice. The most frequently misused antibiotics were Amoxcillin, Ampiclox, and Tetracycline, often for conditions like Typhoid, Cough, and Catarrh. A significant correlation (p\u2009<\u20090.037) was found between students' antibiotic knowledge and their usage practices. However, no statistically significant difference in knowledge and practices was observed between students from health and non-health-based faculties. Undergraduate students at FUTO exhibit both a knowledge gap and misuse patterns concerning antibiotics. Implementing educational interventions, like antimicrobial stewardship programs, is essential. Given these findings, especially in the West African context, the inclusion and education of undergraduate students remain crucial.",

    "abstract": "Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) has significantly impacted the field of infectious disease diagnostics, offering rapid and precise identification of bacterial and fungal pathogens. Unlike traditional culture methods, which may take days to yield results, multiplex PCR provides diagnostic insights within hours, enabling faster, targeted antimicrobial therapy and reducing the delay in treating critical infections like sepsis. The technique's high sensitivity and broad pathogen coverage make it ideal for both single and polymicrobial infections, improving outcomes across respiratory, bloodstream, and bacterial/fungal infections. However, multiplex PCR is not without challenges; initial high costs and the need for specialized training can limit its adoption, especially in low-resource settings. This review discusses the clinical advantages and limitations of multiplex PCR, highlighting its influence on diagnostic accuracy, antimicrobial stewardship, and the global fight against antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Furthermore, recent innovations in multiplex PCR, such as digital PCR and portable devices, are explored as potential tools for expanding access to rapid diagnostics worldwide.",

To date, there are no studies to evaluate antibiotic appropriateness in UTIs in Singapore. We assessed antibiotic appropriateness in uncomplicated UTIs (uUTIs) and identified factors influencing appropriate prescribing. An inappropriate prescription was defined as one involving an inaccurate uUTI diagnosis, not in line with the 2023 Ministry of Health Singapore Clinical Guideline on UTI,\u00a0or both. We conducted a retrospective observational study of uUTIs from January to June 2023, using Point Prevalence Survey methodology, at 7 primary care clinics in Singapore. Factors influencing appropriate prescribing were identified with bivariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression. Among 369 uUTIs, 53.4% had inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions. Amoxicillin/clavulanate was the most prescribed antibiotic (47.2%). Inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions were more likely if patients had an antibiotic drug allergy (OR 2.49, 95% CI [1.29-4.81], p\u2009=\u20090.006) or multiple complaints (OR 1.32, 95% CI [1.09-1.61], p\u2009=\u20090.005).

    "abstract": "Approximately 10% of patients have a documented penicillin \"allergy\"; however, up to 95% have subsequent negative testing. These patients may receive suboptimal antibiotics, leading to longer hospitalizations and higher costs, rates of resistant and nosocomial infections, and all-cause mortality. To mitigate these risks in children, we implemented an inpatient penicillin allergy delabeling protocol and integrated it into the electronic health record (EHR) through a mixed methods approach of clinical decision support (CDS).We describe our protocol implementation across three sequential phases: \"Pilot,\" \"Active Antimicrobial Stewardship Program (ASP),\" and \"Mixed CDS.\" We highlight several potential pitfalls that may have contributed to poor clinician adoption.Patients were risk-stratified as nonallergic, low-risk, or high-risk based on history. Process measures included: evaluation rate, oral challenge rate for low-risk, and allergy referral rate for high- or low-risk when oral challenge was deferred. The primary outcome measure was the penicillin allergy delabeling rate among low-risk or nonallergic. Balancing measures included the rate of epinephrine or antihistamine administrations.The pilot and ASP phases used clinician education and an order set, but were mostly manual processes. The mixed CDS phase introduced interruptive alerts, dynamic text in note templates, and patient list columns to guide clinicians, but little education was provided. The mixed CDS phase had the lowest evaluation rate compared with the pilot and active ASP phases (6.4 vs. 25 vs. 15%). However, when the evaluation was performed, the mixed CDS phase had the highest oral challenge rate (33 vs. 26 vs. 13%) and delabeling rate (43 vs. 33 vs. 27%). No adverse events occurred.CDS tools improve clinician decision-making and optimize patient care. However, relying on CDS for complex clinical evaluations can lead to failure when clinicians cannot find the tool or appreciate its importance. Person-to-person communication can be vital in establishing a process and educating intended users for successful CDS implementation.",

This observational study aimed to assess the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to FLUTD among Italian veterinarians and explore variations in different workplaces. Data were collected via an anonymous survey completed by 317 veterinarians from small clinics (SC), large clinics (LC), and veterinary hospitals (VH). Results revealed that approximately half of respondents relied on clinical signs and urinalysis for diagnosis, while fewer incorporated abdominal ultrasound. Urine culture and sensitivity (UCS) testing was infrequently performed, primarily due to financial and logistical constraints, with higher compliance in VH practitioners. Antimicrobials were widely employed, with enhanced penicillins being the most prescribed class. The frequent empirical use of quinolones raises concern regarding gaps in antimicrobial stewardship. Despite some adherence to the ISCAID guidelines, discrepancies in diagnostic rigor, antimicrobial selection, and treatment duration were observed. Larger facilities demonstrated greater alignment with evidence-based practices, emphasizing the need for widespread education on appropriate antimicrobial use. This study underscores the importance of integrating guideline-based diagnostics and stewardship in managing feline urinary tract diseases.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are essential for optimizing antimicrobial use, but many medium-sized hospitals lack infectious disease (ID) specialists. Ward pharmacists can contribute to ASPs, but the qualitative changes in their practice patterns after ASP implementation remains unclear. We aimed to explore the potential of text mining as a novel methodology to evaluate changes in ward pharmacist antimicrobial management practices after ASP implementation in a medium-sized hospital without ID physicians. We conducted a retrospective observational analysis of data documented in clinical records by ward pharmacists in a 313-bed community hospital from April 2014 to March 2022. The ASP team conducted weekly reviews of targeted patients, provided feedback to physicians, and shared recommendations with ward pharmacists who then collaborated to optimize antimicrobial therapy. Using Python-based text mining with standardized technical terms and compound word extraction, we performed morphological analysis, co-occurrence network analysis, and hierarchical clustering to evaluate documentation patterns before and after ASP implementation in April 2018. Co-occurrence relationships were assessed using Dice coefficients (threshold, \u2265\u20090.3), and communities were detected using the Louvain algorithm. Changes in documentation patterns were compared using Fisher's exact test. The analysis included 1,353 pre-ASP and 5,155 post-ASP clinical records containing antimicrobial-related terms, which increased from 3.12 to 7.81% of the total pharmacy records. New strong co-occurrence relationships emerged in the post-ASP period for several laboratory parameters (c-reactive protein, 0.646; estimated glomerular filtration rate, 0.594; and white blood cell count, 0.582). Network analysis revealed a shift from medication-focused communities (Medication Review, Prescription Verification, and Patient Education) to infection-focused communities (Infection Assessment, Microbiological Review, and Severe Infection Management). Although Antimicrobial Management was consistently used in both periods (odds ratio [OR]: 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.38-1.20), cross-tabulation analysis increased significantly in Laboratory Monitoring (OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.39-1.78) and Infection Assessment (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.85-2.36). This pilot application of text mining demonstrated potential as a novel methodology for objectively evaluating qualitative changes in clinical practice patterns following ASP implementation, successfully identifying shifts in pharmacists' documentation focus and providing a foundation for future multi-center validation studies across diverse healthcare settings.",

The specialty of ID pharmacy initially arose as a form of consultancy for complex antimicrobial use cases. The rising complexity of ID pharmacotherapy among other reasons necessitates the growth of roles for ID pharmacists outside of positions primarily in AS, which we refer to as ID consultant pharmacists. They may be part of inpatient consultation teams, transitions of care, outpatient ID, and/or pharmaceutical industry/drug development.

A binary logistic regression model was used to evaluate the association between the explanatory variables (socio-demographic characteristics, institutional and professional factors) and dependent variables (professional engagement in AMR PCSIs). To avoid many variables and unstable estimates and control possible confounders in the subsequent model, only variables that reached a p value less than 0.25 at binary analysis were used in the multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify factors independently associated with health professional and facility engagement level in AMR prevention and containment strategies.

Concerning health facility engagement in AMR PCSIs, about one-third (n=203; 32.0%) of professionals reported full engagement in the facilities. Nearly one-fourth of professionals (n=169; 26.7%) reported including AMR prevention and containment procedures in their facility's annual plan. The overall health professional and facility engagement in AMR PCSIs was 412 (65.0%). Having a history of sharp injury (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=1.88 (1.19, 2.97; p=0.007)), working in a general hospital (AOR=3.746 (2.657, 5.282; p=0.000)), having good knowledge on healthcare waste management (AOR=1.99 (1.225, 3.258; p=0.006)) and being from a facility that included AMR prevention and containment in the annual plan (AOR=3.796 (2.01, 7.180; p=0.000)) were positively and independently associated with the dependent variable (professional engagement in AMR PCSIs). However, a working experience of 6-10 years (AOR=0.6 (0.32, 0.96, p<0.05)), receiving infection prevention control training (AOR=1.47 (1.02, 2.13, p=0.041)) and lack of adequate knowledge on One Health approach (AOR=0.50 (0.32, 0.79; p=0.003)) were negatively associated with professional and facility engagement in AMR PCSIs. In the study area, professional and facility engagement in AMR PCSIs was low. Providing training on infection prevention and control, healthcare waste handling, One Health approach, antimicrobial stewardship for all and disseminating national strategic initiatives to all levels in the healthcare system are important. Researchers willing to work in similar areas must use mixed-method study designs to evaluate the engagement of all (human, animal and environmental) stakeholders toward AMR PCSIs.",

To develop and evaluate an online educational program supporting LATAM healthcare professionals (HCP)'s ability to use and generate RWE for effective antimicrobial agent use, aligned with AMS principles. Two 90-min webinars were developed by subject matter experts. Changes in knowledge, skills, confidence and attitudes were measured via paired PRE-and POST-intervention survey questions. Satisfaction, intent to change and remaining barriers were surveyed POST-intervention. McNemar and Wilcoxon Signed Rank statistical tests assessed differences in paired dichotomous and ordinal data, respectively. Unpaired data underwent descriptive analysis. Open-ended responses were subject to thematic content analysis (inductive reasoning approach). The analysis sample included 741 PRE-intervention survey completers (epidemiologists, infection control specialists, chemists, pharmacists, biologists, microbiologists, bacteriologists and other physicians), with 47 completing the full POST survey (33 following webinar 1, and 14 following webinar 2). A significant increase in the percent of completers who were confident of 'what constitutes RWE' was found PRE (31%) to POST (73%) intervention ( This education improved HCPs' confidence in knowing what constitutes RWE. Findings provide direction for future interventions aimed at enhancing access to and appropriate use of RWE to inform AMS in LATAM.",

    "abstract": "Ear, nose and throat (ENT) infections are often associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality. Antibiotic overuse and misuse for most ENT infections have been reported, caused by a lack of expertise or uncertainties to distinguish between infection types. This study sought to determine the level of appropriateness of antibiotics for ENT infections and its associated factors in ambulatory care in a teaching hospital in Ghana to guide future policies given rising resistance rates. A retrospective cross-sectional study design was undertaken to audit the quality of antibiotic use in Ho Teaching Hospital, a leading teaching hospital in Ghana, between January 2022 to December 2022. A checklist was designed to extract patient socio-demographic and clinical information from electronic medical records. The main study outcome was the appropriate choice of antibiotics principally in accordance to the Ghana standard treatment guidelines. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed on the data collected using STATA version 14. The electronic medical records of a total of 3,279 patients were extracted. The majority (57.88%, n\u2009=\u20091898) of patients were females, median (inter-quartile range) age was 25 [7-42] years. Ear infections were the commonest (66.24%, n\u2009=\u20092172) diagnosed ENT infection, followed by throat infections (15.74%, n\u2009=\u2009516). The most prescribed antibiotic was oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid together with a topical neomycin-steroid combination (28.00%, n\u2009=\u2009918), followed by amoxicillin-clavulanic acid alone (18.69%, n\u2009=\u2009613). The appropriate choice of antibiotic for all ENT infections in accordance with treatment guidelines was 60.11%. Inappropriate use of antibiotics was high when more than one antibiotic and World Health Organisation (WHO) 'Watch' group antibiotics were prescribed and ear infections compared to the nose and throat infections were treated. The appropriateness of antibiotic use for ENT infections in this hospital was suboptimal. It was predicted by the type of infection, the number of antibiotics prescribed and the WHO AWaRe group. Antimicrobial stewardship interventions such as clinical audit with feedback and clinician education must be enhanced to among other things identify antibiotic use gaps to help reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics for ENT infections.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the prevalence and outcomes of carbapenem de-escalation among hospitalized urinary tract infection (UTI) patients at Jordan University Hospital from January 2022 to March 2024. This retrospective study included adult patients who received carbapenems as empirical therapy and underwent urine culture testing. Patients who were discharged before culture results (n\u2009=\u200931) were excluded. The primary outcome was to assess the rate of effective de-escalation, which is the transition to a narrower-spectrum antibiotic without therapeutic failure. Secondary outcomes included the effect on successful de-escalation on patients' hospital length of stay, and the relationship between urine culture results and the success of de-escalation. When determining whether to de-escalate, factors such as clinical stability, and urine culture results and susceptibility were considered. Chi-square test assessed associations between culture results and de-escalation success. A total of 205 patients who received carbapenems as empirical therapy and underwent urine culture testing were included in the study. Out of these, 116 individuals (56.6%) had negative culture results, indicating no infection, while 89 individuals (43.4%) tested positive, confirming the presence of an infection. Among these patients, 95.6% (196 out of 205) required de-escalation of their treatment, whereas 4.4% did not. The prevalence of successful de-escalation was 40.3% (79 out of 196). The analysis revealed that successful de-escalation is much more likely in cases with urine cultures showing growth (86.8%) compared to those with no growth (17.2%) (p\u2009=\u20090.001). The study also indicated no significant differences in the length of hospital stay between the successfully de-escalated group and those who failed or were incorrectly de-escalated (P\u2009>\u20090.05). The study underscores the challenges of implementing effective antibiotic stewardship in UTI management, particularly regarding carbapenem de-escalation. Enhanced protocols and clinician education are essential to optimize de-escalation practices, especially in cases with negative microbiological results. Further research is needed to refine these strategies and address the growing issue of antibiotic resistance in UTIs.",

    "abstract": "China has established an extensive multidisciplinary surveillance network encompassing antimicrobial utilisation, antimicrobial resistance, and nosocomial infections. We aimed to identify challenges and barriers in antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) development based on this national multidisciplinary surveillance network. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 15 hospitals across China from July 2021 to April 2023. Purposeful sampling was employed to select the hospitals based on the rising prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. The survey consisted of three parts: a testing questionnaire was used to assess the awareness of clinical physicians regarding AMS; a scoring table was developed through the Delphi method to assess the hospitals' multidisciplinary management covering antibacterial usage surveillance, resistance surveillance, fungal surveillance, infectious disease management, and infection prevention and control; an on-site investigation based on case review and field inspection. Pearson correlation tests were used to examine the relationship between resistance levels and scores for various items. Theme analysis was applied to highlight key areas of focus in hospital multidisciplinary AMS from the on-site investigation. Findings revealed that physicians of respiratory, infectious disease, and critical care were the top 3 specialists in AMS awareness scores, with an average of 70 points, 65 points and 62.5 points, respectively (a full mark of 100 points). Performance in infectious disease management, antibacterial surveillance, and infection prevention and control showed a scoring rate over 70%, with relatively low scores in resistance surveillance (49.1%) and fungal surveillance (36.0%). No significant correlation was found between any single scoring item and the resistance levels of focused drug-resistance pathogens. Five key areas were identified for improving multidisciplinary AMS: organizational structure, staffing and training, drug formulary and prescription management, laboratory testing and quality control, and clinical sampling and data reporting. The prevalence of focused drug-resistance pathogens could not attribute to any single factor. The following AMS activities should emphasise the establishment of sophisticated communication and collaboration mechanisms within multidisciplinary teams. Approval for this study was granted by the Ethics Committee of Peking University (reference number IRB00001052-22100).",

    "abstract": "Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) represent a persistent challenge in healthcare, contributing to substantial morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising potential for improving HAIs prevention through advanced predictive capabilities. To evaluate the effectiveness, usability, and challenges of AI models in preventing, detecting, and managing HAIs. This integrative review synthesized findings from 42 studies, guided by the SPIDER framework for inclusion criteria. We assessed the quality of included studies by applying the TRIPOD checklist to individual predictive studies and the AMSTAR 2 tool for reviews. AI models demonstrated high predictive accuracy for the detection, surveillance, and prevention of multiple HAIs, with models for surgical site infections and urinary tract infections frequently achieving area-under-the-curve (AUC) scores exceeding 0.80, indicating strong reliability. Comparative data suggest that while both machine learning and deep learning approaches perform well, some deep learning models may offer slight advantages in complex data environments. Advanced algorithms, including neural networks, decision trees, and random forests, significantly improved detection rates when integrated with EHRs, enabling real-time surveillance and timely interventions. In resource-constrained settings, non-real-time AI models utilizing historical EHR data showed considerable scalability, facilitating broader implementation in infection surveillance and control. AI-supported surveillance systems outperformed traditional methods in accurately identifying infection rates and enhancing compliance with hand hygiene protocols. Furthermore, Explainable AI (XAI) frameworks and interpretability tools such as Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) values increased clinician trust and facilitated actionable insights. AI also played a pivotal role in antimicrobial stewardship by predicting the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms and guiding optimal antibiotic usage, thereby reducing reliance on second-line treatments. However, challenges including the need for comprehensive clinician training, high integration costs, and ensuring compatibility with existing workflows were identified as barriers to widespread adoption. The integration of AI in HAI prevention and management represents a potentially transformative shift in enhancing predictive capabilities and supporting effective infection control measures. Successful implementation necessitates standardized validation protocols, transparent data reporting, and the development of user-friendly interfaces to ensure seamless adoption by healthcare professionals. Variability in data sources and model validations across studies underscores the necessity for multicenter collaborations and external validations to ensure consistent performance across diverse healthcare environments. Innovations in non-real-time AI frameworks offer viable solutions for scaling AI applications in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), addressing the higher prevalence of HAIs in these regions. Artificial Intelligence stands as a transformative tool in the fight against hospital-acquired infections, offering advanced solutions for prevention, surveillance, and management. To fully realize its potential, the healthcare sector must prioritize rigorous validation standards, comprehensive data quality reporting, and the incorporation of interpretability tools to build clinician confidence. By adopting scalable AI models and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, healthcare systems can overcome existing barriers, integrating AI seamlessly into infection control policies and ultimately enhancing patient safety and care quality. Further research is needed to evaluate cost-effectiveness, real-world applications, and strategies (e.g., clinician training and the integration of explainable AI) to improve trust and broaden clinical adoption.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial misuse in surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP) can include the inappropriate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics or prolonged dosing. In 2021, a pilot antimicrobial stewardship programme (ASP) was launched in Georgia, which involved developing and adapting SAP guidelines, establishing an interprofessional SAP prescribing approach, collecting surgical site infection (SSI) data via routinely collected data and telephonic patient follow-ups, and providing surgical unit staff with prescribing feedback and training on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and antimicrobial stewardship (AMS). ASP introduction was staggered across ten hospitals over three years. This study explored behavioural determinants of surgical teams' ASP uptake in five hospitals where the ASP was introduced or about to be introduced. Findings primarily concerned epidemiologists' and nurses' ASP-related behaviour. Those at ASP non-introduced hospitals were less involved in the SAP prescribing process, had lower AMR awareness, and lacked professional development opportunities. Those at ASP-introduced hospitals exhibited higher AMR knowledge and felt ASP participation boosted confidence, facilitated work, and furnished key professional development. Results indicate interprofessional collaboration on SAP prescribing supported ASP uptake across teams, and investment in health worker training and administrative encouragement ensured effective ASP participation and implementation. Findings highlight the crucial role of epidemiologists in SAP and illustrate a need for developing Georgian nurses' AMR competencies as a vehicle to address public AMR knowledge gaps. Longer-term ASP uptake will need to consider the regulatory context in which hospitals lack access to national-level SSI data and feedback on SSI reporting but are fined for reporting non-compliance. Despite resource limitations and a small sample size, the study engaged all pilot ASP health workers.

    "abstract": "Adherence to antimicrobial recommendations varies and is influenced by client-veterinarian communication, making adequate training related to communication and antimicrobial stewardship, especially important for veterinary students. Prior research suggests that veterinary medical students underestimate clients' antimicrobial knowledge and adherence to instructions, as well as veterinarians' communication competence. These perceptions could impact future interactions with clients, including recommendations for treatment. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore students' perceptions of client knowledge and adherence. Eleven focus groups were conducted with 33 veterinary students across all years of the curriculum to learn more about their perceptions of the efficacy of veterinary communication related to antibiotics and client adherence to instructions for antibiotic use. Results from this research show that students acknowledge the importance of communication to adherence, and this is especially important when engaging clients in discussion of antibiotics. More specifically, analysis of the transcripts revealed five main themes: the importance of client education and health literacy, navigating client expectations, barriers and enablers to client adherence, navigating generational differences among colleagues and clients, and the importance and impact of role modeling in the clinical setting. Results of this research have implications for training the next generation of veterinarians to confidently communicate about antibiotics, enhance client adherence, and increase the likelihood of positive patient outcomes.",

This study assesses antibiotic use patterns and resistance in tertiary care hospitals across India to inform AMR interventions. This cross-sectional survey was conducted over two weeks between May and August 2023 in eight Indian tertiary care hospitals. The survey comprised two parts: the ward form, which captured ward details (name, specialty, bed count, and antibiotic use), and the patient form, which documented demographics, antimicrobial therapy, and microbiological data, including redundant coverage and designated antibiotics. Rationality was assessed using 50 forms from each site. Data were collected digitally by trained team of surveyors. The study included hospitalized patients on systemic antimicrobials, excluding outpatient, day-care dialysis patients, and those on topical antibiotics. Among 3974 patients in eight hospitals, adult surgical and pediatric medical wards had the highest antibiotic usage. Of 4248 prescriptions, the most common antibiotics were ceftriaxone (14.9%, 95% CI: 10.4%, 18.4%), metronidazole (10.2%, 95% CI: 6.0%-11.2%), amikacin (8.7%, 95% CI: 6.3%-11.3%), piperacillin/tazobactam (8.7%, 95% CI: 9.1%-10.5%), and meropenem (7.1%, 95% CI: 5.2%-9.5%). Antibiotics were categorized as 'Watch' (57.03%), 'Access' (32.67%), and 'Reserve' (5.08%). Primary indications were community-acquired infections (30.6%, 95% CI: 25.1%-32.5%) and surgical prophylaxis (31%, 95% CI: 29.8%-36.9%).

    "abstract": "The use and misuse of antibiotics for treating animal and human infections are a key driver of the emergence of resistant bacterial strains at the human-animal-environment interface. This inappropriate use threatens ecological balance and poses a significant risk to human health. The lack of relevant knowledge of the right attitudes and practices regarding antimicrobial stewardship among fish farmers, antibiotic drug retailers, and government agencies has significantly exacerbated this serious environmental and public health issue. To enhance understanding and improve communication for the implementation of sound antimicrobial stewardship in the fish farming industry in Ghana, this study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practices of key stakeholders regarding the use of antibiotics in cage aquaculture on Volta Lake in Ghana. We conducted a qualitative field survey involving interviews, key informant discussions, and observations. The participants were veterinary drug retailers and government officials from the fisheries, aquaculture, and veterinary sectors to gather insights about their knowledge, attitudes, and practices on antibiotics use in aquaculture. The study covered 40 respondents, comprising 18 veterinary drug retailers, 12 general pharmaceutical shop operators, five Fisheries Commission officials, and five government-trained veterinary personnel operating along the stratum II of the Volta Lake of Ghana. All quantitative and qualitative data were analysed using STATA and thematic analysis. The survey revealed that drug retailers possess limited knowledge, expertise, and education on the use of antibiotics in fish farming. It was found that drug sellers occasionally recommend treatment regimens to fish farmers based on observable symptoms associated with specific diseases. The results further revealed a lack of regulation in selling veterinary drugs to farmers. Government officials, on their part, strive to create awareness and educate farmers on the selection and appropriate use of antibiotics through routine quarterly inspections, thereby promoting best practices for cultivating healthy fish. Despite this, the results indicate insufficient coordination between government officials, drug retailers, and fish farmers regarding the usage of antibiotics in aquaculture on Lake Volta. Regular joint training programs are encouraged to improve and enhance knowledge, attitudes, and practices among government officials, veterinary drug retailers, and fish farmers. In addition, monitoring the activities of drug sellers and users, as well as fostering effective communication among all stakeholders, will significantly aid in reducing antibiotic use, misuse, and abuse in aquaculture. Under the One Health framework, efforts to integrate veterinary drug retailers, farmers, and other stakeholders of concern in antibiotic governance are required to address the increasing burden of antibiotic misuse and abuse in aquaculture in Ghana and the world.",

To evaluate whether computerized provider order entry (CPOE) prompts presenting patient-specific and pathogen-specific MDRO infection risk estimates could reduce empiric extended-spectrum antibiotics for noncritically ill patients admitted with SSTI. This cluster randomized clinical trial included 92 hospitals and assessed the effect of an antibiotic stewardship bundle that included CPOE prompts vs routine stewardship on antibiotic selection during the first 3 hospital days (empiric period) in noncritically ill adults hospitalized with SSTI. The trial population included adults 18 years and older treated with empiric antibiotics for SSTI in non-intensive care unit (ICU) settings. Data were collected from January 2019 to December 2023. CPOE prompts recommending standard-spectrum antibiotics in patients prescribed extended-spectrum antibiotics during the empiric period when absolute risk of MDRO SSTI was estimated to be less than 10%, coupled with feedback and education. The primary outcome was empiric extended-spectrum antibiotic days of therapy (summed number of different extended-spectrum antibiotics targeting Pseudomonas and/or MDR gram-negative bacteria received per patient each calendar day). The secondary outcome was antipseudomonal days of therapy. Safety outcomes included days to ICU transfer and hospital length of stay. Outcomes compared differences between baseline and intervention periods across strategies. Among 118\u202f562 patients admitted with SSTI at 92 hospitals, 67\u202f033 (56.7%) were male and the mean (SD) age was 58.0 (17.5) years. A total of 57\u202f837 patients were included in the baseline period and 60\u202f725 in the intervention period. Receipt of any empiric extended-spectrum antibiotic during the baseline and intervention periods was 57.0% (16\u202f855 of 29\u202f595) and 56.0% (17\u202f534 of 31\u202f337), respectively, for the routine stewardship group compared with 55.4% (15\u202f650 of 28\u202f242) and 43.0% (12\u202f647 of 29\u202f388), respectively, for the CPOE group. Empiric extended-spectrum days of therapy per 1000 empiric days targeting Pseudomonas and/or MDR gram-negative pathogens was 511.5 during the baseline period and 488.7 during the intervention period in the routine stewardship group and was 496.2 and 359.1, respectively, in the CPOE bundle group (rate ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.67-0.79; P\u2009<\u2009.001).

This problem has raised the global concern of a possible pandemic, as the treatment of infections in both humans and animals is becoming more difficult. This study aimed to understand the opinions of practising veterinarians on the factors responsible for increasing antibiotic resistance among animals in Nigeria. A cross-sectional study of veterinarians from 36 states (including the Federal capital territory) was conducted using a paper-based structured questionnaire survey. The questionnaire was made available to the 1,117 veterinarians who attended 2023 Nigerian Veterinary Medical Association (NVMA). A simple random selection was used to select 295 veterinarians as respondents. The data collected were coded and stored electronically in a Microsoft Excel database and anonymised for further analysis. Statistical analyses were conducted using Excel and SPSS Statistics v24.0. Most veterinarians (89.8%) agreed that the antibiogram test (AST) is important before prescription; however, only a few (4.4%) request for an antibiogram before prescriptions to clients due to the unaffordability of the test by clients (x\u0304=3.21), the desire for rapid results (x\u0304=3.06), and the lack of diagnostic laboratories nearby (x\u0304=2.96). As a result, 61.5% reported that clients had complained that antibiotics prescribed did not work (curative). In addition, veterinarians opined that irrational antibiotic use among animal owners (x\u0304=4.34), an increased number of quackery (x\u0304=4.10) and ease of access of the public to antibiotics at veterinary pharmacies/shops (x\u0304=3.86) were the leading causes of increasing antimicrobial resistance in Nigeria. The significant factors responsible for veterinarians' opinions were education (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.929) and the value of conducting an antibiogram before prescription (\u03b2\u2009=\u20091.618) at the p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05 level of significance. This study revealed that irrational antibiotic use among animal owners, an increasing number of quackery and ease of access of the public to antibiotics at veterinary pharmacies/shops were the leading causes of increasing animal antimicrobial resistance in Nigeria. Therefore, this study suggests the development and implementation of policies and frameworks that promote antimicrobial stewardship and the establishment of veterinary laboratories in various communities in the country. Continuous education for veterinarians and livestock workers, especially on AMR, is also critical.",

Comprehensive literature searches were conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science using PICOS criteria. Studies involving adults with CAP exposed to ASPs were included. Data on clinical, economic, diagnostic, and treatment outcomes were extracted. Random-effects meta-analysis using R software pooled effect sizes. Outcomes reported in at least three studies were analyzed for robustness. ASPs did not significantly impact in-hospital mortality, length of stay, 30-day readmissions, sample collection rates, or intravenous antibiotic duration. However, notable improvements included shorter time to clinical stability and a 31% reduction in 30-day mortality. Legionella urinary antigen testing frequency increased nearly threefold, and the time from admission to antibiotic initiation was reduced. Enhanced adherence to timely antibiotic administration and recommended regimens was observed, though outcome variability persisted. ASPs significantly improve CAP management by enhancing clinical stability and accelerating antibiotic initiation. Multifaceted strategies, including rapid diagnostics and clinician education, yield clinical benefits. However, outcome variability suggests a need for tailored interventions. Future research should isolate specific ASP components influencing prescriber behavior. Ongoing investment in education, diagnostics, and interdisciplinary collaboration is vital to optimize CAP treatment and combat antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "Hospitals in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) face context-specific challenges in implementing antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes. The Global Point Prevalence Survey (Global-PPS) project has established a network of hospitals across 90 countries, using point prevalence surveys to monitor antimicrobial use and guide AMS activities. However, little is known about AMS implementation in these hospitals. Using qualitative research, we aim to explore the implementation process in LMIC hospitals within the Global-PPS network and the factors influencing it, identify potential implementation strategies, and evaluate the role of Global-PPS in this process. A qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured online interviews with healthcare workers (HCWs) involved in AMS in LMIC hospitals within the Global-PPS network. Participants were selected using a combination of convenience and purposive sampling and included clinicians, microbiologists, pharmacists, and nurses. Interviews followed a topic guide based on the integrated checklist of determinants of practice (TICD Checklist). Transcripts were analysed using a combination of inductive and deductive thematic analyses. Twenty-two HCWs from 16 countries were interviewed. Hospitals were in different stages of the AMS implementation process at the time of the study, from pre-implementation to institutionalisation of AMS as part of the continuous quality improvement process. While the Global-PPS provided a valuable tool for education and implementation, contextual barriers often hindered the translation of findings into targeted interventions. Four themes influenced AMS implementation, \"institutional support and resource allocation\", \"AMS team functioning, roles, and expertise\", \"adoption and integration of AMS recommendations\", and \"data-driven decision-making\" as a cross-cutting theme. Key determinants included AMS team competencies, multidisciplinary teams, sustainable funding and leadership support, diagnostic capacity, and reliable data to inform interventions. We also identified various strategies employed by local AMS teams to enhance implementation. This study examines AMS implementation in LMIC hospitals in the Global-PPS network and identifies key determinants. AMS teams address challenges through task shifting, local engagement and ownership. While empirical evidence on the effectiveness of these strategies is limited, these insights can guide future AMS interventions and studies within LMIC hospitals. Strengthening AMS requires bridging the gap between measurement and action and expanding research on behaviour change.",

    "abstract": "Non-judicious use of antibiotics by health professionals has been identified as an area for interventions and improvement by the World Health Organization for controlling antimicrobial resistance. Following the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines, we established an antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) program at the 950-bedded multispecialty private sector hospital located in western Maharashtra by the end of the year 2021. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of an AMS program intervention on the utilization of antibiotics and resistance patterns of organisms isolated from the patients. A significant reduction in the utilization of ceftriaxone (23.3 to 6.75), piperacillin-tazobactam (7.7 to 6.0), amikacin (9.03 to 5.15), clindamycin (6.25 to 5.75), linezolid (5.8 to 4.8), and ceftazidime (0.9 to 0.2) in defined daily doses (DDD/100 bed days) was seen after intervention. Antibiotic resistance decreased in gentamicin, amikacin, and teicoplanin. Overall antibiotic consumption reduced from 1,681.0 to 1,420.0 DDD/100 days. Culture-based therapy increased from 61% to 90%. Surgical prophylaxis compliance increased from 58% to 96%. The constant perseverance of the AMS team of our hospital had a positive impact on reducing the overall consumption of antibiotics. Stringent infection prevention and control practices, timely provision of treatment guidelines, frequent interactions and discussions with treating doctors, audits by clinical pharmacists, and feedback to the doctors along with various training programs and sensitization sessions by the AMS team have brought significant behavioral changes among the treating physicians.",

    "abstract": "The increasing threat of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) organisms highlights the need for effective antimicrobial stewardship in veterinary medicine. This study evaluated how veterinarians treating companion animals utilize antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) reports and antimicrobial use guidelines and their impact on antimicrobial selection. An online survey was distributed to veterinarians across the US, collecting data on demographics, clinical case management, AST report preferences, and perceptions of AMR, diagnostic stewardship, and antimicrobial stewardship. A total of 216 veterinarians participated. Results indicated a preference (83% to 89%) for AST reports with interpretative comments on antimicrobial selection and dosing. Most respondents (55% to 62%) preferred selective reporting over cascade reporting (25% to 30%). Clinical cases revealed the frequent selection of systemic antimicrobial therapy, with many respondents indicating the need for therapeutic consultation. Two identical cases with different AST report styles (full vs cascade) showed a 26% increase in good antimicrobial stewardship with the cascade report. Gaps in knowledge regarding AST principles were identified, with many respondents misunderstanding the establishment of breakpoints, AST and topical therapy, and the interpretation of MICs. These findings suggest that while veterinarians prefer full or selective AST reports, their antimicrobial choices align more closely with guidelines when cascade reports are used. This indicates that the AST report style may influence the antimicrobial stewardship practices of veterinarians and warrants further investigation. This study demonstrates the need for improved AST reporting and education on AST interpretation and antimicrobial selection to support antimicrobial stewardship in veterinary medicine.",

    "abstract": "Several studies highlighted a lack of knowledge of dentists concerning antibiotic stewardship. The objectives of this study were to evaluate dental students' level of knowledge in infectiology and antibiotic stewardship, and to identify factors associated with a high level of knowledge. A cross-sectional national multicentre survey was conducted in 2022-2023 through a self-administered and internet-based questionnaire. A knowledge score (out of 34) was calculated for each included student based on their questionnaire results. Hierarchical clustering methods were used to identify clusters of students according to their knowledge score. This approach highlighted distinct score levels. A logistic regression model was then applied to associate specific factors with these levels. The association between the cluster of students with the highest knowledge and the characteristics of the students and their faculties was assessed using logistic regressions. A total of 415 students were included. Two clusters were identified: the cluster 'average level of knowledge' included 290 (70%) students (median knowledge score: 26/34, IQR: 24; 27), while the cluster 'high level of knowledge' grouped 125 (30%) students (median knowledge score: 30/34, IQR: 29; 32). Mandatory courses and multiple learning modalities were associated with higher knowledge. French dental students seem to have a high knowledge in infectiology and antibiotic stewardship, as evidenced by the median knowledge score of each cluster, which are objectively high compared to the maximum of 34. We identified several factors associated with a higher knowledge that might help conceive learning modalities standardised recommendations.",

A cross-sectional study was conducted in 158 hospitals of Lao PDR, surveying hospital pharmacists involved in patient care from January to March 2022. The number of pharmacists providing clinical pharmacy and their practice frequency were assessed. Differences across pharmacist characteristics, hospitals, and areas were examined. One hundred thirty-nine hospital pharmacists completed the questionnaire, a response rate of 87.9%. The number of hospital pharmacists per 100,000 population was highest in Xaisomboun and lowest in Savannakhet. The number of pharmacists per 1,000 km\u00b2 was highest in Vientiane prefecture, and very low in many provinces. Only 12 (1.3%) pharmacists reported training in clinical pharmacy. The most prevalent activities were evaluating drug therapy (96.4%), upholding professionalism (96.4%), and committing professionalism (94.9%). The least prevalent were locating evidence (56.8%), applying knowledge (58.9%), and demonstrating continuing professional development (59.7%). Differences in practices were noted between age, qualification, and hospital types. Current major activities included rational drug use, antibiotic stewardship, and managing adverse drug reactions. Future expectations included diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus, and tuberculosis clinics. Clinical pharmacy services like patient care and pharmacotherapy management are frequently provided, but there is a shortage of trained clinical pharmacists and variability in practices between hospitals and regions. Technical support, training programmes, and a clinical pharmacy framework are needed in Lao PDR.",

The SA Ministry of Health (MOH) has initiated several programs and policies to enhance QUM including a National Medication Safety Program, national clinical guidelines, and technology-based strategies. To assess the published literature on the range, quality, and effectiveness of QUM methods in the SA health system. Comprehensive search of electronic databases Scopus, Medline, and PubMed for papers reporting evaluation of QUM interventions or programs in SA. QUM programs involving medication reconciliation, interventions by hospital pharmacists, antibiotics stewardship, technology and staff training are the most commonly used programs reported in SA. Evaluations of several QUM interventions found a significant positive impact on health outcomes, prescribing patterns, chronic disease management, medication safety, and healthcare costs. Medication reconciliation programs reduced discrepancies by up to 20% in some studies. Hospital pharmacist interventions showed high acceptance rates (up to 92%) and improved medication safety. Antibiotic stewardship programs effectively reduced antimicrobial use and costs. Health information technology implementations like electronic health records (EHR), and computerized physician order entry (CPOE) showed mixed results but generally improved medication safety and efficiency. Staff training initiatives enhanced healthcare professionals' knowledge and skills in medication management. While SA has national QUM policies and programs, and evidence that individual QUM interventions have significant positive local impact, more large-scale, multi-center studies are needed to provide a comprehensive view of QUM practices.\u00a0More rigorous evaluations of existing programs and expansion of the range of QUM programs to align with international ones could further improve medication safety and patient outcomes in Saudi Arabia.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance (AMR) is a significant worldwide health problem, with inappropriate antibiotic prescription being a major contributing factor. Prudent antibiotic use is essential for enhancing health outcomes and reducing AMR. This study assesses antibiotic prescribing practices and their logic in a public community health facility catering to 12,900 urban and rural populations in North India. Cross-sectional research was performed from August 2021 to August 2022, examining 1219 outpatient antibiotic prescriptions. The data encompassed medication kind, dose, duration, adherence to therapeutic criteria, and rationale evaluated by ID specialists and clinical pharmacologists. The evaluation was conducted in accordance with standard procedures, including those from NCDC and PGIMER. Demographics, antibiotic classifications, WHO AWaRe categories, diagnoses, and compliance with the essential drug list (EDL) were evaluated. The results indicated that 45.9\u00a0% of prescriptions were for males and 54\u00a0% for females, predominantly involving individuals aged 20-40 years. Amoxicillin\u00a0+\u00a0clavulanic acid (27.2\u00a0%) was the most often given antibiotic, followed by metronidazole (13.4\u00a0%) and azithromycin (10.3\u00a0%). The WHO AWaRe categorization revealed that 49.7\u00a0% of antibiotics were categorized as \"Access,\" 27.3\u00a0% as \"Watch,\" and none as \"Reserve.\" An examination of rationality indicated that 57\u00a0% of urinary tract infection prescriptions were justified, but just 29\u00a0% of respiratory tract infection prescriptions were deemed logical. Diarrhea and respiratory tract infections were recognized as primary targets for minimizing superfluous antibiotic consumption. The research underscores the necessity for enhanced antibiotic prescription protocols in outpatient environments. Specialized education for healthcare professionals, improved prescription oversight, and compliance with evidence-based protocols are essential for fostering judicious antibiotic utilization and addressing AMR.",

Effective AMR surveillance is essential to guide interventions and maintain treatment efficacy. While AMR surveillance is studied in various healthcare settings, data sources in primary care settings need to be evaluated. To identify the value of utilizing AMR surveillance data in primary care settings to inform community antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) practices. Eligibility criteria included primary studies, randomized and nonrandomised controlled trials, observational studies, surveys, qualitative studies, mixed-method studies, and grey literature in primary care published worldwide from 2001 to 2024. Our review of 21 included studies emphasized the significance of utilizing AMR surveillance data to enhance clinical care. Clinicians need to better understand the local AMR pattern when prescribing primary care antibiotics. Despite limitations, educational interventions can change prescribing behaviour. AMR increased because local susceptibility data frequently did not inform empirical antibiotic treatment. Digital and geospatial platforms could enhance surveillance with institutional support and standardized data integration. This analysis highlights the need for user-friendly, real-time, and easily accessible data visualization platforms to improve AMR surveillance and AMS in primary care. Addressing data accessibility and providing training and education are crucial elements. Standardising data and utilizing digital technologies can improve decision-making and antibiotic prescribing. These elements must be incorporated into a consistent and adaptive plan for effective AMS interventions and public health outcomes.",

Nevertheless, the spread of antimicrobial resistance has been considerably aggravated by human activities, climate change, and the subsequent increased release of antibiotics, drug-resistant bacteria, and antibiotic resistance genes in the environment. The extensive use of antibiotics for medical and veterinary purposes has not only induced increasing resistance but also other health problems, including negative effects on the patient's microbiome. Preventive strategies, new treatment modalities, and increased surveillance are progressively set up. A comprehensive approach is, however, lacking for urgently tackling this adverse situation. To address this challenge, we discussed here the main causes driving antimicrobial resistance and pollution of the environment by factors favorable to the emergence of drug resistance. We next propose some key priorities for research, prevention, surveillance, and education to supervise an effective clinical and sustainable response.",

A retrospective observational study was performed. The pharmacist was responsible for the development, education, and supervision of the implementation of the local EOS management protocol. In phase 1, the protocol was established completely according to the latest domestic consensus. In phase 2, the protocol was updated and defined which steps should be taken for specific risk factors and situations in which antibiotics were not necessary down to the detail. A total of 9880 neonates were enrolled. The antibiotic use rate decreased from 58.1% before AMS was implemented to 51.9% in phase 1, and further to 31.7% in phase 2 (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Days of therapy per 100 patient days were 30.8, 28.3, and 24.8, respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Multidrug-resistant organism culture rate gradually decreased from 48.2% to 45.5% in phase 1, and further to 37.0% in phase 2 (p\u2009<\u20090.01). No difference in safety outcomes was observed between the intervention and baseline periods. A practical AMS led by a pharmacist can safely and successfully reduce the prescription rate of antibiotics for EOS and the incidence of multidrug-resistant bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Highly important antimicrobial use in veterinary companion animal medicine is frequent and in some cases unjustified. Establishing cautious and evidence-based prescription practices in veterinary companion animal medicine should be one of the key objectives of One Health antimicrobial stewardship initiatives. We aimed to (1) develop a training program on antimicrobial use in veterinary companion animal medicine in Quebec, Canada, (2) quantify the impact of this training on the use of highly important antimicrobials, and (3) identify the factors that could limit such an impact. A total of 54 veterinarians from 35 veterinary facilities participated in the study. Antimicrobials were identified from electronic medical records, prescription rates were calculated and a difference-in-differences estimation was used to compare prescription rates pre- and post-training in 2023, controlling for seasonal trends during the same period in 2022. Participating veterinarians prescribed on average 11.7 antimicrobial treatments per 100 consultations. Two thirds of the systemic antimicrobials prescribed by participants were antimicrobials of very high medical importance, according to Health Canada. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was the most often prescribed antimicrobial and accounted for approximately 22\u202f% of all prescriptions. The training had a limited impact on overall prescription rates. However, a reduction of 55\u202f% in prescription rate was observed for metronidazole, which is most often prescribed in canine patients with acute diarrhea. Interviews were conducted with 11 participating veterinarians to identify obstacles to the implementation of recommended prescription practices. The main obstacles identified were pet owner expectations, fear of therapeutic failure, lack of confidence in the recommendations and unavailability of therapeutic alternatives.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are prevalent in India, affecting approximately 11.3% of the population. India leads globally in lung disease mortality, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, contributing significantly to disability-adjusted life years and mortality rates. The role of clinical pharmacist interventions (CPIs) in optimizing antibiotic use and managing RTIs is increasingly recognized as vital for improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of CPIs in managing RTIs among inpatients at Vivekananda General Hospital, Hubballi, and to identify common drug-related problems (DRPs) using the Hepler-Strand classification system. A cross-sectional study was conducted over 6 months, including 200 inpatients diagnosed with RTIs. Data was collected through patient profiles, treatment charts, and medical case sheets. The study employed descriptive and inferential statistical analyses to evaluate the impact of CPIs on antibiotic therapy and the prevalence of DRPs. The study identified drug-drug interactions as the most frequent DRP (38.30%), followed by drug duplication (31.49%) and improper drug selection (9.79%). Other issues included adverse drug reactions (4.68%), overdosage (5.53%), untreated indications (6.38%), subtherapeutic dosage (2.13%), and drug use without indication (1.70%). CPIs, including prospective audits, prescription feedback, and healthcare professional education, effectively addressed these issues, improved antibiotic appropriateness, and optimized patient outcomes. CPIs significantly enhance the management of RTIs by addressing various DRPs and optimizing antibiotic use. The study underscores the importance of incorporating pharmacists into antimicrobial stewardship programs to improve medication safety, efficacy, and overall patient care in managing RTIs. Continued emphasis on pharmacist-led interventions and adherence to best practices in antimicrobial stewardship is essential for reducing the burden of respiratory diseases in India.",

There is a pressing need to understand the barriers and facilitators of optimal sampling practices for patient safety and antimicrobial stewardship. We conducted a scoping review to identify evidence of factors associated with reliable blood culture sampling, for adult patients with suspected severe infection in acute care in high-income countries. We searched bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL), reference lists and citations between 2013 and February 2024. Findings were mapped to a socioecological framework. We retrieved 1823 records from the database searches; 7 studies were eligible for inclusion, with 8 additional studies identified from reference lists and citation searches. All 15 included papers identified factors at the individual level of influence, including patient factors (demographics, clinical signs and symptoms) and staff factors (knowledge of guidelines, attitudes and beliefs, emotion, clinical experience and training, and perception of economic cost). Evidence gaps existed in relation to factors at interpersonal, situational, organizational, community and policy levels. Our review provides insights into blood culture sampling practices in hospitals, and highlights possible evidence gaps as potential areas to guide future research and inform the development of interventions to improve blood culture sampling in hospitals.

    "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the implementation strategy, unintended consequences, and underlying barriers to mandatory antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programs in China. Face-to-face, in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted in 16 public hospitals in eastern, central, and western China. Hospitals were purposely selected with full consideration to represent both economically developing and developed areas and both secondary and tertiary care hospitals. A total of 111 respondents were interviewed, including 38 doctors, 28 clinical pharmacists, 15 microbiologists, 14 infection prevention and control specialists, 10 experts from medical service departments, and 6 quality improvement experts. A thematic framework analysis was conducted. A common implementation strategy was found among the surveyed hospitals in response to the AMS programs mandated by healthcare authorities. The hospital leadership empowered an AMS team to set AMS-related indicators for each clinical department and each doctor, and adopted core elements of AMS to optimize antimicrobial prescribing. However, the mandatory AMS approach also caused unintended consequences including regulatory circumvention, shift of risk to doctors and patients, and demotivation of healthcare workers. Two key barriers to AMS implementation were identified: (i) poor communication and cooperation between the AMS team and doctors, characterized by a high-power-low-power dynamic within hospital disciplines; and (ii) the profit-driven compensation system, which discourages collaboration and resource distribution for AMS implementation. Mandatory AMS programs should intensify AMS training, promote communication and cooperation between the AMS team and doctors, adjust the compensation system to facilitate better AMS implementation, and offer supportive measures that enable the adoption of strict regulations.",

    "abstract": "In hospitalized patients, inadequate antibiotic dosage leading to bacterial resistance and increased antimicrobial use intensity due to overexposure to antibiotics are common problems. In the present study, we constructed a machine learning model based on patients' clinical information to predict the clinical effectiveness of Piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP) (4:1) in treating bacterial lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), to assist clinicians in making better clinical decisions. We collected data from patients diagnosed with LRTIs or equivalent diagnoses admitted to the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Shanghai Pudong Hospital, Shanghai, between January 1, 2021, and July 31, 2023. A total of 26 relevant clinical features were extracted from this cohort. Following data preprocessing, we trained four models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Gaussian Naive Bayes. The dataset was split into training and test sets using a 7:3 ratio. The top-performing models, as determined by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)-Area Under the Curve (AUC) on the independent test set, were subsequently ensembled. Ensemble model (EL) performance was evaluated using bootstrap resampling on the training set and ROC-AUC, recall, accuracy, precision, F1-score, and log loss on an independent test set. The optimal model was then deployed as a web application for clinical outcome prediction. A total of 1,314 patients primarily treated with TZP as initial empiric antibiotic therapy were enrolled in the analysis. The success group comprised 995 patients (75.7%), while the failure group consisted of 319 patients (24.3%). We constructed an ensemble learning model based on the Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest models, which showed better overall performance. The EL model demonstrated robust performance on an independent test set, exhibiting a ROC-AUC of 0.69, a recall of 0.69, an accuracy of 0.64, a precision of 0.40, a F1-score of 0.50, and a log loss of 0.66. A corresponding web application was then developed and made available at http://106.12.146.54:1020/ . In this study, we successfully developed and validated an EL model that effectively predicts the clinical effectiveness of TZP (4:1) in treating bacterial LRTIs. The model achieved a balanced performance across key evaluation metrics, demonstrating the model's potential utility in clinical decision-making. The web-based application makes this model readily accessible to clinicians, potentially helping optimize antibiotic dosing decisions and reduce both inadequate treatment and overexposure. While promising, future studies with larger datasets and prospective validation are needed to further improve the model's performance and validate its clinical utility. This work represents a step forward in using machine learning to support antimicrobial stewardship and personalized antibiotic therapy.",

    "abstract": "Inappropriate antibiotic prescription for self-limiting respiratory tract infections (RTIs) by general practitioner (GP) registrars (trainees) is less common than by established GPs but still exceeds evidence-based benchmarks. A 2014 face-to-face educational intervention for registrars and supervisors reduced registrars' acute bronchitis antibiotic prescription by 16% (absolute reduction). We aimed to establish the efficacy of an updated registrar/supervisor RTI-management intervention (delivered at distance) on antibiotic prescribing. A non-randomized trial using a non-equivalent control-group nested within the ReCEnT cohort study. The intervention included online educational modules, registrar and supervisor webinars, and materials for registrar-supervisor in-practice educational sessions, and focussed on acute bronchitis as an exemplar RTI. The theoretical underpinning was the 'capability, opportunity, and motivation' (COM-B) framework. The intervention was delivered to registrars and supervisors of one large educational/training organization annually from mid-2021, with pre-intervention period from 2017, and with postintervention period ending 2023. Two other educational/training organizations served as controls. The primary outcome was antibiotics prescribed for acute bronchitis. Analyses used multivariable logistic regression with predictors of interest: time (before/after intervention), treatment group, and an interaction term for time-by-treatment group, adjusted for potential confounders. The interaction term P-value was used to infer statistical significance of the intervention effect. Of 4612 acute bronchitis presentations, 70% were prescribed antibiotics. There was a 6.9% absolute reduction (adjusted) of prescribing in the intervention-group compared with the control-group. This was not statistically significant (Pinteraction\u2005=\u2005.22). Failure to find a significant effect on prescribing suggests difficulties with scalability of this (and similar educational) innovations.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are initiatives designed to reduce the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). ASPs enhance antimicrobial use, prevent errors, maintain guidelines, and monitor usage to reduce AMR. This study aims to shed light on healthcare professionals' (HCPs) knowledge, experience, and attitudes regarding ASPs. This quantitative cross-sectional study, approved by the Research Ethics Committee at King Khalid University (ECM#2022-2023) was conducted in the Aseer region, Saudi Arabia. A validated self-administered online survey was distributed through various social media channels using snowball sampling between September 2022 and June 2024. The data from the online survey was analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics. The sample included 388 participants. Just over half (53.1%) were male, and the remainder (46.9%) were female. Although a slight majority (54.9%) reported familiarity with ASPs, a professional practice gap was found; only 143 (36.9%) of the participants had direct experience working with such programs, while 64.7% reported inadequate training opportunities as a barrier to effective ASP implementation followed by lack of resources, lack of internal policies and guidelines, time constraints and lack of manpower (54.1%, 52.1%, 48.2% and 45.9%, respectively). Despite the high level of awareness across both genders and all HCPs, only half of the participants correctly identified that cutting antibiotic costs is not the primary goal of ASPs. There were significant differences among participants' views toward repeated education and online resources (p = 0.042 and p = 0.024, respectively). While HCPs have a good understanding of AMR, a professional practice gap was found. Thus, the study recommends offering ongoing education and training programs for HCPs. Addressing implementation obstacles, such as resource limitations and unclear guidelines, is also essential.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is a global threat. Australia has high antibiotic prescribing rates with the majority of antibiotics prescribed by general practitioners (GPs) for self-limiting acute respiratory tract infection (ARTIs). Australian GP trainees' (registrars') prescribing for ARTIs may have been affected by the introduction of remunerated telehealth consultations in 2020. Understanding of the impact of telehealth on antibiotic stewardship may inform registrar educational programs. This study aimed to compare the prevalence of antibiotic prescribing by GP registrars in telehealth versus face-to-face (F2F) consultations for common cold (upper respiratory tract infection [URTI]), bronchitis, sore throat, acute otitis media, and sinusitis. A cross-sectional analysis of data from the Registrar Clinical Encounters in Training (ReCEnT) study, a multicenter inception cohort study of registrars' in-consultation clinical and educational experiences. Analysis used univariable and multivariable logistic regression using 2020-2023 ReCEnT data. The outcome variable was \"antibiotic prescribed\" for new presentations of URTI, acute sore throat, acute bronchitis, acute sinusitis, and acute otitis media. The study factor was consultation type (telehealth or F2F). A total of 2392 registrars participated (response rate=93.4%). The proportions of diagnoses that were managed via telehealth were 25% (5283/21384) overall, 19% (641/3327) for acute sore throat, 29% (3733/12773) for URTI, 21% (364/1772), for acute bronchitis, 4.1% (72/1758) for acute otitis media, and 27% (473/1754) for acute sinusitis. Antibiotics were prescribed for 51% (1685/3327) of sore throat diagnoses, 6.9% (880/12773) of URTI diagnoses, 64% (1140/1772) of bronchitis diagnoses, 61% (1067/1754) of sinusitis diagnoses, and 73% (1278/1758) of otitis media diagnoses. On multivariable analysis, antibiotics were less often prescribed in telehealth than F2F consultations for sore throat (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.69, 95% CI 0.55-0.86; P=.001), URTI (adjusted OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.51-0.81; P<.001), and otitis media (adjusted OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.26-0.84; P=.01). There were no significant differences for acute bronchitis (adjusted OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.79-1.45; P=.66) or acute sinusitis (adjusted OR 1, 95% CI 0.76-1.32; P=.99). GP registrars are less likely to prescribe antibiotics for sore throat, URTI, and otitis media when seeing patients by telehealth versus F2F. Understanding the reason for this difference is essential to help guide educational efforts aimed at decreasing antibiotic prescribing by GPs for conditions such as ARTIs where they are of little to no benefit. There was no evidence in this study that telehealth consultations were associated with greater registrar antibiotic prescribing for ARTIs.

    "abstract": "Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate (HoLEP) is a size-independent surgical treatment for benign prostatic hypertrophy. There is currently a lack of data on peri-operative antibiotic prescribing patterns for HoLEP and, thus, no consensus on optimal practices. This study aims to assess peri-operative antibiotic prescribing practices for HoLEP. Members of the Endourological Society (EUS) were invited by e-mail to complete a REDCap survey. The survey inquired about surgeons' practice setting, training, surgical volume, antibiotic prescribing practices and explored different factors that might affect antibiotic choice and duration. A p-value of <\u20090.05 was determined to be statistically significant. A total of 70 Urologists (66 male, 4 female) reported that they performed an average of 108 HoLEPs per year with a mean clinical experience of 11 years. In the case of a negative pre-operative urine culture with a patient who is not catheterized/intermittently self-catheterizing (C/ISC), 96% of urologists would only give a single peri-operative dose of antibiotic. If the patient is C/ISC then 49% of Urologists would give more than a single dose of peri-operative antibiotic when the urine culture is negative. If the pre-operative urine culture is negative, 39% of surgeons would prescribe post-operative antibiotics even when the patient is not C/ISC and this increased to 64% if the patient is C/ISC. The most common factors urologists considered when prescribing antibiotic prophylaxis/therapy were positive urine culture, catheterization status, and a history of recurrent UTIs. Non-academic urologists administered post-operative prophylaxis more often (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and urologists with more experience treated a positive urine culture for a shorter period. There is significant variability for peri-operative antibiotic prescribing practices prior to HoLEP. In general, more antibiotics are prescribed if the patient has a history of C/ISC or infection. Further clinical studies are needed to identify optimal antibiotic prescribing protocols prior to HoLEP.",

National Healthcare Safety Network Standardized Antimicrobial Administration Ratios (SAARs) were used to measure antibiotic use and microbiology results to evaluate four types of pathogen incidence. A novel CE scoring approach used scores to quantitatively assess relationships with CE adherence and outcome metrics using correlation and regression models. Assessments were repeated with 2021 data for Priority CE adherence and to conduct adjusted regressions for CEs and Priority CEs controlling for categorical bed size. Compared to 2022 national data, DoD hospitals in 2021 had a similar proportion of facilities with a SAAR statistically significantly > 1.0. Leadership, Action, and Tracking CEs followed a more normal score distribution, while Reporting and Education were somewhat left-skewed. Unadjusted models often showed a positive relationship with higher CE scores associated with worse outcomes for the SAAR and pathogen incidence. Adjusted models indicated that procedural CEs, particularly Priority Reporting, were associated with better ASP-related outcomes. CEs should be more quantitatively assessed. Results provide initial evidence to prioritize procedural CE implementation within the DoD; however, additional investigation for structural CEs is needed. Patient outcome data should be collected as an important indicator of ASP performance.",

Further practical contextualization and application of current AFS best practices is thus necessary. A panel of leading experts from diverse countries (India, Nigeria, Spain, and the US) was brought together to provide recommendations for practical and effective implementation of AFS in resource-limited settings. We have adapted and contextualized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) seven core elements and the Mycoses Study Group Education and Research Consortium's (MSGERC) recommendations for facilities in resource-limited settings through a resource-stratified approach. Where relevant to facilities based on their context and respective resources across multiple dimensions, facilities may choose to prioritize certain recommendations that may be more immediately actionable before implementing others. We recommend future studies to examine the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and practicality of our recommendations in resource-limited settings to enable them to effectively prioritize, channel or gradually increase resource capacity at hand. AFS interventions should be integrated within a larger systemic framework (e.g. city, state, national, regional, international) with collaboration among institutional leadership, ID specialists, healthcare workers, public, policymakers, and pharmaceutical industry.",

A self-assessment electronic survey was adapted from the CDC and WHO ASP's core elements, considering ASP organization, structure, education, guidelines, interventions, surveillance, monitoring, and reporting processes. The survey was addressed to ASP team leaders in a sample of public and private hospitals carrying out regular antimicrobial stewardship activities in Mexico in 2021 and 2022. Fifty hospitals participated: 32 (64%) public and 18 (36%) private. Fifty-two percent of hospitals had an official ASP document, 12% allocated protected time for ASP professionals, and 34% had an annual plan. Most hospitals had an ASP committee (68%); only 14% allocated funding. Most interventions were restrictive (68%); 61% of hospitals prepared cumulative antibiograms periodically, 54% monitored antimicrobial consumption (DDD/DOT), 44% monitored adherence to guidelines, and 24% monitored the implementation of interventions. The main barriers identified were work overload, insufficient human resources, and hospital reconversion due to COVID-19 (particularly in public hospitals), while the support of hospital authorities was the most important facilitator. This diagnosis provides a baseline for strengthening ASP implementation in the country's hospitals.

During this period, the focus of sanitary structures was to contain COVID-19 mortality and this may have reduced the application of health associated infection (HAI) and multidrug resistant microorganism (MDRO) prevention programs. A search was performed in PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases to identify clinical observational studies that reported the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence or incidence on HAIs and/or MDROs from December 2019 to August 2024 in Italy. Studies were included if they reported a comparison with pre-pandemic period and had a full-text available.

Data were represented in tables and a narrative synthesis was made in the text. Selected studies included 4 studies reporting data on HAI (1497 total patients) and 11 studies reporting data on MDRO (80388 total patients). The majority of the studies reported an increase in HAI prevalence (9-11.1\u202f% range) and MDRO, in particular, gram negative MDRO had an increase range of 0.8\u202f%-45.6\u202f% and gram positive MDRO an increase range of 0.5\u202f%-81.8\u202f% from pre- to post-COVID-19 period in the different studies considered CONCLUSION: These findings underscore the critical need for active surveillance in hospital wards, the implementation of antibiotic stewardship and prescribing programs to mitigate the impact of such crises on healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial resistance.

    "abstract": "There is a need for improved antimicrobial stewardship on dairy farms, and changes will be largely enacted by the farm workers who are responsible for carrying out farm procedures. For this reason, efforts directed at educating and enabling farm workers in antimicrobial stewardship are necessary for compliance with farm-level antimicrobial usage policies. Therefore, the objectives of this research were (1) to determine the competencies needed by dairy farm workers to implement antimicrobial stewardship and to inform educational resource development and (2) explore the farm contexts that influence farm worker antimicrobial stewardship capabilities. Initially, focus group discussions were conducted in person with 6 groups of veterinarians at 3 independent conferences held in the United States. To gain additional perspectives, 2 focus groups were conducted via video link with dairy producers from the midwestern United States. The focus groups had 4 to 8 participants and 2 to 4 facilitators each, and were audio recorded and transcribed for analysis. Discussions were audio recorded, transcribed, and evaluated using inductive thematic analysis, with 9 key themes identified. Participants emphasized that farm workers needed to be willing to learn, to be responsible, and to be consistent in their execution of tasks. Furthermore, farm workers needed knowledge about the rationale behind antimicrobial use strategies and disease mitigation practices. General skills needed by farm workers included good communication, excellent observation, and the ability to follow protocols and keep records. Technical skills required by farm workers related to the handling of animals, attention to cleanliness, ability to properly administer pharmaceutical products, and farm equipment maintenance. The skills and knowledge required differed among farm workers depending on their responsibilities and experience, with greater expectations for herd managers compared with employees who specialized in a specific task such as milking. Farm contexts that affected antimicrobial stewardship included the farm size, which had an impact on the 3 other themes: workplace culture, leadership, and tools. Workplace culture encompassed having an approachable environment and clear responsibilities, and leadership encompassed managerial capacity and veterinary support. Important tools for effective antimicrobial stewardship included relevant and up-to-date protocols, technology, equipment, and a proficient workforce. The evidence provided through these focus groups is useful for informing competency-based educational efforts aimed at improving antimicrobial stewardship on dairy farms.",

We conducted interviews with 19 veterinarians (January-July 2022) to explore factors influencing antibiotic prescribing for cats and dogs. Thematic analysis was performed using a VALUE model and themes were segmented by consultation touchpoints. We observed that veterinary clinics in Singapore heavily prioritised business viability. Existing antibiotic stewardship efforts driven by individual veterinarians were often justified as meeting pet owners' satisfaction instead. National guidelines being loosely followed, but AMR-related values and practices were mostly aligned to those of key decision-making veterinarians. Open discussions on antibiotic prescribing amongst different veterinary professionals and shared decision-making (SDM) with pet owners were common. Audits were welcomed by veterinarians but resource limitations were a major concern. Recommendations to support veterinarians in prescribing antibiotics appropriately for cats and dogs range from formalising antibiotic stewardship as a clinic value, providing collective training for all veterinary professionals, continuing SDM with pet owners, automating tracking of meaningful indicators for monitoring and evaluation, and setting up a feedback system to inform behaviour change.",

Despite its established impact in other regions, its prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility patterns in Uganda, especially among women experiencing spontaneous abortion, remain understudied. This cross-sectional study aimed to determine the prevalence, antibiotic susceptibility, and associated risk factors of listeriosis among women admitted with spontaneous abortion in Ugandan tertiary hospitals.

Risk factors significantly associated with listeriosis included lack of formal education (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]\u2009=\u20097.0, 95% CI: 1.779-27.655), multiple abortions (aOR\u2009=\u20093.3, 95% CI: 1.486-7.427), and consumption of soft cheese, ice cream, yogurt, or ghee (aOR\u2009=\u20094.3, 95% CI: 1.331-14.082). This study provides critical insights into the prevalence, antibiotic resistance patterns, and risk factors for listeriosis among Ugandan women with spontaneous abortion. Findings underscore the need for targeted public health interventions and antibiotic stewardship to mitigate the impact of this infection.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate whether the adoption of conservative surgical techniques in Costa Rica, facilitated by international collaboration and training, achieved outcomes comparable to those in a reference unit in Spain. This retrospective study included 199 patients with histologically confirmed diabetes-related forefoot osteomyelitis: 110 from Costa Rica and 89 from Spain. Data were extracted from two standardized databases. Infection severity was classified according to IWGDF/IDSA criteria. Surgical procedures were categorized as conservative surgery, minor amputation, or major amputation. Antibiotic use and hospitalization rates were compared between cohorts. Statistical analyses included Chi-squared and Mann-Whitney U tests. Patients in Costa Rica were younger and exhibited poorer metabolic control, while patients in Spain had higher rates of comorbidities. Despite more severe infections in Costa Rica, characterized by higher inflammatory markers and soft tissue involvement, 39.1% of Costa Rican patients were treated without postoperative antibiotics, and the median antibiotic duration was significantly shorter (14 vs 30 days, p\u2009<\u20090.001). The rates of conservative surgery were similar in both groups (62.7% in Costa Rica vs 65.2% in Spain, p\u2009=\u20090.63). When excluding cases with soft tissue involvement, conservative surgery was performed in 86.0% of Costa Rican cases and 96.0% of Spanish cases (p\u2009=\u20090.167). This study demonstrates that structured training and international collaboration enabled the adoption of surgical strategies comparable to those in a reference unit in Spain, achieving similar clinical outcomes. The findings highlight the potential for conservative surgery and antibiotic stewardship to optimize care in resource-limited settings while reducing unnecessary interventions.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a critical global health threat, partly driven by the overuse of antimicrobials in livestock production. Addressing this issue requires targeted interventions to influence behavioral drivers behind AMU practices. Behavior change techniques (BCTs) offer a structured approach to designing such interventions, yet their application in reducing AMU on farms remains underexplored. This scoping review systematically maps the current applications of the Behavior Change Techniques Taxonomy version 1 (BCTTv1) in interventions aimed at reducing AMU in livestock, while also identifying gaps in the literature and opportunities for future research. A comprehensive search across academic databases identified 23 relevant studies. Findings revealed the use of 37 BCTs, with commonly applied techniques including goal setting, instruction on behavior, credible sources, problem-solving, feedback on behavior, and self-monitoring. While some studies explicitly referenced BCTs, many applied them implicitly, without alignment with standardized frameworks. Intervention outcomes were influenced by contextual factors including financial, logistical, cultural, and technical challenges. This review underscores the importance of explicitly integrating and systematically reporting BCTs to enhance transparency, replicability, and scalability. Future interventions should adopt tailored, context-specific approaches to address regional and sectoral challenges, ultimately contributing to global efforts in combating AMR through improved antimicrobial stewardship.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance has highlighted the need for effective infectious disease strategies. Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) may reduce antibiotic resistance, adverse reactions, and treatment failures. This systematic review examines ASPs in Saudi Arabia, assessing their efficacy, challenges, and outcomes to improve antimicrobial use and patient care. Searches were carried out in the Ovid, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection databases for studies published from 2007 to July 2024, in Saudi Arabia, following the PRISMA guidelines. Studies that assessed ASPs' implementation, effectiveness, and outcomes in hospital settings were included. Out of the 6080 titles identified, 14 studies met the inclusion criteria, covering different regions of the country, including Riyadh, Jeddah, Dhahran, Makkah, Al-Kharj, and a multi-regional study in Qassim and Riyadh. Various interventions were implemented by the ASPs, such as educational programs, audit and feedback, switching from intravenous to oral administration, and enhanced policies. These interventions collectively led to a decrease in the overall antimicrobial consumption and cost, and a reduction in cases with multidrug-resistant bacteria. The findings of this review highlight the positive impact of ASPs in Saudi Arabia. However, addressing challenges such as data limitations and training gaps is essential to enhance their effectiveness. Expanding education and refining implementation strategies are crucial for ensuring their long-term success.",

In response, the Veneto Region developed governance models to enhance antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) and infection prevention in both hospital and community settings. This study assessed the implementation of these models and explored strategies for improvement. A survey targeting hospital medical and district health management, hospital pharmacies, and primary care pharmaceutical departments was conducted to evaluate governance adherence, resource allocation, training, and reporting practices. Findings were analyzed by a focus group comprising regional experts, infectious disease specialists, microbiologists, and policymakers, which identified critical gaps and proposed actionable recommendations. Results revealed disparities in AMS implementation between hospital and community care, with key challenges including limited multidisciplinary collaboration, inconsistent resource distribution, and gaps in training. The focus group emphasized the need for stronger governance, standardized protocols, and improved communication to address these shortcomings. This study underscores significant gaps and opportunities within the Veneto Region's healthcare system and provides a framework for enhancing AMS and infection prevention strategies, bridging the divide between hospital and community care to combat antimicrobial resistance effectively.",

Whilst there are various impactful training resources available to support clinicians in antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) activities, implementation, reach, and uptake affect how successful they are nationally. This case study explores the feasibility, acceptability, and usefulness of embedding the TARGET (Treat Antibiotics Responsibly, Guidance, Education and Tools) AMS training into a local incentive scheme. Black Country Integrated Care Board (ICB) invited a representative from all associated general practises to a TARGET AMS training event; attendance was linked to a local incentive scheme. Data were collected via a pre- and post-workshop survey capturing TARGET toolkit knowledge, AMS attitudes and behaviours, training feedback, and intention to implement AMS behaviours. Descriptive analyses were conducted. 157 and 101 attendees completed the pre- and post-session surveys, respectively. In total, 89% agreed that attending the session was a good use of their time. The proportions of attendees stating an intention to use the TARGET toolkit and implement a range of AMS strategies following the session were high (TARGET Toolkit: >82%, AMS strategies: >90%). Most attendees planned to implement these actions within 3 months (47%) or within 3-6 months (30%). Results suggest that embedding the training into a local incentive scheme is a viable implementation approach in extending training reach. Although the impact on prescribing rates is not yet available, the high engagement and intention to implement AMS strategies observed should inspire confidence in this approach to training implementation.",

    "abstract": "Approximately half of all antimicrobial prescriptions in intensive care units (ICUs) may be inappropriate, including those prescribed when not needed, in unnecessary combinations or for longer durations than needed. Inappropriate prescribing is costly, exposes patients to unnecessary side-effects and drives population-level antimicrobial resistance, the prevalence and consequences of which are greatest in low- and middle-income countries. However, the implementation of interventions to improve the appropriateness of antimicrobial prescribing has been variable and requires further study. We propose a type III hybrid implementation/effectiveness interventional cohort trial in 35 ICUs in up to 11 low- and middle- income countries. The study intervention is a structured review of antimicrobial prescriptions as recommended by the World Health Organisation. Strategies to support stakeholder-led implementation include development of local protocols, registry-enabled audit and feedback, and education. Evaluation of implementation, and the determinants of its success, is informed by the RE-AIM framework and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research respectively. The primary outcome is a composite measure of fidelity, reach and adoption. Secondary outcomes describe the effectiveness of the intervention on improving antimicrobial prescribing. Qualitative interviews will assess relevant implementation acceptability, adaptations and maintenance. A baseline survey will investigate ICU-level antimicrobial stewardship structures and processes. This study addresses global policy priorities by supporting implementation research of antimicrobial stewardship, and strengthening associated healthcare professional competencies. It does this in a setting where improvement is sorely needed: low- and middle- income country ICUs. The study will also describe the influence of pre-existing antimicrobial stewardship structures and processes on implementation and improve understanding about the efficacy of strategies to overcome barriers to implementation in these settings. This study protocol has been registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (ref NCT06666738) on 31 Oct 2004. https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06666738?term=NCT06666738&rank=1 .",

    "abstract": "Antibiotics are the most frequently prescribed pharmacologic agents in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Antibiotic treatment for suspected or culture-negative sepsis surpasses that for culture-proven infection. Therefore, we sought to reduce our overall antibiotic utilization rate (AUR), defined by total antibiotic days per 1000 patient days (DOT/1000-PD), by 20% within a 4-year period (by December 2023). A multidisciplinary team was convened to develop an antibiotic stewardship quality improvement initiative in our 39-bed level IV NICU. Consensus guidelines for antibiotic duration for common indications were developed. Interventions included educational sessions, antibiotic stop dates, and antibiotic necessity documentation in the electronic health record to standardize provider justification for antibiotic prescription and duration. A total of 552 infants were included in the analysis, 137 in the baseline and 415 in the postintervention period. Overall AUR decreased by 50% from 278 to 140 DOT/1000-PDs. AUR related to culture-negative sepsis diagnoses decreased by 64% from 22 to 8 DOT/1000-PDs. The percent of antibiotic therapy reinitiation within 2\u00a0weeks remained unchanged. Implementation of NICU antibiotic consensus guidelines supported by evidence-based education on culture-negative sepsis diagnosis can effectively reduce antibiotic use in a safe manner, despite a heterogenous, high acuity, level IV NICU population. Multidisciplinary team support and standardization of antibiotic justification in the electronic health record can be coupled to reinforce compliance with established guidelines to promote long-lasting antibiotic reduction.",

    "abstract": "The irrational use of antibiotics in poultry production has far-reaching consequences and continues to impact the fight against antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Africa. In Nigeria, antibiotics are available over-the-counter and are widely used in food animal production for various reasons, including prophylaxis and growth promotion. While this practice may support animal production, it also drives the spread of AMR, posing serious health challenges due to close human-livestock interactions and the country's high disease burden. This study examined poultry farmers' knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding antibiotic use and AMR, aiming to highlight the public health risks and challenges in combating AMR in Nigeria. A cross-sectional survey of 200 poultry farms in Enugu State, Southeast Nigeria, was conducted to evaluate farmers' KAP towards antibiotic usage and AMR. Using a validated, standardized, and self-administered questionnaire, data were collected from farmers responsible for key farm decisions, including input and feed management. The questionnaire comprised three sections: socio-demographic data, knowledge of AMR, and knowledge and practices regarding antibiotic use. Ethical approval was obtained, and participants gave oral consent based on their professional capacity. The evaluation of poultry's farmers KAP regarding antibiotic usage and AMR revealed that the majority of farmers (90.5%) reported using antibiotics, primarily for treating infections (80.5%) or for feed enhancement, growth promotion, and prophylaxis (61%). Ampicillin (75%), ciprofloxacin (71.5%), and doxycycline (71%) were the most commonly administered antibiotics. Monthly administration was the most common (48%), and 89% of respondents believed that antibiotics promote poultry growth. Interestingly, a substantial proportion of respondents (65%) were unaware of AMR, highlighting a significant knowledge gap, with only 16% recognizing the risk of AMR infections. Our study revealed that the surveyed poultry farmers heavily rely on antibiotics, primarily for treating infections and, to a significant extent, for growth promotion, despite their limited awareness of AMR. Ampicillin was identified as the most commonly used antibiotic, raising concerns due to its potential link to beta-lactamase selection amid the country's carbapenem resistance issues. These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted education to address the AMR knowledge gap and reduce the misuse of antibiotics in poultry farming settings in Nigeria.",

    "abstract": "The development of nursing competencies in antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) is influenced by a two-dimensional model, encompassing both internal and environmental factors. In the context of Italian clinical nursing, this study aims to assess and measure these aspects. Employing a cross-sectional online survey design, nurses from various clinical specialties in Italy were involved. The questionnaire assessed individual variables, knowledge, attitudes, practices, as well as structural and process-related variables influencing AMS. Statistical analyses were performed, encompassing descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and multiple linear regression. A total of 1,651 nurses aswered the survey, with a participation rate of 50.8%. The participant demographic revealed that 77% were female, and they had an average of 15 years of experience. Workplace and regional factors were found to significantly impact both AMS practices and attitudes. Surgical nurses reported higher practices scores (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.467, P\u2009<.01), while critical care nurses scored lower (\u03b2= -0.398, P\u2009<.01). Regarding perceptions of structure, workplace characteristics significantly influenced nurses' scores, indicating lower perceptions among surgical nurses compared to their medical counterparts (\u03b2= -0.315, P\u2009<.01). The study reveals the intricate interplay between internal and external factors that impact nurses' AMS competence. This underscores the urgent need for targeted interventions and education initiatives to enhance nurses' AMS competencies. Specifically, addressing variations in settings and nurses' behaviours becomes imperative for achieving improved patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) complicates treatment of healthcare-associated infections, causing high morbidity and mortality, especially among low-birth-weight and critically ill infants. This study evaluates AMR prevalence, risk factors, outcomes and infection control measures at Felege Hiwot Hospital, aiming to guide clinical practices, antimicrobial stewardship, and improved neonatal health outcomes. This mixed-methods study (Oct 2022-Jun 2023) assessed AMR in NICU neonates by analyzing 420 blood samples, environmental swabs, and staff insights. Bivariable and multivariable regressions identified significant variables, and content analysis was used for qualitative data. Out of 420 samples, 35% tested positive for AMR pathogens, with Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci (16.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.9%), and Acinetobacter spp. (5.6%) being the most prevalent. Resistance rates for Gentamicin, Cotrimoxazole, and Ciprofloxacin were alarmingly high (98-100%), while Amikacin demonstrated low resistance (3.0-5.56%), indicating potential efficacy. Among the neonates admitted, 91.8% survived, and 8.2% succumbed. Risk factor analysis revealed that improper PPE usage (AOR 3.90, p\u2009<\u20090.001), non-functional handwashing sinks (AOR 3.20, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and inadequate disinfection practices (AOR 2.70, p\u2009<\u20090.001) were strongly associated with microbial contamination. Environmental factors, including cockroach presence (AOR 1.80, p\u2009=\u20090.040) and high traffic flow (AOR 2.10, p\u2009=\u20090.005), were also significant contributors. The qualitative data analysis confirmed that improper PPE use, inadequate disinfection practices, pest control challenges, and non-functional handwashing sinks significantly contributed to microbial contamination risks in the NICU, aligning with the quantitative findings. This study underscores key factors driving AMR in NICUs, such as inadequate IPC practices and environmental contamination, alongside high resistance to Cotrimoxazole and Ciprofloxacin. Amikacin shows promise as an effective treatment for CONS. Urgent actions, including strengthened IPC measures, staff training, and environmental management, are crucial to combat AMR, ensuring improved neonatal care and outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains a public health threat especially in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs). Urban slum dwellers are at higher risk of developing AMR than the general population. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) regarding antibiotic use and AMR and the associated socio-demographic determinants among urban slum dwellers in Uganda. A cross sectional study was conducted among 371 adults of Bwaise slum in Uganda selected through multi-stage cluster sampling techniques. An interviewer administered questionnaire was used to collect data on participants' socio-demographics, KAP regarding antibiotic use and AMR. The responses to the KAP were aggregated into scores for each participant which were later dichotomized by the mean to form the predictors variables. Analysis was done in STATA 17.0. A modified Poisson regression model was used to determine predictors of each of KAP, while considering a 5% significance level. The study enrolled 371 participants of which 238(64.2%) were females. The median (IQR) age of the participants was 31 [24, 40] years. Over half of the respondents, 205(55.3%) were married and 157(42.3%) had primary level education. Of all participants, 177 (47.7%), 184 (49.6%) and 205 (55.3%) had good knowledge, a positive attitude and good practices regarding antibiotic use and AMR respectively. Being single (aPR\u2009=\u20090.75, p-value\u2009=\u20090.040) was negatively associated with good knowledge of antibiotic use and resistance, while having acquired tertiary education level (aPR\u2009=\u20091.88, p-value\u2009<\u20090.001) and self-employed (aPR\u2009=\u20091.36, p\u2009=\u20090.017) were associated with good knowledge of antibiotic use and resistance. Male gender (aPR\u2009=\u20091.25, p-value\u2009=\u20090.036) and monthly income\u2009<\u2009300,000 UGX (aPR\u2009=\u20091.42, p-value\u2009=\u20090.003) were associated with a positive attitude towards antibiotic use and resistance. Likewise tertiary level of education (aPR\u2009=\u20090.64, p-value\u2009=\u20090.033) was negatively associated with good practices of antibiotic use and resistance. Residents of urban slums have limited knowledge of antibiotic use and AMR with minimal understanding of AMR concepts. Education level, gender, occupational status are key players in people's understanding and practices of antibiotic use and AMR. There's need for context specific health education programs. Health promotion messaging should emphasize AMR concepts and dangers of drug misuse. Antimicrobial stewardship initiatives should trickle down to the local citizen.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global health threat, partly driven by inappropriate antibiotic use. Healthcare students, as future practitioners, must have a good understanding of AMR to contribute to antimicrobial stewardship. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of an educational intervention on healthcare students' knowledge of AMR and to assess patterns of antibiotic use prior to the intervention. A quasi-experimental pre-and-post study design was conducted with unpaired groups of healthcare students. An educational intervention was carried out comprising of two 20-minute PowerPoint lectures, as well as question and answer sessions focused on understanding the spread, impact, and prevention of AMR. A self-administered questionnaire was given as a pre-test and repeated as a post-test immediately after the training. Students' knowledge of AMR and patterns of antibiotic use was assessed pre-intervention while knowledge of AMR was assessed post-intervention. The knowledge was categorised into domains (Understanding Antibiotic and Antimicrobial Resistance; Spread and Impact of Antibiotic/Antimicrobial Resistance; Prevention of Antibiotic/Antimicrobial Resistance). The total score for each domain of knowledge tested was categorized into good knowledge (\u2265\u200980%) and poor knowledge (<\u200950%). The number of participants in the pre- and post-intervention were 185 and 157 students with average age of 17.7 years and 17.8 years respectively. Post-intervention, there was a significant increase in students' AMR knowledge, with correct responses regarding spread and impact of AMR increasing from 40.5% pre-intervention to 62.4% post-intervention (p\u2009<\u20090.001; \u03c6 (effect size\u2009=\u20090.218). The proportion of students demonstrating good overall knowledge increased from 28.1 to 44.6% (p\u2009=\u20090.001; \u03c6 (effect size\u2009=\u20090.171). Misconceptions, such as misunderstanding that antibiotic resistance does not result from the body becoming resistant to antibiotics, persisted but not statistically significant (24.9-17.2%, p\u2009=\u20090.055). Pre-intervention also revealed varied antibiotic use patterns, including the inappropriate use of antibiotics for malaria (51.7%, (n\u2009=\u200976)), and common cold (25.2% (n\u2009=\u200937)). The study findings indicate that educational interventions can effectively improve healthcare students' knowledge of AMR, though persistent misconceptions underscore the need for more targeted educational efforts. Incorporating structured AMR content into healthcare curricula could help the students contribute to antimicrobial stewardship. Future research should evaluate knowledge retention and behaviour changes to optimize the long-term impact of AMR education.",

A total of 406\u200a333 patients were counselled using the TARGET antibiotic checklist, with 10\u200a081 community pharmacies participating in either year and 6209 community pharmacies participating in both years. The most common indications for both years were chest and urinary tract infections with amoxicillin and nitrofurantoin, respectively, being the most frequently prescribed antibiotics for both PQS years examined. A total of 27\u200a898 influenza vaccinations were delivered by community pharmacies prompted by discussions whilst using the antibiotic checklist. In addition, 140\u200a473 patient information leaflets were provided to patients to improve knowledge about their condition and treatment and to support future self-care. The investment in training and resources for community pharmacies through the PQS has provided opportunities for strengthening antimicrobial stewardship by equipping them with the tools to improve patient knowledge of antibiotic use, symptom resolution and antimicrobial resistance using the TARGET antibiotic checklist, as well as other resources from the TARGET Antibiotics Toolkit.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is currently one of the twenty-first century's biggest threats to public health. Addressing AMR is often operationalized as requiring 'behavior change' of clinicians and patients and improving the drug development pipeline. Few studies and interventions have approached AMR as a challenge fundamentally embedded within the cultural fabric of modern societies and their varied economic, social and political organizations. This systematic review aimed to gather and review the available data on the behavioral and socio-economic determinants of AMR in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Articles were sourced from PubMed using search terms across five domains: \"Antimicrobial resistance\", \"Sub-Saharan Africa\", \"Behavioral\", \"Socio-economic\", and specific SSA country names. References were also reviewed for relevant data. This systematic review included original studies published in English between 2015 and 2023, focusing on behavioral and socio-economic factors influencing AMR in human populations in SSA, with AMR as a key outcome. This systematic review identified 30 studies, with 83% (n=25) focusing on self-medication and antibiotic use practices, 67% (n=20) on healthcare providers' practices and knowledge, and 60% (n=18) on community knowledge and perceptions of AMR while 50% (n=15) of studies explored various socio-economic factors. The common themes that emerged from these studies included inadequate evidence-based prescription practices (63%, n=19), financial barriers to accessing antibiotics (50%, n=15), poor community awareness of AMR (53%, n=16), regulatory challenges in antibiotic sales and distribution (47%, n=14), and healthcare infrastructure limitations, including deficient diagnostic capabilities and antimicrobial stewardship programs (40%, n=12). This review's findings provide crucial insights into the behavioral and socioeconomic patterns influencing AMR in sub-Saharan African populations. For AMR interventions to be effective, there is a need for a thorough understanding of people's behaviors and practices about AMR knowledge and antimicrobial use which will help in developing more targeted interventions and policies to address inappropriate antimicrobial use and the spread of AMR.",

A total of 208 out of 450 health care workers completed a Theoretical Domain Framework-based survey, and 16 patients and 12 health workers were interviewed. Survey results were compared by professional category; interviews were analyzed using Critical Discourse Analysis. Professionals with higher education scored higher across most domains. In the \"Optimism\"\u00a0domain, these professionals scored \u22656.0, while others scored \u22645.0. Similar patterns were observed in the domains \"Knowledge\"\u00a0(\u22656.0 vs \u22645.5), \"Social/professional role and identity\"\u00a0(\u22656.36 vs \u22645.79), and \"Intentions\"\u00a0(\u22656.0 vs \u22645.0). Qualitative data highlighted breaks in the continuity of care and gaps in patient knowledge about antimicrobial use. Key barriers included disparities in training, physician-centered decision-making, and patient knowledge gaps. Enablers included health care workers' willingness to learn and home caregivers' understanding of patient conditions. The implementation of the antimicrobial stewardship program depends on addressing training disparities and leveraging health care workers' willingness to learn.",

    "abstract": "Within the United States, dentists represent the top specialty prescriber of antibiotics in the ambulatory care setting. With the growth of antimicrobial stewardship programs an overall decrease in antibiotic prescribing has been observed. However, prescribing within the dental subset has remained steady. To describe implementation of an antibiotic stewardship initiative targeting proper utilization of antibiotic prophylaxis by dentists prior to dental procedures. Academic detailing, a form of educational outreach, was utilized to facilitate prescribing behavior change. An academic detailer met with dental staff in a face-to-face one-on-one manner to align prescribing with current evidence-based practice. During the encounter, developed resources were utilized to deliver key messages focusing on specific prescribing improvements, while robust conversation allowed the detailer to identify and address any prescriber motivations and/or perceived barriers. An antimicrobial stewardship initiative specific to the dental setting, utilizing academic detailing, has not been previously described in the literature. Comparisons of prescribing appropriateness before and after the intervention was performed using a one-way analysis of variance model. Additionally, a single-group generalized least-squares interrupted time series analysis was performed to estimate the impact of the intervention on the level and slope changes before and after implementation on the number of inappropriate prescriptions. There were 257 prescriptions for dental prophylaxis included in the preimplementation period and 42 prescriptions for dental prophylaxis included in the postimplementation period. Dental prophylaxis prescribing appropriateness was greater in the postimplementation period (17.6% vs. 89.8%; P < 0.001). The incidence of inappropriate prescriptions decreased by 25.39 per 1000 population (P < 0.001) between the periods. Academic detailing improved the prescribing appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental procedures at Veterans Affairs Butler Healthcare System.",

Interventions included education, electronic health record changes, audits and feedback, and a time-limited financial incentive. We measured the percentage of eligible patients with AOM offered SNAP as our primary outcome. Our secondary outcome measured the percentage of SNAPs accepted. Our process measure evaluated the percent of SNAP eligibility documentation. Our balancing measure evaluated the percent of return visits for AOM within 14\u00a0days of initial diagnosis. We used control charts to evaluate special cause variation. We reviewed 29\u00a0316 encounters. SNAP eligibility rates ranged from 27.6% to 45.5% over time. The percentage of eligible patients offered SNAP had 2 center line shifts, increasing from 7.2% to 49.7% as the rate of SNAP eligibility documentation had similar center line shifts increasing from 5.7% to 52.7%. There was no change in the rate of return visits for AOM of 4.3%. The number of SNAPs accepted each month had a center line shift increasing from a mean of 20 to\u00a0139. The offering of SNAPs to patients with nonsevere AOM increased as clinician documentation of SNAP eligibility increased.

    "journal": "Journal of pharmaceutical health care and sciences",
    "abstract": "Considering the global threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), Japan implemented a national action plan in 2016 that emphasized antibiotic education for healthcare professionals. However, pharmacy education in Japan lacks comprehensive antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) content, leading to insufficient antibiotic awareness and literacy among graduates. This study aimed to assess and improve antibiotic literacy and awareness among undergraduate pharmacy students at Showa University. Students who were admitted in 2015 were given a 90-min lecture on AMS, covering acute upper respiratory infections, before their fifth-year clinical training in 2019. The lecture was delivered by a certified pharmacist in infection control. A paper-based, anonymous self-administered questionnaire survey on antibiotic knowledge and literacy was distributed to first- and fifth-year students in 2019 and fifth-year students in 2023. The questions in the survey were based on the Antibiotics Awareness Survey 2018. The survey results showed an 82-99% response rate among first- and fifth-year pharmacy students in 2019 and 2023. Although two-thirds of first-year pharmacy students lacked antibiotic knowledge, most fifth-year students had appropriate knowledge. Moreover, fifth-year students had a proper understanding of bacterial infections and antibiotic identification, which improved after clinical training and additional lectures. The percentage of students who would stop using antibiotics when they felt better dropped from 39% among first-year students to 21% among fifth-year students. Fifth-year students were more likely to dispose of leftover antibiotics and less likely to keep them than first-year students. Over 80% of students provided antibiotic counseling primarily for common cold treatments during clinical training. The survey results highlighted gaps in antibiotic awareness among Japanese pharmacy students and demonstrated the positive impact of education. This study emphasizes the need for an antibiotic literacy curriculum, especially for viral respiratory infections, to support efforts in curbing AMR. Moreover, policymakers should develop policies for developing and securing faculty that are knowledgeable in clinical infectious diseases across Japanese pharmacy schools.",

    "journal": "Open veterinary journal",
    "abstract": "While veterinarians have practiced telemedicine in various forms for years, the arrival of reliable, synchronous videoconferencing has increased the use of telemedicine for care delivery, a trend accelerated by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. However, data are sparse on antimicrobial drug (AMD) prescription practices in this setting. This assessment looked at AMD prescription practices among veterinarians using a telemedicine platform for care delivery in the United States. We surveyed U.S. veterinarians online about their most recent telemedicine appointments using association and veterinary college mailing lists and social media veterinary groups. Demographic information was collected along with information on the species of the animal, the chief complaint, treatment recommendations, the type of telemedicine platform used, and if the pet owner discussed AMDs during the appointment before a recommendation was made. A total of 88 veterinarians from 25 U.S. states responded to the survey. Of the 88 telemedicine appointments, 15% (13) resulted in a prescription for an oral antibiotic. AMDs were prescribed for 5% (2/37) of canines and 25% (5/20) of felines; and for a variety of complaints including ear/nose/throat, dermatologic, ophthalmic, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and gastrointestinal complaints. Veterinarians with <15 years in practice prescribed AMDs more frequently than those practicing for \u226515 years (23%; 10/44  AMD prescribing rates in this assessment of telemedicine appointments were comparable to those reported for in-person visits in the United States. Veterinarians with fewer years of experience were more likely to prescribe AMDs during a telemedicine visit, suggesting a higher level of comfort with prescribing among younger veterinarians and highlighting the need for continued education around telemedicine and antimicrobial stewardship.",

    "abstract": "Despite recommendations to limit the use of vancomycin for known resistant infections, it remains one of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). One of the most effective approaches to reducing unnecessary antibiotic exposure is through the implementation of antibiotic stewardship programmes (ASPs). The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of ASPs in reducing the use of vancomycin in neonates hospitalized in our NICU. This study was a quasi-experimental single-centre study for a quality improvement (QI) initiative. Interventions were implemented to limit the use of vancomycin, including education of the neonatal intensive care team, standardization of vancomycin therapy, and prospective audit and feedback. The pre-intervention period was compared with the post-intervention period. The initiation of vancomycin decreased from 166 times in the pre-intervention period to 71 times after stewardship implementations, representing a 57.2% reduction. Total vancomycin days of therapy per 1000 patient days gradually declined from 113 to 45 (60.2%) (P<0.001) during the study period. There was an increase in the Gram-positive growth in the culture of patients who were started on vancomycin (P=0.04). The number of patients receiving two or more courses of vancomycin treatment decreased by 85.7% (P=0.03). This study has demonstrated that implementing effective multi-disciplinary strategies can significantly reduce vancomycin exposure in the NICU. The application of ASP practices and management in the NICU is essential and achievable, without any increase in the duration of hospitalization or mortality rates.",

    "abstract": "Consistent and timely access to antibiotics is a hallmark of an antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) and can be achieved through good procurement practices. However, flawed procurement modules result in poor antibiotic supply management within health facilities of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), including Pakistan, exacerbating antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This study seeks to understand hospital pharmacists' perspectives on the antibiotic procurement process, its efficiency in ensuring consistent access to antibiotics, and the role of clinical pharmacists in rational procurement. Semi-structured interviews with 24 purposively selected hospital pharmacists from secondary healthcare facilities in Punjab, Pakistan, were conducted utilizing a qualitative case study methodology. Data analysis was conducted using MAXQDA 2024 software, following a thematic analysis technique using a codebook approach to thematic analysis. The study identified five central themes: (1) The state of antibiotic use in hospitals is characterized by a lack of antibiotic use policy, resulting in mostly empirical and irrational prescribing practices. (2) Medicine availability significantly influences prescribing decisions, often taking precedence over clinical needs. (3) The procurement process, although structured, is flawed owing to rigid adherence to the Standard Medicine List (SML). (4) Rationality in procurement is compromised by disregard for AMR, with decisions driven more by cost and demand than clinical evidence. (5) The clinical acumen of pharmacists is underutilized in procurement due to multifarious barriers. Antibiotic procurement is the mainstay of implementing an ASP in hospitals. This study elucidates significant policy, practice, and education gaps regarding antibiotic use and procurement in Pakistan. There is a critical need for comprehensive antibiotic policies, including a revision in SML, enhancing pharmacist authority in procurement decisions, more rational prescribing, and ensuring access to antibiotics through more informed and data-driven processes to combat AMR effectively.",

However, the number of antibiotics in clinical development, and US Food and Drug Administration approvals of new antibiotics, have already markedly increased in the last 15 years. Thus, instead of focusing on more economic subsidies, we recommend reducing selective pressure driving AMR by (1) establishing pay-for-performance mechanisms that disincentivize overprescribing of antibiotics, (2) focusing existing research and development funding on strategies that decrease reliance on antibiotics, and (3) changing regulation or law to require specialized training in antibiotic stewardship for a clinician to be able to prescribe new antibiotics that target unmet AMR need. To stabilize the antibiotic market, we recommend (1) establishment of an advisory board of clinical practitioners to more accurately target existing antibiotic incentives and (2) endowment of nonprofit companies that sustainably self-fund antibiotic discovery, creating a bench of molecules that can be partnered with industry at later stages of development.",

A one-day training was developed through partnerships between Henry Ford Health and nursing and midwifery organizations and teaching facilities in Nepal. Quantitative outcome and process evaluations were conducted. Qualitative process evaluation interviews were conducted with purposefully selected trainees. Trainees worked in healthcare facilities in Kathmandu Valley. A total of 126 nurses and midwives participated in the training and the quantitative evaluation. Eighteen trainees participated in the process evaluation interviews. The 10-module program was adapted from AMS and IPC materials from the World Health Organization and the Nepal Ministry of Health and Population, and curricula from previous AMS studies in Nepal. Key outcomes were AMS and IPC knowledge, and decision-making about empirical dispensing of antibiotics. The process evaluation focused on training content, integration into practice, implementation barriers, and recommendations for dissemination. Quantitative data analysis included descriptive and bivariate analysis. Qualitative data analysis included coding, searches, review of coded texts, and identification of patterns and themes.

In the case of antimicrobial medicines, nurses are responsible for preparing medication, and ensuring its correct and safe administration. To describe intensive care nurses' knowledge, attitudes and practices of intravenous antimicrobial infusion administration in the context of access to AMS teaching. Convenience sampling was conducted of all 161 bedside nurses working in three general intensive care units. The nursing unit manager from each unit was requested to provide information detailing unit demographics and AMS activity within the unit (e.g. existence of AMS; nurse inclusion on the AMS team; frequency of AMS rounds; availability of AMS policies, protocols or guidelines; and training on the administration of intravenous antimicrobial medicines). Intensive care nursing management reported cessation of AMS programmes in all three units during COVID-19, with minimal activity in one intensive care unit even before the onset of the pandemic. Responses from bedside nurses emphasised the unavailability of in-service AMS teaching in the units (46.4%). Questions on antibiotic groups scored poorly (55.7%). Respondents (63.8%) indicated that the hospital intravenous antibiotic policy was useful but 21.7% reported that they had never seen this policy in their unit. Opportunities for training on intravenous administration of antimicrobial medications were provided on induction to the hospital (14.5%), or in-service (30.4%) by the clinical facilitators (34.8%), or by doctors (24.6%). Fifty-one percent of respondents reported administering antibiotics through a dedicated antibiotic infusion line. Forty-five percent of respondents used a non-dedicated line, and 56.5% of respondents flushed the line between doses. Results suggest inadequate training. This, coupled with the evident poor access to policies and protocols, may adversely affect nurse knowledge of principles to prevent antimicrobial resistance. This study highlights that a lack of antimicrobial stewardship guidance to bedside nurses persists; that nurses do not always have access to in-service training and policies, protocols, and guidelines; and that flushing the IV administration line following the administration of an intermittent antimicrobial infusion, should be viewed as best practice to ensure the complete delivery of the dose.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant threat to both human and animal health. Educational resources aimed at pet owners raise awareness of AMR and promote antimicrobial stewardship (AMS). To review available AMS educational resources for pet owners conveying key messages and fostering responsible antibiotic use. A review was conducted on various educational materials targeted at pet owners. Key features assessed included content type, target audience, accessibility, engagement level and clarity of key AMS messages. A total of 16 resources targeting pet owners were identified. While many resources effectively communicated the risks of AMR and the importance of responsible antibiotic use, gaps in measurement of long-term behavioural change were noted. Resources often catered to engaged pet owners, potentially neglecting marginalized populations who may benefit from AMS education. Practical guidance on actions like proper disposal of unused medications was limited, although initiatives like the Antibiotic Amnesty campaign showed promise in promoting responsible practices. Educational resources for pet owners on AMS show promise in enhancing awareness and promoting responsible antibiotic use. However, improvements in clarity, engagement strategies and addressing specific concerns of pet owners are necessary for greater impact. Further research is needed to assess long-term behavioural changes amongst pet owners in antibiotic use following exposure to these resources.",

    "abstract": "This article explores antibiotic resistance as a critical public health issue in Bangladesh, emphasizing its growing threat to the nation's healthcare system. As a developing country, Bangladesh faces unique challenges in managing this crisis, with antibiotic resistance posing significant risks due to its multidimensional problems to both individual health and the broader population. We searched for relevant pieces of literature that discuss the antibiotic resistance problem both from a global and national perspective. Based on the importance and our objectives we selected the relevant articles. The perspective was written using the evidence and information available in those articles. Key factors contributing to the rise of antibiotic resistance include the irrational use and prescription of antibiotics in both healthcare settings and agriculture, incomplete doses of antibiotics, and insufficient public awareness. The article also discusses potential policy recommendations, such as the implementation of stricter antimicrobial stewardship programs, enhanced surveillance systems, and public education campaigns to reduce the misuse of antibiotics. In conclusion, antibiotic resistance in Bangladesh requires urgent attention and coordinated efforts from all sectors of society to prevent further deterioration of public health and safeguard future generations.",

This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, perceptions, and observations of community pharmacists concerning antibiotic utilization during and after the pandemic; and offer crucial insights into its impact on antibiotic usage patterns and infection dynamics. This cross-sectional study involved 162 community pharmacists in Northern Cyprus. Data were gathered via a structured survey, including pharmacist demographics, antibiotic knowledge, perceptions of antibiotic resistance, and observations on antibiotic misuse during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The data were analyzed by biostatistical methods. Over 90% of pharmacists demonstrated high awareness of antibiotic overuse and resistance. The average antibiotic use knowledge score was 5.09/7. The majority expressed interest in further education (85.2%) and participation in campaigns (96.9%) to promote appropriate antibiotic use. Notably, 87.7% of participants observed an increase in respiratory infections post pandemic, and 45.7% reported administering more antibiotics, reflecting heightened demand. Furthermore, 63.6% noted increased demand for unprescribed antibiotics, while 45.7% expressed concerns about potential neglect of the antibiotic resistance issue as a consequence of the pandemic. The study highlights critical changes in antibiotic dispensing patterns among community pharmacists during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The results here underscore the pivotal role of pharmacists in antibiotic stewardship, advocating for ongoing education, and stricter prescription regulations to optimize antibiotic use and combat resistance.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a critical threat to human, animal, and environmental health, challenging global efforts to maintain sustainable ecosystems and public health systems. In this review, the complex, cross-disciplinary issues of AMR are explored within the framework of planetary health, emphasizing the interconnectedness of human and veterinary medicine with broader environmental and social systems. Specifically, it addresses the social, economic, environmental, and health dimensions of AMR under the planetary health framework. The social aspects consider how public awareness, education, and healthcare practices shape antimicrobial use (AMU) and resistance patterns. The economic impact evaluates the cost burdens of AMR, including healthcare costs, loss of productivity, and the implications for the livestock and food production industries. The environmental dimension highlights the role of pharmaceutical waste, agricultural runoff, and industrial pollution in contributing to the spread of antimicrobials and resistant pathogens in ecosystems. To illustrate these challenges, a comprehensive literature review using the PubMed and Web of Science databases was conducted, identifying 91 relevant articles on planetary health and AMR. In this review, the knowledge from these studies and additional references is integrated to provide a holistic overview of the AMR crisis. By applying the four pillars of planetary health-social, economic, environmental, and health knowledge-in this manuscript, the necessity is underscored of collaborative strategies across human and veterinary medicine to combat AMR. Ultimately, this synergistic approach aims to shape the policies and practices that safeguard public health, protect ecosystems, and promote a sustainable future by implementing antimicrobial stewardship programs and encouraging prudent AMU.",

    "abstract": "Data regarding Penicillin allergy labels (PALs) from India and Sri Lanka are sparse. Emerging data suggests that the proportion of patients declaring an unverified PAL in secondary care in India and Sri Lanka (1%-4%) is lesser than that reported in High Income Countries (15%-20%). However, even this relatively small percentage translates into a large absolute number, as this part of the world accounts for approximately 25% of the global population. There is a huge unmet need for allergy specialists in India and Sri Lanka. Penicillin allergy management is further compromised by unavailability of skin test reagents, lack of formal training in drug allergy, pre-emptive, non-standardised and unregulated skin testing by untrained operators and a weak health service framework. This has an adverse impact on antimicrobial stewardship, particularly in the management of rheumatic fever, rheumatic heart disease, bacterial endocarditis, syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections. This narrative review highlights the burden of PALs in India and Sri Lanka, as well as gaps in the published literature. It describes current challenges and a pragmatic, cautious and staged bespoke mitigation approach to improve and standardise antimicrobial stewardship in accordance with the World Health Organisation AWaRe guidance.",

An estimated 4.8 million HCAIs occurred in hospitals across Europe in 2022-23. Sixty-four percent of antibiotic-resistant infections in Europe are associated with healthcare. It is therefore vital to identify cost-effective interventions. To summarize the cost-effectiveness evidence of interventions addressing HCAIs in hospitals. An umbrella review was conducted to identify evidence on the cost-effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship, infection prevention and control, and microbiology and diagnostic stewardship interventions for the prevention and clinical management of HCAIs in adult hospital patients. Medline, Embase, and EconLit databases were searched. A qualitative synthesis was undertaken. Twenty-four systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria, with 101 separate analyses extracted and grouped into 10 intervention and 14 infection/organism categories, across various countries and settings. Most evidence focused on screening followed by contact precautions, isolation and/or decolonization, with selective screening most cost-effective. Most infection prevention and control bundles were cost-effective, although interventions were heterogeneous. The evidence base was sparse for the remaining intervention categories, with more research required. The limited evidence suggests that standalone environmental cleaning, hand hygiene, diagnostics, surveillance, antimicrobial stewardship, and decolonization interventions were mostly cost-effective. The cost-effectiveness of standalone personal protective equipment, and education and training interventions was mixed. Most interventions focused on meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and other Gram-positive infections, with more research needed on Gram-negative infections. The comparator was unclear in many extracted analyses. Cost-effective interventions to address HCAIs in hospitals exist, although more evidence is needed for most interventions.",

    "abstract": "To identify the impact of introducing antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) ward rounds. We used an interrupted time-series approach to investigate the impact of implementing AMS ward rounds with in-person feedback from a multidisciplinary team in Hospital-1, also comparing to Hospital-2 in the same city where AMS ward rounds were not yet implemented. Regression models were used to identify predictors of advice given and of whether advice was followed, and associations between advice uptake and length of stay. Introducing AMS ward rounds was followed by new or accelerated declines in ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam use at Hospital-1. Except for ceftriaxone, similar declines were not seen at Hospital-2. Half of reviews (3471/6878; 50%) recommended an intervention; 2003/2726 (73%) subsequently evaluated recommendations were implemented. Senior doctors were more likely than pharmacists or specialist doctors in training to recommend de-escalation/stopping antibiotics and to have their advice followed. The more prior AMS reviews completed, the more likely advice was to be followed. Following advice to de-escalate/stop antimicrobials was associated with a 0.58\u00a0day [95%CI 0.22-0.94] reduction in hospital stay. Multidisciplinary AMS ward rounds reduced antibiotic use and likely reduced length of hospital stay. Senior clinician input and more AMS experience increased advice uptake.",

    "abstract": "Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) account for over 2.8 million annual emergency department (ED) visits and often result in suboptimal antibiotic therapy. The objective of this study was to evaluate a set of interventions in minimizing inappropriate prescription of antibiotics for presumed SSTIs in the ED. Case vignette survey. A national sample of emergency medicine (EM) physicians. Each vignette described a clinical scenario of a presumed SSTI (cellulitis or abscess) and included a unique combination of zero to five interventions (outpatient follow-up, inappropriate antibiotic request flag, thermal imaging for cellulitis or rapid wound MRSA PCR for abscess, patient education/shared decision-making, and clinical decision support). Out of 64 possible vignettes, we asked participants to respond to eight vignettes. Following each vignette, we asked participants if they would prescribe an antibiotic in their everyday practice (yes/no). We built adjusted hierarchical logistic regression models to estimate the probability of prescribing an antibiotic for each intervention and vignette. Surveys were completed by 113 EM physicians. The thermal imaging, rapid wound MRSA PCR, and patient education/shared decision-making interventions showed the largest decrease (15-20%) in antibiotic prescribing probability. Vignettes with a combination of both a diagnostic intervention (thermal imaging or rapid wound MRSA PCR) and a patient education/shared decision-making intervention had the lowest prescribing probabilities. We recommend future research focuses on the development and integration of novel diagnostic tools to identify true infection and incorporate shared decision-making to improve diagnosis and management of SSTIs.",

The MEDLINE (OVID) search returned 45 results. Of these, 26 were excluded during title and abstract screening and 11 were excluded after full-text review. Overall, eight studies were included in this scoping review. In six of the studies, AMS interventions were pharmacist-led. In two studies, they were led by an AMS team which included a pharmacist. Six of the studies used a similar intervention where a pharmacist led the review of antibiotics prior to patient discharge and made recommendations to change therapy where appropriate. The details of how these interventions were carried out vary between studies. Overall, all studies included in this scoping review concluded that pharmacists have a role in providing AMS interventions at TOC. This scoping review summarized available literature pertaining to the role of the pharmacist in providing AMS interventions for antibiotics at TOC. Research gaps that were highlighted are optimal level of AMS training for pharmacists providing AMS interventions, optimal workflow, ideal method of communication to the prescriber, and quality improvement metrics.",

However, the epidemiology and factors associated with MDR Escherichia coli (MDR E. coli) on Ugandan farms are not well known. This study investigated the prevalence, resistance patterns and factors associated with MDR E. coli carriage on chicken farms. Escherichia coli was isolated from each of the 158 chicken farms sampled. The disc diffusion method for susceptibility testing was performed. Clinical breakpoints were interpreted according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. MDR was defined as resistance to three or more classes of antibiotics. MDR E. coli prevalence on chicken farms was 62.7% (95% CI: 55.0-70.3). High resistance was observed against ampicillin 79.8% (95% CI: 72.7-85.4), tetracycline 72.8% (95% CI: 65.2-79.2), cotrimoxazole 55.7% (95% CI: 47.8-63.3), and ciprofloxacin 38% (95% CI: 30.7-45.9). Male farm managers (Adjusted prevalence ratio [APR] = 0.72, CI: 0.55-0.93), attainence of at least secondary education (APR = 0.64, CI: 0.46-0.88) and administration of recommended antibiotic doses (APR = 0.76, CI: 0.59-0.96) posed a lower risk of MDR E. coli carriage while farms without footbaths posed a heighten risk (APR = 1.48, CI: 1.16-1.88). MDR E. coli carriage was highly prevalent on chicken farms in Uganda. This study underscores the urgent need for antimicrobial stewardship and improved infection prevention strategies on chicken farms.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the current status of critical care services in 13 districts of Bagmati Province in Nepal, with a focus on access, infrastructure, human resources, and intensive care unit (ICU) services. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among healthcare workers employed in 87 hospitals having medical/surgical ICUs across Bagmati Province. Data were collected through structured questionnaires administered via face-to-face and telephone survey. Descriptive analysis was used for data analysis, involving frequencies and percentages. From 87 hospitals, a total of 123 ICUs were identified in the province, providing 1167 beds and 615 functioning ventilators. The average ICU bed availability per 100,000 population was 19, ranging from 3.6 in Makwanpur to 33.9 in Kathmandu. Out of 13 districts, 95% of beds were concentrated in just four districts, while six had no ICU facilities. Of the available facilities, 69.9% were owned by private entities. One-to-one nurse-to-ventilated bed ratio was maintained by 63.4% of ICUs during daytime, and 62.6% at nighttime. Furthermore, 74.8% of ICUs had consultants trained in critical care medicine. While essential equipment availability was higher in Bagmati province, gaps existed in the availability of oxygen plants and isolation rooms. Similarly, many ICUs offered continuous medical education and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training, but improvements were necessary in clinical audits, antibiotic stewardship programs, and research engagement. Disparities in critical care resources were evident across districts in Bagmati Province, highlighting the need for a balanced and decentralized approach to ensure equitable access to care. Although there were disparities, numerous ICUs were effectively carrying out multiple critical care procedures. This study suggests conducting a nationwide mapping of ICU resources, prioritizing infrastructure development, optimizing resource allocation, and establishing national protocols.",

The current study aimed to determine the level of perception and practices of physicians regarding AMR in a tertiary-level hospital. Cross-sectional study. A tertiary care hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The study included 360 physicians who worked for more than 6\u2009months in different departments of the hospital. Perceptions of AMR among physicians and secondary outcome measures were to find out the practices of physicians regarding AMR. The current study used 8 defined responses and 6 multiple-choice questions for scoring physicians' perception of AMR and 12 items to score physicians' self-reported practice regarding AMR. After converting these scores into percentages, the median split method was used to categorise them into poor and good categories. Among 360 physicians, 51% were male, the median (IQR) age was 30 (27.0-34.0) years and 46% had private practices. More than half (52%) had a poor perception of AMR but had good practice (57%) with no significant association between perception and practice. The perception of AMR was significantly associated with age (p=0.048), years in practice (p=0.011) and AMR training (p=0.030). Physicians with private practice had 1.71 times higher odds of having a good perception of AMR (95%\u2009CI 2.07 to 2.75, p=0.026) and 2.44 times higher odds of having good practice (95%\u2009CI 1.51 to 3.94, p<0.001). The odds of having a good perception of AMR increase 1.20 times with a 1-year increase in years of practice (95%\u2009CI 1.01 to 1.44, p=0.042). The study revealed that most physicians had poor perception but good practice regarding AMR. Both poor perception and good practice were associated with private practice. To increase good practice and perception regarding AMR, efforts need to be made to establish an AMR education programme for practicing physicians as soon as possible. Moreover, medical audits and continuous quality improvement (such as programmes for antimicrobial stewardship) should be legislated, and monitoring prescribing behaviour and formulating policies accordingly are the way forward in combating AMR.",

Clinicians and clinic administrators participated in semi-structured qualitative interviews, and parents of children 2 years of age or older with a recent diagnosis of AOM participated in focus groups. The Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) guided the study. Interviews were analyzed using the Rapid Assessment Process. Denver Health and Hospital Authority (Denver, CO) led the study. Recruitment occurred at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Nashville, TN) and Washington University in St. Louis Medical Center (St. Louis, MO). Purposeful sampling was used to recruit clinicians and administrators for qualitative interviews. Convenience sampling was used to recruit parents for focus groups. Thirty-one participants (15 clinicians, 4 administrators, and 12 parents) engaged in interviews and focus groups. Factors influencing antibiotic prescribing included patient history, years of practice, familiarity with the patient, concerns with patient medication adherence, and practice type. Clinicians endorsed electronic health record modifications and clinician prescribing feedback as methods to improve patient care and reduce the durations of prescribed antibiotics. Suggestions for intervention optimization and education needs were also obtained. Findings suggest that clinicians and administrators support reducing prescribed antibiotic durations for AOM and are receptive to the proposed interventions. More education is needed to increase parent awareness about antibiotic stewardship and AOM treatment options.

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is associated with significant human and financial costs, particularly among vulnerable populations like older adults living in long-term care homes (LTCHs). Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the leading indication for antibiotic use in this population, with some estimates suggesting that up to 70% of these prescriptions may be avoidable. The purpose of this study is to develop and test novel behavioural science-informed antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) quality improvement strategies in Canadian LTCHs, which aim to decrease unnecessary testing and treatment for residents who lack the minimum clinical signs and symptoms of UTI. The quality improvement strategy is a two-pronged approach that includes 1) targeted education for essential care providers (family and friends of LTCH residents) about UTI and benefits of AMS, which strives to outline a positive role for this group in UTI management, and 2) monthly feedback to LTCH staff on their facility's urine culture ordering rates. The protocol was piloted in a single LTCH; a process evaluation of the pilot implementation served to refine the research protocol, which is being implemented in eight LTCHs across Canada using an eight-month stepped wedge randomized cluster design. This protocol represents a behavioural science-informed intervention to improve AMS across LTCHs.

    "abstract": "Postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) involves using antibiotics after surgery to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs). However, studies have shown that PAP offers no additional benefits compared to discontinuation after surgical incision closure, prompting its de-implementation to prevent unnecessary antibiotic use that may contribute to antibiotic resistance. We conducted this review to synthesize evidence for guiding the design and implementation of effective strategies for discontinuing PAP practice and optimizing antibiotic use in surgical settings. This umbrella review searched for articles from PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus, focusing on reviews conducted on human subjects on PAP to prevent SSIs, published in English language from 2019 to 5th July 2024. This review followed guidelines from PRISMA-P and PRIOR. The risk of bias (methodological quality) was assessed using AMSTAR-2. The pooled risk ratio (RR) was estimated using a fixed-effects model (Mantel-Haenszel method), while I In our umbrella review, we screened 1156 articles, with 28 review articles found eligible for final analysis, involving over 457 primary studies. About 80,483 patients were involved in 9 meta-analysis reviews, which were used to estimate the pooled RR. We found no significant benefits to patients from continuing PAP beyond 24-h post-surgery compared to immediate discontinuation, RR: 1.07 (95% CI: 0.97-1.17, I Prolonging antibiotic prophylaxis beyond 24-h post-surgery did not show significant protective benefits against SSIs. Our findings support the 2018 WHO recommendation for the immediate discontinuation of PAP following surgical incision closure in clean and clean-contaminated procedures. Further de-implementation research studies are needed to guide the effective discontinuation of PAP practice.",

Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are recommended to optimize antibiotic use and combat resistance. However, the implementation of ASPs in low- and middle-income countries faces several challenges. This study aimed to evaluate the implementation process of a multifaceted ASP in 2 pediatric hospitals in Argentina. A qualitative study was conducted in two large public children's hospitals in Argentina, using semistructured interviews with 32 healthcare providers at the beginning and end of the ASP implementation. The study was guided by the normalization process theory. The intervention faced challenges, including limited understanding of its objectives, confusion with existing practices, and insufficient commitment from senior staff. Although junior staff were more receptive, communication barriers with external staff and workload concerns hindered broader adoption. Infectious disease specialists primarily led implementation, with limited involvement of other staff, particularly in training activities. Despite these challenges, participants reported improvements, such as the development of standardized antibiotic guidelines, better interdisciplinary collaboration, and improved communication. However, organizational support and resistance to new practices remained barriers. This study highlights the importance of organizational context and staff commitment in ASP implementation. Tailored strategies that address the specific challenges of low- and middle-income countries are needed to effectively implement ASPs.",

Three hundred nine survey responses were received of which 244 were complete and used in the final analyses. There are significant differences in the ways that different equine veterinarians diagnose and treat bacterial pneumonia based on practice type and training of the practitioner. The majority of practitioners treat with antimicrobials for longer than 2\u202fweeks, and only 53.3% of respondents reported that they \"always\" or \"most of the time\" used culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing to guide therapy.

The Kashmir Valley's unique geographical and climatic conditions, coupled with resource constraints and antibiotic misuse, complicate managing these infections effectively. This study aimed to identify predominant bacterial pathogens in wound infections at a tertiary care hospital in Kashmir, determine their antibiotic susceptibility profiles, and estimate the prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted from January to June 2023 at the Government Medical College, Srinagar. Pus samples from wound infections were aseptically collected and processed following standard microbiological protocols. Antibiotic susceptibility testing utilized the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method, adhering to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS statistics. Out of 4,378 samples analyzed, bacterial growth was observed in 1,921 samples, representing 43.9% of the total. Among the bacterial isolates, Gram-negative bacilli accounted for 73.5%, with  The substantial wound infection burden and high MDR prevalence in Kashmir necessitate comprehensive antimicrobial stewardship and infection control programs. Regular surveillance, education, and research are crucial to address antibiotic resistance and ensure effective wound infection management in the region.",

Utilizing a rapid portable test that measures peripheral blood host gene expression to discriminate bacterial and viral etiologies of infection (the HR-B/V assay on Biomeme's polymerase chain reaction-based Franklin platform), we tested 3 cohorts of subjects with suspected infection: the HR-B/V training cohort, the HR-B/V technical correlation cohort, and a coronavirus disease 2019 cohort. The Biomeme HR-B/V test showed very good performance at discriminating bacterial and viral infections, with a bacterial model accuracy of 84.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 80.8%-87.5%), positive percent agreement (PPA) of 88.5% (95% CI, 81.3%-93.2%), negative percent agreement (NPA) of 83.1% (95% CI, 78.7%-86.7%), positive predictive value of 64.1% (95% CI, 56.3%-71.2%), and negative predictive value of 95.5% (95% CI, 92.4%-97.3%). The test showed excellent agreement with a previously developed BioFire HR-B/V test, with 100% (95% CI, 85.7%-100.0%) PPA and 94.9% (95% CI, 86.1%-98.3%) NPA for bacterial infection, and 100% (95% CI, 93.9%-100.0%) PPA and 100% (95% CI, 85.7%-100.0%) NPA for viral infection.

    "abstract": "Patients with Gram-negative bloodstream infections are at risk of serious adverse outcomes without active treatment, but identifying who has antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to target empirical treatment is challenging. We used XGBoost machine learning models to predict antimicrobial resistance to seven antibiotics in patients with Enterobacterales bloodstream infection. Models were trained using hospital and community data from Oxfordshire, UK, for patients with positive blood cultures between 01-January-2017 and 31-December-2021. Model performance was evaluated by comparing predictions to final microbiology results in test datasets from 01-January-2022 to 31-December-2023 and to clinicians' prescribing. 4709 infection episodes were used for model training and evaluation; antibiotic resistance rates ranged from 7-67%. In held-out test data, resistance prediction performance was similar for the seven antibiotics (AUCs 0.680 [95%CI 0.641-0.720] to 0.737 [0.674-0.797]). Performance improved for most antibiotics when species identifications (available \u223c24\u00a0h later) were included as model inputs (AUCs 0.723 [0.652-0.791] to 0.827 [0.797-0.857]). In patients treated with a beta-lactam, clinician prescribing led to 70% receiving an active beta-lactam: 44% were over-treated (broader spectrum treatment than needed), 26% optimally-treated (narrowest spectrum active agent), and 30% under-treated (inactive beta-lactam). Model predictions without species data could have led to 79% of patients receiving an active beta-lactam: 45% over-treated, 34% optimally-treated, and 21% under-treated. Predicting AMR in bloodstream infections is challenging for both clinicians and models. Despite modest performance, machine learning models could still increase the proportion of patients receiving active empirical treatment by up to 9% over current clinical practice in an environment prioritising antimicrobial stewardship.",

Antifungal resistance (AFR) is increasing globally, with more patients at risk of Invasive Fungal Disease (IFD), highlighting the urgent need to standardize AFS practices in the UK. The aim of this position paper is to understand the current AFS landscape in the UK. A virtual panel discussion was held from September to October 2023 on an online platform followed by a virtual meeting with nine healthcare professionals from across the UK selected for their expertise on IFD management and AFS. The discussion was structured across four topics: current AFS landscape, key elements of an AFS programme, diagnostics and diagnostic stewardship, and unmet needs in education and training. A thematic analysis was carried out. The results represent the collated and summarized views from these activities. Participants reported barriers to implementing AFS and its integration within antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes in the UK. The primary challenge identified was a lack of resources, including funding and staff time. Sub-optimal fungal diagnostics and limited mycology expertise was reported as a barrier to AFS, clinical IFD and AFR surveillance. Approaches to combatting these challenges may include investing in formal mycology networks to serve as centres of clinical expertise and diagnostic hubs. National standards for AFS services and associated outcome metrics need to be established to set a benchmark for centres to improve AFS.",

    "abstract": "In the West Bank, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is increasingly and alarmingly common. Efforts are being made to introduce antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASPs). This study explores doctors' perceptions of AMR and context-specific barriers and facilitators to ASPs at a critical point in national ASP development. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 doctors working in primary healthcare, government and non-governmental hospitals in Nablus in 2019. Two researchers thematically analysed the data. Participants recognized antibiotic resistance as a major threat to health. Few felt that doctors were well informed about ASPs; many had not heard of them. However, there was willingness to expand and begin new education programmes. Barriers and facilitators to ASPs included: (i) doctors were perceived to 'misuse' antibiotics, lack awareness, favour short-term outcomes, and externalize blame; (ii) patients reportedly treat antibiotics 'like analgesia' with high expectations of doctors; (iii) resource limitations make ASPs and infection control difficult-a lack of drugs, laboratory services, infectious disease specialists, and research to develop local guidelines; and (iv) top-down policy is recommended to restrict access to antibiotics without a prescription, but should be coupled with support, collaboration and community action. Doctors' appreciation of the severity of the issue, and willingness for the expansion of existing programmes targeted at their own prescribing practices, provides a strong foundation for successful ASPs. A top-down approach to prevent inappropriate antibiotic prescribing is welcomed by participating doctors. If financial and resource limitations could be addressed, a continued multifaceted approach may enable physician, pharmacist and patient behaviours to change.",

This research was aimed to investigate the occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella enterica in milk, milking environments, milkers' hands, and diarrheic patients in Wolaita Sodo, Ethiopia. We collected 644 samples from 106 dairy farms that include direct milk from cow, bulk tank milk, milkers' hand swabs, teat surfaces swabs, farm floors swabs, milk storage containers swabs, collectors' bulk milk, retailers' bulk milk, and stool from diarrheic patients. Salmonella enterica was isolated using standard microbiological methods (culture-based detection, serology and PCR), and antimicrobial susceptibility was tested using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method against 14 antimicrobials. The overall occurrence of Salmonella enterica was 1.86% (12/644). The detection rate was 2.06% (7/339: 95% CI: 1.0-4.20) along the milk supply chain, 1.94% (2/103:95% CI: 0.53-6.81) in diarrheic outpatients and 1.49% (3/202: 95% CI: 0.51-4.27) in the milking environments. Relatively, higher contamination rate (6%, 3/50; 95% CI: 2.06-16.22) was observed in milk samples collected from milk collectors. The isolates exhibit higher resistance to clindamycin (100%), erythromycin (100%), vancomycin (100%), amoxicillin (100%), ceftazidime (100%), and ampicillin (75%). Of the isolates, 92%, 83% and 67% were susceptible to norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and Trimethoprim, respectively. All the isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR). The study findings showed the occurrence of a considerable proportion of antimicrobial resistant Salmonella enterica across all sample sources, indicating potential transmission risks between cattle and humans via milk, and the milking environment. The alarming multidrug-resistant strains limit treatment options and complicate pathogen control. To prevent transmission and spread of antimicrobial resistant pathogen, proper hygiene practices, public education, and antimicrobial stewardship are essential. These measures will help ensure the safety of milk and dairy products. Further research on genetic relatedness among isolates, quantifying public health risks of milk consumption, and cost-effective intervention options is needed to reduce Salmonella-related morbidity and mortality.",

Machine learning algorithms were developed and trained to predict susceptibility or resistance using over 4.7\u2009million discrete AST classifications from urine cultures in a cohort of adult patients from outpatient and inpatient settings from 2012 to 2022. The algorithms were validated on a cohort from a geographically-distant hospital system, ~1931\u2009km (~1200\u2009miles) from the training cohort facilities, from the same time period. Finally, algorithms were clinically validated in a contemporary cohort and compared to the empiric therapy prescribed by clinicians. Appropriateness of the antibiotics selected by clinicians and the algorithm during the clinical validation was compared. Algorithms were accurate during clinical validation (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0.71-0.94) for all 11 tested antibiotics. The algorithms' accuracy improved as the organism was identified (AUC 0.79-0.97). In external validation in a geographically-distant cohort, the algorithms remained accurate even without additional training on this group (AUC 0.69-0.87). When the algorithms were trained on the antibiogram from the geographically-distant hospital, the accuracy improved (AUC 0.70-0.93). When algorithms' performances were tested against clinicians in a contemporary cohort for the empiric prescription of oral antibiotics, the drug agent suggested by the algorithms more frequently resulted in adequate empiric coverage. Machine learning algorithms trained on a large dataset are accurate in prediction of urine culture susceptibility vs resistance up to 3\u2009days prior to urine AST availability. Clinical implementation of such an algorithm could improve both clinical care and antimicrobial stewardship.",

In New Zealand, over 95% of antibiotics are prescribed in the community, with estimates suggesting that half of these prescriptions are for self-limiting respiratory infections, contributing significantly to AMR. Registered nurses (RNs), especially nurse practitioners and designated nurse prescribers, are well-positioned to play a pivotal role in AMS efforts due to their accessibility and broad skill set. However, their potential remains underutilised in AMS programmes. Aim This study aimed to explore the role of New Zealand M\u0101ori and non-M\u0101ori registered nurses as antimicrobial stewards within the New Zealand health care system. Methods The current knowledge and involvement in activities that mitigate the risks of infectious diseases and AMR of registered nurses was assessed. The educational and organisational support needed to enhance their leadership and engagement in AMS initiatives were identified. Results Findings highlight the need for targeted AMS education, greater participation in stewardship activities, and clarity in RN roles in collaboration with other health care professionals. This research underscores the importance of empowering registered nurses through education and organisational support to strengthen AMS and mitigate the growing threat of AMR. Discussion This study provides key insights into the leadership potential of RNs in AMS and offers recommendations for future policy and education strategies to optimise their role in New Zealand's health care.",

We describe factors influencing antimicrobial prescription at a large tertiary care private not-for-profit hospital in Uganda. We conducted a descriptive phenomenology qualitative study involving face-to-face in-depth interviews of 12 purposively selected prescribers (four intern doctors, six medical officers and two Internal Medicine physicians) in a private not-for-profit hospital in Kampala, Uganda. Audio recordings and filed notes were transcribed verbatim and analysed manually by content analysis. Emerging themes and sub-themes were recorded and reported. Three broad themes emerged: experience with antimicrobial use in Uganda, barriers and facilitators to rational antimicrobial prescription and measures to address irrational antimicrobial use. Participants recognized that antibiotics are often used irrationally, prescribed even when there is uncertainty regarding clinical evidence for infection, and influenced by drug promoters, and noted high levels of antibiotic resistance. Patients' symptoms and clinical signs, previous experience using antibiotics, fear of bad outcomes, patient demand and expectations, influence from senior colleagues, the turnaround time of clinical investigations and drug marketers were the barriers and facilitators to antimicrobial prescription. Prescribers also acknowledged the need to update clinical guidelines, set up hospital antibiograms, and provide continuous medical education on rational antimicrobial use. A complex interplay of intrinsic and extrinsic factors influences antibiotic prescribing decisions in this hospital. Targeted interventions through continuous education and training for prescribers, providing local prescription guidelines and antibiograms and implementing regulations on over-the-counter antibiotic sales are needed to implement robust antimicrobial stewardship programmes to curb antimicrobial resistance successfully.",

Despite stewardship recommendations by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, there is a lack of literature identifying barriers and facilitators to antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) in United States (U.S.) carceral settings. Guided by the Theoretic Domains Framework, we performed in-depth interviews with 68 key stakeholders in Massachusetts carceral settings to contextualize barriers and facilitators to ASP implementation. We recruited 32 people incarcerated in Massachusetts jails and 36 carceral clinicians, correctional officers/administrators in Massachusetts and other U.S. states, and Massachusetts community clinicians for interviews. From the completed semi-structured in-depth interviews, we identified seven salient themes-four barriers and three facilitators-both specific to and across stakeholder groups. Barriers included the following: (1) jail being viewed as a \"dirty place\" that increases the risk of infections; (2) variable awareness and knowledge of AMR and ASPs; (3) clinicians' opposition to change and oversight of their antibiotic prescribing; (4) competing priorities taking precedence over ASP implementation. Facilitators included (5) interest in changing the narrative about carceral healthcare through ASP implementation; (6) opportunities for education about ASP and AMR; and (7) the development of systems, policies, and regulations to improve antibiotic prescribing. To our knowledge, this is the first qualitative study to leverage broad criminal-legal stakeholder groups to inform the next steps in developing and implementing ASPs in carceral settings in the U.S.",

This study aims to evaluate the LTC-CIP\u00a0certification's impact on certificants' IPC practices, programs, and personal and professional growth. An electronic survey was distributed to all certificants in March 2024. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Eighty responses were collected (17% response rate). Key themes were identified regarding certification's impact on IPC practices, including best practice implementation, enhanced knowledge and skills, and increased confidence and professional growth. Respondents reported certification resulted in enhanced program effectiveness, improved staff knowledge and compliance, and increased leadership and influence. Additionally, certificants reported lower infection rates, improved antimicrobial stewardship and vaccine adherence, and stronger data analysis skills. The findings demonstrate LTC-CIP certificants were highly motivated to gain advanced LTC IPC knowledge and apply it to their IPC programs, leading to reported improvements in resident and staff outcomes. This study highlights the LTC-CIP\u00a0certification's positive impact on reported IPC practices, infection rates, and professional growth in LTC settings.

    "abstract": "The integration of behavioral theories in designing antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) interventions aimed at optimizing the antimicrobial prescription in veterinary practice is highly recommended. However, little is known about the factors that influence veterinarians' antimicrobial behavior for food-producing animals in lower- and middle-income settings like Bangladesh. There is a large body of research on the factors that influence veterinarian behavior of prescribing antimicrobials, however, there is a need for more studies that use comprehensive behavior change models to develop and evaluate interventions. Applying the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation for Behavior (COM-B) model, this qualitative study attempted to address this gap by conducting 32 one-on-one semi-structured interviews with registered veterinarians in Bangladesh. In alignment with COM-B constructs and the theoretical domain framework (TDF), thematic analysis (both inductive and deductive inferences) was performed to analyze the data and identify underlying factors that influence veterinarians' antimicrobial prescription behavior. We found that under \"Capability,\" factors such as knowledge of antimicrobial resistance (AMR); ability to handle complex disease conditions; ability to identify the appropriate antimicrobial type, routes of administration, and potential side effects influence prescription behavior by veterinarians. Under \"Opportunity,\" veterinarians' prescription behavior was influenced by lack of laboratory testing facilities, poor farm biosecurity, farm management and location, farming conditions, impacts of climate change, the clinical history of animals and social influence from different actors including senior figures, peers, farmers, and other informal stakeholders. Under \"Motivation,\" national laws and guidelines serve as catalysts in reducing antimicrobial prescriptions. However, perceived consequences such as fear of treatment failure, losing clients, farmers' reliance on informal service providers, and economic losses demotivate veterinarians from reducing the prescription of antimicrobials. Additionally, veterinarians feel that reducing the burden of AMR is a shared responsibility since many informal stakeholders are involved in the administration and purchase of these medicines. Based on our results, this study recommends incorporating the factors we identified into existing or novel AMS interventions. The behavior change wheel can be used as the guiding principle while designing AMS interventions to increase capability, opportunity and motivation to reduce antimicrobial over-prescription.",

    "abstract": "Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is the presence of bacteria in the urine of patients without symptoms of a urinary tract infection. Generally, treating ASB is not beneficial. We aimed to reduce overtreatment of ASB in the emergency department (ED) through a multifaceted de-implementation strategy. A stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial. We performed our study in five EDs in the Netherlands from December 2020 to December 2021. Adult patients with urine cultures obtained during ED presentation were screened for inclusion and we excluded patients with indications for antibiotic therapy. The de-implementation strategy included education, reminders and competitive feedback on baseline results. The primary endpoint was patients with ASB treated with antibiotics. Secondary endpoints included the treatment duration and the number of urine tests ordered (urinalyses and urine cultures) in the ED per 1000 adult patients. In total, 6837 urine cultures were screened. ASB was present in 224/3289 (7%) and 201/3548 (6%) patients, from whom 65/224 (29%) and 46/201 (23%) were inappropriately treated with antibiotics in the baseline and intervention period, respectively (adjusted odds ratio 1.20, 95% CI 0.56-2.62,  Diagnostic stewardship by our de-implementation strategy reduced the number of urinalyses ordered and treatment duration in the ED, but we found no significant reduction in overtreatment of ASB. The trial was registered at https://onderzoekmetmensen.nl/en/trial/25918, on 17-12-2019, registration number NL8242. The first participants were enrolled on 01-12-2020. A de-implementation strategy to reduce overtreatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria In this article, we describe the results of our multifaceted de-implementation strategy we used to reduce overtreatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB). ASB is the presence of bacteria in the urine of a patient who does not have symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI). Antibiotic treatment of ASB is discouraged by international guidelines, since this does not lead to benefits. Inappropriate urine testing contributes to overtreatment of ASB. Therefore, diagnostic stewardship focuses on improving appropriate urine testing as part of antimicrobial stewardship. The de-implementation strategy consisted of education and reminders about appropriate urine testing, and treatment of ASB, and feedback about the baseline period. We introduced this strategy in the emergency departments of five hospitals in the Netherlands. After the introduction of our strategy, the percentage of overtreatment of ASB was not reduced. However, the number of urinalyses ordered was reduced, along with the duration of inappropriate antibiotic treatment. We concluded that the results indicate that multiple steps in diagnostic stewardship are necessary to reduce overtreatment of ASB.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate nurses' baseline understanding of diagnostic stewardship (DS) principles and the impact of an educational intervention on their knowledge and practices. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), driven by inappropriate antibiotic use, is a critical global health threat. Effective antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) requires integrating DS to ensure accurate diagnoses through proper test requisition, specimen handling and timely reporting. However, understanding and implementation of DS remains poor in general, contributing to inappropriate antibiotic use. Nurses play a crucial role in DS, yet their potential is underused, highlighting the need for targeted educational interventions. A quasi-experimental pre-post study conducted from September 2022 to March 2023. A gap analysis assessed nurses' baseline knowledge of DS informing the development of an online training program. In the intervention phase, pre-and post-assessments measured knowledge improvements after the intervention. In phase 1, 310 out of 517 nurses completed the gap analysis, with an average score of 6.59 out of 20 (range: 2-13; median score: 6.5). In phase 2, 228 of 613 nurses completed both pre- and post-tests, showing a significant improvement in scores from 4.69 (median 5), in pre-test to 6.22 (median 6) in post-test. The educational intervention significantly enhanced nurses' knowledge of AMR, specimen selection, culture indications and collection techniques. Sustained training is vital to strengthen diagnostic practices, reduce inappropriate antimicrobial use and combat AMR.",

    "abstract": "PurposeInfectious Diseases (ID) pharmacy expertise is crucial for the success of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) efforts. As health systems expand due to mergers and acquisitions, ID pharmacy teams strive to deliver consistent care across the enterprise. This report describes the fusion of multiple AMS practice models during the integration of health systems to optimize and standardize care delivery.SummaryThe merger of two large, community hospital systems necessitated the recalibration of services of both legacy antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs). While there was agreement that ID pharmacists perform daily prospective audit and feedback of antimicrobials and respond to diagnostics and cultures, the prioritization of practices across the enterprise that retained allowances for individual hospital nuance was paramount. The result was a practice model dedicated to consistent patient care regardless of geographic location, socioeconomic status, or reliance on a single ID pharmacist's availability. Additionally, the team coordinates the system ASP, in collaboration with medical staff. This includes implementation of stewardship initiatives, formulary management and guideline and document control. Lastly, ID pharmacists serve as a resource for prescribers and pharmacy staff and leadership.ConclusionThe development of a standardized ID pharmacy practice model delivered through a hybrid of remote and in-person coverage addressed disparities in clinical services, education and ASP management. Complexities such as care gaps during leave are reconciled with this process while maintaining the minimum expectations of every ID pharmacist. This was especially crucial to establish consistent patient care across state lines with the rise of virtual services and inability to develop on-site rapport.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is a global health crisis exacerbated by excessive and inappropriate use of antibiotics, especially among low- and middle-income countries including Pakistan. The paediatric population is a key area in view of their vulnerability and excessive prescribing of antibiotics in Pakistan. Consequently, there is an urgent need to robustly assess antimicrobial use among hospitalized neonates and children in tertiary hospitals in Pakistan as they are generally the training centres for new physicians subsequently treating children. A point prevalence survey (PPS) was conducted in the children's wards of 14 tertiary care hospitals in Punjab Province, covering over 50% of the population of Pakistan. This builds on a previous PPS among tertiary care hospitals treating exclusively neonates and children. A total of 1811 neonates and children were surveyed with 1744 patients prescribed antibiotics, a prevalence of 96.3%. A total of 2747 antibiotics were prescribed to these 1744 neonates and children, averaging 1.57 antibiotics per patient. Overall, 57.7% of the patients were prescribed one antibiotic and 27.2% two antibiotics, with 85.6% of antibiotics administered parenterally. Over a third (34.4%) of the antibiotics were prescribed prophylactically, with 44.7% of them for surgical procedures. Among those prescribed antibiotics for surgical procedures, 75.2% were prescribed for more than one day. Overall, 92.2% of antibiotics were prescribed empirically, with 86.2% prescribed without mentioning the rationale for their choice in the notes, with 77.6% having no stop date. Respiratory tract infections were the most common indication (43.4%).  A very high prevalence of antibiotic use among neonates and children in tertiary hospitals in Pakistan, including Watch antibiotics, mirroring previous studies. Consequently, initiatives including antimicrobial stewardship programmes are urgently needed to address current inappropriate prescribing.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotics are frequently prescribed for neonates and children. However, this can be excessive with inappropriate prescribing leading to increased antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Paediatricians are key initiators of antibiotics. Consequently, their awareness, perceptions, readiness and potential barriers towards hospital-based antimicrobial stewardship programmes are of considerable importance, especially in Pakistan with high rates of AMR. A web-based cross-sectional survey among paediatricians from June to August 2023 using a validated questionnaire. Paediatricians from all four Provinces and the capital territory of Pakistan were invited from randomly selected public and private sector hospitals. 383 paediatricians participated (79.8% response rate). Most were male (87.7%), aged 35\u2005years or less (55.4%), working in tertiary care hospitals (68.4%) and undertaking 51-100 child consultations every day (45%). Only 15% reported obtaining training on antibiotic usage, AMR and/or antimicrobial stewardship. Only 7.6% confirmed functional antimicrobial stewardship programmes in their institutions. Most had adequate knowledge of antibiotic use and AMR. However, key issues were not fully understood with only 27.4% believing antibiotics were being overused among children. Paediatricians with less experience, and who undertook fewer consultations per day, had significantly lower knowledge scores. Most participants were prepared to initiate antimicrobial stewardship programmes; however, perceived barriers included a lack of online learning sources, treatment guidelines and support from hospital administration. Paediatricians had appropriate knowledge about antibiotic use and AMR although concerns with antibiotic use. Important barriers to integrating antimicrobial stewardship programmes were identified, which need addressing for these to become routine.",

    "abstract": "The pressing need for better antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) is invariably reliant on educational interventions in some form. To evaluate the effectiveness of post-qualification educational interventions for AMS behaviour change among health professionals. Seven databases were searched for articles published between 2013 and 2024 for post-qualification educational interventions aimed at health professionals to improve AMS. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental designs such as non-randomised trials, controlled and non-controlled before and after studies, and qualitative studies were considered eligible. The quality of studies was assessed using Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) criteria for RCTs and interrupted time series designs, and the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) for all other studies. Data were extracted, analysed for effectiveness, and synthesised narratively. Registration: PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO 2023 CRD42023447115). Forty-six studies were included in the review, with six meeting the EPOC criteria. The remaining forty were assessed using the MMAT. The overall risk of bias for the six studies meeting the EPOC criteria was low, but risk of bias was high for studies assessed using the MMAT. Overall, there was some evidence that formal education alone was effective in this context, but only limited evidence about what type of educational intervention, for which profession, is most effective. Our review provided an in-depth examination of post-qualification AMS interventions. We found studies were heterogeneous and quality of evidence relatively poor.

The WHO Access, Watch, and Reserve (AWaRe) classification of antibiotics is essential in monitoring the rational use of antibiotics. Therefore, this study evaluated the awareness of the WHO AWaRe classification of antibiotics among pharmacy professionals in Zambia. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 239 pharmacy professionals practicing in both private and public facilities in Zambia. A questionnaire was used to collect data which was subsequently analyzed using IBM SPSS version 23.0. Of the 239 participants, 63% were male and most were pharmacists employed in the public sector. This study found that 58% of the pharmacy professionals were aware of the AWaRe classification of antibiotics. Consequently, only 36% of the participants agreed that they implemented the AWaRe framework of antibiotics in their healthcare facilities. Most of the participants (74%) agreed that implementing the AWaRe tool can promote the rational use of antibiotics and 98% of the participants were willing to learn more about the AWaRe tool through training or meetings. This study found a low awareness of the WHO AWaRe classification of antibiotics among pharmacy professionals. Our study further revealed that very few pharmacy professionals agreed that they had implemented the WHO AWaRe tool in their healthcare facilities. Hence, there is a need to strengthen antimicrobial stewardship programs by implementing the AWaRe framework and other recommended guidelines for monitoring the rational use of antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "With most antibiotic prescriptions occurring in primary care, antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) interventions must be known, welcomed, and used by primary care physicians (PCPs). The main objective of this study was to evaluate the present awareness about, use of, and perceived acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of a broad range of interventions. A cross-sectional survey was distributed to Swiss PCPs from December 2023 to February 2024. The survey focused on eight AMS interventions: shared decision-making tools, factsheets for physicians, Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) information material, national antibiotic guidelines website, audit and feedback, communication skills training, as well as the use of point-of-care C-reactive protein (POC-CRP) and procalcitonin (POC-PCT) to guide prescription. PCPs' perceived acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility were assessed using 5-point Likert scales. General expectations regarding AMS were evaluated via qualitative analysis of free-text answers. Out of 7456 potentially eligible primary care physicians, 355 PCPs answered at least one question (response rate 4.7%). PCPs were most aware of biomarkers to guide antibiotic prescription in respiratory tract infections (RTIs), such as POC-PCT (67.6%) and POC-CRP (61.1%); the FOPH awareness campaign (57.3%); and the national guidelines website (52.7%). All interventions were rated as acceptable, appropriate, and feasible, with respective mean scores out of five of 3.89, 3.91, and 3.81. Despite the high perceived acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of AMS interventions available for RTIs, their real-life impact may be hindered by insufficient awareness. Additional promotion of those tools could increase their uptake by physicians.",

    "abstract": "Specialized outpatient palliative care (SAPV) is a component of palliative care in Germany, which assists approximately 10% of palliative patients. The majority of these patients have a malignant disease and are at increased risk of complications or severe infection. Antibiotic stewardship (ABS) measures are implemented to optimize antibiotic administration; however, there is little data available in this area, particularly for SAPV. Therefore, we examined the extent to which ABS measures can be meaningfully used or implemented in SAPV. After establishing a corresponding interview guide, 15 experts from specialized areas were interviewed on this subject by the Institute for Market Research in Healthcare Munich (IMIG) through audio-registered individual interviews. The interviews were analyzed using the qualitative content analysis method according to Mayring. All 15 experts participated. The primary benefits cited were greater safety in the prescription and decision-making process for antibiotics in the areas of SAPV and improved quality of life. The implementation of continuous ABS measures for SAPV was considered difficult in some cases and linked to certain prerequisites, such as supportive advice from existing systems. The possibility of further training for SAPV members in the area of ABS was considered particularly advantageous. The implementation of ABS measures in SAPV is feasible in principle; however, it is difficult to implement under the current conditions. Close cooperation with an existing external ABS expert/team will be helpful. This will provide more security for a small, but relevant proportion of SAPV patients, and for the SAPV team treating them.",

    "abstract": "There is evidence of rapidly growing resistance to antibiotics across Africa. We aimed to establish whether blood culture and sensitivity (BCS) testing is a feasible component of the response to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in large Kenyan hospitals. We used a qualitative study design and conducted key informant interviews (KIIs) using iteratively developed, semi-structured interviews with purposively sampled health-care workers (HCWs) within a network of facilities in Kenya called the Clinical Information Network. Only hospital laboratories that either reported fewer than 50\u00a0BCS tests in the previous 6\u00a0months or had not recorded use of BCS tests for the past 6\u00a0months were included in this study. This selection was further limited by considerations of timing, logistics, and data saturation. Our purposive selection of interviewees was guided by the level of expertise, profession, the number of key informants per hospital, and existing relations with the hospital staff. Each interview took an average of 45\u00a0min. Our thematic analysis used inductive coding to identify key themes, and we used causal loop diagrams (CLDs) to explain interactions between themes. The CLDs illustrate how health system issues relate to each other and influence the use of BCS testing in these study settings. We conducted 72\u00a0KIIs across eight tertiary-level Kenyan hospitals between Oct 27 and Dec 2, 2021. Of the 72\u00a0HCWs interviewed, 33 (46%) were women and 39 (54%) were men. The participants consisted of 24\u00a0clinicians, 26\u00a0laboratory staff, and 22\u00a0pharmacists with a median age of 36\u00a0years (IQR 31-40). We found that the main issues that led to insufficient use of BCS testing in these hospitals related to demand and supply. A\u00a0host of issues influence clinician demand for BCS testing, including: the use and uptake of BCS, normalisation of clinical diagnosis, unaffordability of the BCS test, turnaround time of the BCS test, preferential use of alternative biochemistry and haematology tests by clinicians, diagnosis by malaria confirmation, and negative results discouraging clinicians from ordering this test. Similarly, health system logistics or supply issues, including laboratory capacity, support and goodwill from hospital management, and scarcity of refresher training opportunities, hinder the availability and sustenance of BCS testing. The CLDs show that these multiple factors can create mutually reinforcing feedback loops that undermine efforts to provide BCS testing in hospitals. The findings suggest that sustainable and routine provision of BCS testing would require many issues to be targeted simultaneously and continuously at the health system level, which is unlikely to be feasible in the short term for Kenyan hospitals. Therefore, in these settings, alternatives to routine BCS testing-such as the adoption of a targeted or vertical approach and the use of survey-informed antimicrobial stewardship to inform local treatment guidelines-should be considered for the control of AMR.

This study mapped the veterinary antibiotic distribution chain, examined the governance structure of the chain, and analyzed access and usage practices among stakeholders in Malawi. Data were collected through focus group discussions ( The key stakeholders identified included regulators, local pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers, veterinary clinics, veterinary retail shops, animal health practitioners, and farmers. The distribution of veterinary antibiotics was characterized by both formal and informal pathways for importing and distributing veterinary medicines. Additionally, there were issues with antibiotic mishandling such as improper storage on open shelves in direct sunlight and disposal in pit latrines. There was a marked lack of proper antibiotic dispensation training among veterinary medicine shop attendants, and in terms of regulation, there were gaps in coordination and overlapping mandates among regulatory authorities hindering effective regulation. Regulatory agencies need to strengthen oversight of veterinary antibiotics, conduct trainings on antibiotic stewardship with various stakeholders, and enhance public-private partnerships to better manage the informal pathways for importing and distributing veterinary medicines. This multi-sectoral approach aims to ensure responsible use and improve the pharmacovigilance of veterinary antibiotics.",

AFS programmes have not been reported in Australia. To determine the monitoring of antifungal use, AFS strategies and targets, and barriers to AFS implementation in Australian hospitals. An electronic quantitative cross-sectional survey was developed and distributed to public and private hospitals in Australia in February 2018. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the findings. Eighty-three Australian hospitals completed the survey with an overall response rate of 58% (83/143). Most hospitals monitored antifungal use (62/83, 75%). Frequently used AFS metrics included costs (48/60, 80%) and yearly point prevalence surveys (45/60, 75%). Core AFS strategies were commonly in place, including preauthorisation requirements (71/80, 89%) and expert antifungal post-prescription review and feedback (PPRF) (63/80, 79%). Both these strategies were more strictly applied to high-cost, intravenous agents. Formal education (44/79, 56%) and hospital-endorsed guidelines (35/79, 44%) were modestly used. Fungal diagnostics and antifungal therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) were utilised, largely off site. IFD surveillance was infrequently performed (9/77, 12%). Barriers to AFS identified included lack of staff time, prioritisation of AFS, and access to rapid diagnostics and TDM. AFS strategies utilised in Australian hospitals have focused on high-cost, intravenous agents. Although expert oversight of antifungals is evident, many sites omit potentially important targets for AFS, including fluconazole and oral posaconazole. Identifying these gaps and barriers to AFS will guide the development of an AFS model for hospitals.",

    "abstract": "Arcobacter species are emerging foodborne pathogens increasingly associated with human illness worldwide. They are commonly found in the gastrointestinal tracts of animals and are frequently isolated from various food sources, including raw meat, poultry, and seafood. The aim of this study is to investigate the antimicrobial resistance patterns of Arcobacter spp. isolated from human stool samples, animal products, ready-to-eat salad mixes, and ambient water, assess the presence of resistance genes, and explore their potential implications for public health. In this study, a total of 683 samples were collected from the Shahrekord area over a 12-month period. Samples were obtained from human stool, chicken meat, raw cow milk, RTE salad mixes, and environmental water sources. Two different methods were used to detect Arcobacter, depending on the sample type: bacteriological isolation and identification, and molecular identification. After identification, antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify ten putative Arcobacter virulence and resistance genes. The results revealed that Arcobacter spp. were present in 26.06% (178 out of 683) of the tested samples, with varying isolation rates across different sample types. A. butzleri being the most commonly isolated species across all sample types, while A. cryaerophilus was restricted to RTE salads, surface waters, and chicken meat. Notably, A. skirrowii was only isolated from chicken meat and environmental water. The differences of Arcobacter spp. in prevalence between the sample types were statistically significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and no significant seasonal variation was found across the sampling periods (p\u2009>\u20090.05). PCR analysis for ten putative virulence genes indicated that the cadF gene was present in all Arcobacter isolates. Similarly, 83.33% of the tested strains harbored the ciaB gene, while other genes were less frequently detected. Regarding resistance genes, tet(O) (7.69%) was the most identified gene, followed by blaOXA-61 (4.37%). In conclusion, this study highlights the alarming prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in Arcobacter spp. Monitoring Arcobacter spp. resistance can be achieved through surveillance, risk assessments, antibiotic stewardship in agriculture, public education, research collaborations, rapid diagnostics, and harmonized policies, all aimed at reducing contamination and safeguarding public health effectively.",

    "abstract": "Overuse of antibiotics is frequent in nursing homes (NHs) leading to adverse events and selection of resistant bacteria. Antimicrobial stewardship interventions showed heterogeneous effects on reducing inappropriate use of antimicrobials in NHs. This study aimed (1) to analyze antimicrobial prescribing determinants in NHs; (2) to identify which resources for antimicrobial prescribing are used by NHs' physicians (3) understand which antimicrobial stewardship interventions are required and how they should be implemented in NHs. We conducted individual semi-directed interviews with NHs' prescribing physicians in Ile-de-France, France. A thematic content analysis was conducted iteratively. Thirteen interviews were conducted. Participants were mostly women, with a median age of 48 years and a median professional experience in NHs of three years. Participants included medical coordinators, general practitioners and salaried physicians. Main determinants of antimicrobial prescribing in NHs were the perceived risk of infectious complications and discomfort in residents, the difficulty in obtaining microbiological samples and the lack of healthcare professionals to monitor patients. Most participants reported using national guidelines and electronic decision support systems to guide their antimicrobial prescribing. Institutional constraints accentuate situations of doubt and prompt physicians to prescribe antimicrobials \"just in case\" despite the will to follow guidelines and the known risks of antimicrobial misuse. Physicians stated that proper antimicrobial use in NHs would require a major effort but was not judged a priority as compared to other medical issues. Producing guidelines tailored to the NH's context, performing good practice audits with feedback on antimicrobial prescribing, and reinforcing multidisciplinary relationships and discussions between city and hospital professionals were cited as potential interventions. The role of the medical coordinator was described as central. According to physicians, collaboration among stakeholders, providing support and training during the process might prove effective strategies to ensure successful implementation. Antimicrobial prescribing is a complex decision-making process involving different factors and actors in NHs. Tailored guidelines, good practice audits, strengthened multidisciplinary collaboration were proposed as key AMS interventions. Physicians emphasized the central role of the medical coordinator supported by stakeholder engagement, collaboration, training and ongoing support for successful implementation.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial stewardship is critical for the prevention of antimicrobial resistance. A lack of prescribing guidelines makes overprescribing in veterinary dentistry likely and represents an opportunity for improvement of stewardship practices. This study described prescribing practices of residency-trained and board-certified veterinary dentists for dogs and cats undergoing dental procedures. Antibiotic-use data were collected from the first 10 patients presenting for a dental procedure at each of 22 participating clinics beginning on October 2, 2023. 35% of patients undergoing procedures received 1 or more systemically administered antibiotic, most commonly amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin-sulbactam, and clindamycin. Half (43 of 85 [50.6%]) of prescriptions for dogs were for perioperative or postoperative prophylaxis. For dogs, antibiotic duration for prophylactic versus treatment purposes was not significantly different. Common conditions included periodontal disease, tooth fractures, and oral masses. Comorbid conditions were present in 22.3% (49 of 220) of patients. Presence of comorbid conditions was not a risk factor for antibiotic prescribing. Tooth extractions were a risk factor for antibiotic prescribing among patients with periodontal disease, and those with \u2265 11 were more likely to receive antibiotics than those with < 5 extractions. This study characterized antibiotic use among canine and feline dental procedures performed by residency-trained and board-certified veterinary dentists and identified tooth extractions as a risk factor for antibiotic prescribing. The results obtained from this study provide insight into prescribing practices in a referral setting and impetus to develop outcomes-based studies to determine the need for prophylactic antibiotics during specific procedures, especially tooth extractions.",

Despite the availability of international guidelines, there remains heterogeneity in clinical management. The D-PRISM study aimed to develop a global overview of how pneumonias (i.e., community-acquired (CAP), hospital-acquired (HAP), and Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)) are diagnosed and treated in the ICU and compare differences in clinical practice worldwide. The D-PRISM study was a multinational, survey-based investigation to assess the diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia in the ICU. A self-administered online questionnaire was distributed to intensive care clinicians from 72 countries between September to November 2022. The questionnaire included sections on professional profiles, current clinical practice in diagnosing and managing CAP, HAP, and VAP, and the availability of microbiology diagnostic tests. Multivariable analysis using multiple regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between reported antibiotic duration and organisational variables collected in the study. A total of 1296 valid responses were collected from ICU clinicians, spread between low-and-middle income (LMIC) and high-income countries (HIC), with LMIC respondents comprising 51% of respondents. There is heterogeneity across the diagnostic processes, including clinical assessment, where 30% (389) did not consider radiological evidence essential to diagnose pneumonia, variable collection of microbiological samples, and use and practice in bronchoscopy. Microbiological diagnostics were least frequently available in low and lower-middle-income nation settings. Modal intended antibiotic treatment duration was 5-7\u00a0days for all types of pneumonia. Shorter durations of antibiotic treatment were associated with antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programs, high national income status, and formal intensive care training. This study highlighted variations in clinical practice and diagnostic capabilities for pneumonia, particularly issues with access to diagnostic tools in LMICs were identified. There is a clear need for improved adherence to existing guidelines and standardized approaches to diagnosing and treating pneumonia in the ICU. Trial registration As a survey of current practice, this study was not registered. It was reviewed and endorsed by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine.",

    "abstract": "Using antimicrobials wisely is crucial for effective treatment and reducing antimicrobial resistance (AMR). As ocular infections can lead to serious consequences and ophthalmic surgery has a great impact on patients, the application of antimicrobials in ophthalmology needs to be managed in a standardized manner. A multidisciplinary team (MDT) on antimicrobial stewardship was set up by adopting comprehensive management measures and a continuous improvement model with all-staff training and empowerment, information-assisted medical prescription control, and transparent supervision. After intervention, the antibiotics use density, antibiotics utilization rate and antibiotics prophylactic utilization rate for type I incision operation among inpatients decreased from 30.02%, 49.64% and 58.04% in 2018 to 8.78% (decrease by 70.77%), 18.31% (p < 0.001) and 8.93% (p < 0.001) in 2022, respectively; the microbiological submission rate related to antibiotics utilization, etiological submission rate before antibiotic therapy and before combined use of key antibiotics rose from 13.44%, 17.39% and 50.00% to 27.33% (p < 0.001), 51.3% (p < 0.001) and 100.00% (increase by 100%), respectively; the incidence of nosocomial infection and surgical site infection for type I incision operation both reduced to zero, while the use of hand hygiene products markedly increased. For pathogen detection, a total of 489 pathogens were isolated from 2018 to 2022, of which 69.30% were Gram-positive bacteria, 26.02% were Gram-negative bacteria, and 4.68% were fungi. Ocular secretion was the main detection site (89.31%). Antibiotic resistance analysis results indicated that  Multidisciplinary team and information-assisted transparent supervision have displayed obvious effects in promoting the standardized application of antimicrobials in ophthalmology, via distinctly improving indicators relevant to antimicrobial application and nosocomial infection.

The number of ensured beneficiaries, aggregated by the same demographic variables, was collected from the Intermutualistic Agency. We compared the DDDs per 1,000 beneficiaries per day, along with secondary metrics for national and international targets for analogous populations inside and outside NHs.ResultsTotal antibiotic consumption decreased in both populations but remained twofold higher in NH residents. Proxy prescription quality metrics were consistently less favourable within NHs and diverged further during the COVID-19 pandemic. Distinct consumption patterns and greater seasonal fluctuations were observed in NH residents.ConclusionGiven the different infection risks and higher antibiotic consumption of NH residents, AMC surveillance and antimicrobial stewardship efforts targeting this fragile population are needed.",

    "abstract": "To assess and compare the real-world management of catheters and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) among Swiss general practitioners and urologists, encompassing diagnosis, treatment and prophylaxis. An anonymised online questionnaire was distributed among Swiss general practitioners and urologists between January and October 2023 via the networks of Sentinella and the Swiss Association of Urology. The questionnaire consisted of questions on catheter management, including diagnosis, treatment and prophylaxis of CAUTI. Analysis was performed by discipline. Fisher's exact test was applied for comparisons (statistical significance with p <0.05). Out of 175 participating physicians, the majority were involved in catheter management. Urologists exhibited significantly higher levels of competence as compared to general practitioners (67.1% vs 20.9%). Although no significant differences were observed regarding diagnostic approaches between disciplines, unrecommended diagnostic methods were frequently applied. general practitioners reported that they treated non-febrile CAUTI for longer durations, while urologists indicated that they treated febrile CAUTI longer. Additionally, the use of fluoroquinolones was more prevalent among general practitioners compared to urologists, while prophylactic measures were more frequently applied by urologists. Catheter and CAUTI management entail significant uncertainty for general practitioners. CAUTI management varied notably between general practitioners and urologists in terms of treatment and prophylaxis. The use of non-recommended diagnostic approaches and drugs was common. This trend, along with inappropriate diagnostic methods and prophylaxis, may increase antimicrobial resistance and CAUTI morbidity. The study emphasises the necessity for diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship interventions, and proper training in CAUTI management for general practitioners and urologists.",

This systematic review of qualitative studies assessed nurses' knowledge and perceptions of the barriers and facilitators that impact their involvement in AMS programs. This meta-synthesis followed the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for systematic reviews of qualitative evidence. Relevant studies published between 2018 and 2023 were identified through searches on PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar. The studies were critically appraised using the CASP checklist, with 19 articles meeting the inclusion criteria from five continents. Six recurring themes emerged from the analysis of nurses' experiences and opinions regarding their roles in AMS programs. These themes included the organization of AMS programs, availability of resources, training and education, communication, and the evolving role of nurses in AMS. Nurses at every level of the profession might play a crucial role in antimicrobial stewardship. Although active involvement of nurses in antibiotic stewardship requires further exploration and research, this topic is being examined internationally. The literature on this subject primarily analyzes the phenomenon from a quantitative perspective rather than a qualitative one, and it is contextualized more within hospital settings rather than community settings.",

Currently, information regarding the status of ASPs in Mexico is scarce. We aimed to describe the status of ASPs in 12 hospitals from Christus Muguerza Healthcare System. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 12 hospitals, with a previously developed self-assessment tool to calculate each hospital's ASP development score. The self-assessment tool includes 7 standards with 23 items. Score categories were defined as; high, medium, low, or none. The overall ASP development score was calculated using the proportional weight of each standard. Participating hospitals were divided into 2 groups according to their bed count. Statistical analysis was conducted in Excel program (Microsoft, Redmont, Washington). 12 hospitals completed the self-assessment survey. The median overall ASP development score was 32.3%. The highest overall development scores were observed for hospitals with >\u200940 beds. The core elements with the lowest development scores were Education and training, and Reporting and feedback. Unlike hospitals with over 40 beds, those with 40 beds or less had a low development score for Hospital leadership support. The core element with the highest development score was Infection prevention and control. This is the first multicenter assessment of ASPs in Mexico, revealing a high proportion of low-score hospitals. National implementation of ASPs is required to combat antimicrobial resistance.",

The intervention was designed as a 30-minute workshop with a simulation and script delivered online for 130 students as a part of hybrid teaching within the undergraduate curriculum. Learning outcome measures were compared between an intervention group and waitlist-control group using one-way between-groups analysis of covariance tests. Significant differences between groups were found for outcome measures related to short-term knowledge gain and confidence in IPC and AMS in small animal clinical practice. However, lateral knowledge transfer to large animal species clinical practice showed no significant differences. Student feedback indicated that the intervention was an enjoyable and engaging way to learn AMS. The intervention provided short-term knowledge gain in IPC protocols and enhanced procedural skills via active learning and motivation to learn in large groups of students. Future improvements would be to include large animal clinical scenario discussions and evaluate longer-term knowledge gain.",

Of the 37 competencies, 25 of the competencies were taught in more than 90% of schools and another 6 were taught in 80%-89% of schools. Time spent teaching was \"too little\" or \"far too little\" for five competencies according to more than 50% of the respondents. Additional competencies to address extra-label drug use; the use of compounded antimicrobials; the use of antimicrobials for metaphylaxis, prophylaxis, and growth promotion; and the importance rating of antimicrobials were suggested. The ESCMID antimicrobial prescribing competencies had broad relevance and were widely covered in the veterinary curriculum globally.",

All selected farmers participated, 78.1% used antibiotics in ponds. Majority (77.1%) of the farmers did not know what antibiotic misuse entailed and 73.3% mentioned that antibiotic misuse and overuse cannot predispose to residues and resistance. The most frequently used antibiotics were tetracyclines (TCs) (99.2%). Significant risk routes for residue and resistance spread were: contaminated fish and its products ingestion, direct contact with fish and fomites contaminated as well as water and aerosols contaminated in the pond environment. Significant social and cultural that influenced residue and resistance development include antibiotics misuse/overuse (Odds Ratio [OR] = 3.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.62-8.74) as well as poor education and expertise of the farmers (OR = 2.9; 95% CI: 1.24-6.94).

This study aimed to describe the impact of General Practitioners' (GPs) naturopathy (NP) qualifications and phytopharmaceutical prescriptions on the rate of antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory infections (RTI). We conducted a retrospective cohort study using routine data from the CONTinuous morbidity registration Epidemiologic NeTwork (CONTENT), which includes over 200,000 patients across four federal states in Germany. The study included data from  The study included 40,344 patients managed by 36 GPs. Prescriptions of phytopharmaceuticals significantly reduced the likelihood of antibiotic use (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.45-0.52). Additionally, holding a naturopathy qualification was associated with lower rates of antibiotic prescriptions (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.69-0.78). The interaction between naturopathy qualification and phytopharmaceutical prescriptions also showed a significant effect (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.27-1.62). Patient's year of birth influenced prescribing patterns indicating a reduction of antibiotic prescriptions for younger patients, while patients' gender did not reveal a significant effect. Prescriptions of phytopharmaceuticals were significantly associated with a decrease antibiotic prescriptions among GPs, especially when combined with naturopathy qualifications. Training in naturopathic approaches could enhance antibiotic stewardship efforts in primary care settings, suggesting that broader integration of CIM elements into medical training could be beneficial in mitigating antibiotic resistance.",

Implementing community-based Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) initiatives is crucial to address the rising AMR. We developed a bespoke AMS intervention, aligned with the World Health Organization's AMS modules, as a 2-day online educational seminar for community pharmacists. The effectiveness of the workshop was evaluated using pre- and post-seminar questionnaires, focusing on AMS knowledge and attitudes towards antimicrobial usage. Among 528 participants, 489 completed both questionnaires. Pre-seminar, only 59% correctly understood the concept of antibiotic resistance reversibility, which improved to 85.9% post-seminar ( The AMS seminar was well-received and significantly improved the AMS knowledge of community pharmacists. The results underline the need for more AMS-focused interventions in this demographic in Malaysia, contributing to the development of formalized AMS programs. Such initiatives are expected to enhance antibiotic use awareness, encourage optimal antibiotic practices, and positively shift professional conduct in community settings.",

    "abstract": "The primary goal of perioperative antibiotics is to reduce the rate of surgical site infections (SSI); however, in certain surgical procedures, the use of perioperative antibiotics has been shown to have no impact on the rate of SSI. Inappropriate use of antimicrobials increases cost, potential side effects and further promotes antibiotic resistance. This study aims to provide insight into the adherence of South African otorhinolaryngologists to available evidence-based international guidelines. An electronic survey was sent to otorhinolaryngologists in South Africa. Ninety-two respondents indicated that they utilise the following resources to guide their decisions regarding perioperative antibiotic prescribing - anecdotal evidence 27% (25/92), practices of the surgeon's postgraduate training unit 28% (26/92), published international guidelines 28% (26/92), recommendation of their local hospital's microbiologists 14% (13/92). Respondents indicated they take the following factors into consideration to guide decisions regarding perioperative antimicrobial use - 48% (35/92) duration of surgery, 85% (78/92) degree of contamination of the surgical field, 8% (7/92) patient's age, 8% (7/92) degree of blood loss, 22% (20/92) HIV status of patient, and 22% (20/92) patient's access to hospital. Thirty-five per cent (32/92) of respondents indicated they audit their own rate of wound complications. There is significant heterogeneity in the use of perioperative antibiotic prescribing practices and variable adherence to international consensus guidelines amongst ENT surgeons in South Africa. In light of the global increase in antibiotic resistance, this study highlights the need for increased awareness regarding the principles of antibiotic stewardship, pre-existing evidence-based guidelines and the need for a locally-generated South African otorhinolaryngology consensus guideline that promotes safe and rational use of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis.",

We evaluated the feasibility of an implementation strategy to improve nurses' comprehensive documentation of penicillin allergies. We defined feasibility as the uptake and acceptability of documentation procedures. Six-month pre-post feasibility implementation study. Outpatient surgical areas of an academic medical center located in the U.S. The implementation strategy was guided by the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation Model for Behavior Change and included, building an interdisciplinary coalition to iteratively evaluate the implementation effort, educational meetings with surgical prescribers and perioperative nurses, the development and distribution of educational pocket cards, and structured communication messages in the electronic medical record. A total of 426 patients with 487 penicillin allergy records (216 records pre-implementation period, 271 records post-implementation period) were analyzed. Penicillin allergy documentation contained the following information in the pre- versus post-implementation period: symptoms of the reaction (87% vs 87%), timing/years since reaction (8% vs 26%), onset of reaction in relation to taking penicillin (0% vs 21%), how symptoms resolved (0% vs 21%), and penicillin re-exposure (3% vs 21%). Focus groups revealed nurses perceived documentation procedures as highly acceptable. Major drivers of acceptability included the perceived effectiveness of a detailed allergy history and self-efficacy in conducting a detailed allergy history. Nurses perceived the comprehensive documentation of penicillin allergy history intervention as acceptable, and uptake improved following a theory-informed implementation strategy. We offer implementation strategy components to facilitate nurses' engagement in penicillin allergy evaluation.",

This cross sectional survey was to assess the appropriate use of antibiotics for eye infections in an ambulatory clinic in Ghana and possible determinants. The medical records of all patients who sought eye care between January 2022 to December 2022 and were prescribed antibiotics were extracted from the hospital's electronic database. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analyses were then conducted. A total of 1925 patient medical records were extracted, whose median age was 40 years (IQR 26-69), and were mostly females (58.91%, n = 1134/1925). The eye condition commonly treated with antibiotics was bacteria conjunctivitis (33.51%, n = 645/1925). The most prescribed antibiotic was gentamycin (22.96%, n = 442/1925) followed by ciprofloxacin (16.78%, n = 321/1925). These were mostly topical dosage forms (82.13%, n = 1581/1925). Systemic antibiotics prescribed were mostly from the WHO 'Access' class (83.33%, n = 280/338). The appropriate choice of antibiotic prescribed was 42.44% (n = 817/1925) and this was positivity associated with age (p<0.001), number of antibiotics prescribed (p <0.001), the prescription of topical dosage forms (p <0.001), and WHO 'Access' antibiotic class (p <0.034). The level of appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for eye infections was sub-optimal. Antimicrobial stewardship programs, including prescriber education on guidelines and prescription audit to address associated factors, must now be instigated in this hospital to improve future antibiotic use and prevent the rise of AMR.",

    "abstract": "Inappropriate use of antimicrobials can push the environment out of balance, and cause unnecessary waste that can contaminate our soil, animals and waterways. Health professional education is committed to preparing students for antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) and supporting planetary health, but a more multidisciplinary action is needed to curb the expansion of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The aim of this scoping review is to showcase the current antimicrobial knowledge of undergraduate students across the disciplines of medicine, pharmacy, nursing, dentistry and veterinary. This will consequently showcase the gaps and trends across the different disciplines and countries to help inform planetary health multidisciplinary undergraduate curriculums. A search of the existing literature published prior to December 2023 was conducted using CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and ERIC databases. Studies were excluded if they included postgraduate students or discussed the knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of students towards antimicrobial prescribing, AMR and AMS related to a specific learning activity. A total of 144 articles were included. The most represented countries were India and Pakistan accounting for 17% and 8% of the studies, respectively. Single-disciplinary research accounted for approximately 80% of the studies. Medicine was the most represented discipline in both single-disciplinary and multidisciplinary research, appearing in approximately 62% of the studies, followed by pharmacy appearing in approximately 30% of the studies and dentistry appearing in approximately 18% of the studies. Three major priority themes were identified: students are more familiar with the term AMR compared to AMS; inappropriate use of antimicrobials is seen as the main driver of AMR; and the need for more training and education in the field of appropriate antimicrobial prescribing, AMR and AMS. This review has highlighted that there is a need for more AMS interprofessional education (IPE) activities in all five disciplines, and especially within the disciplines of nursing, veterinary and dentistry, as shown by a lack of multidisciplinary research in this area. Most of the knowledge assessments have just touched the surface of AMS and focused on inappropriate antimicrobial use alone. Interdisciplinary planetary health education needs to go beyond these skills and broaden the understanding of other factors that can contribute to AMR such as inappropriate disposal, environmental contamination, monitoring and surveillance, one health, false allergies, and more importantly, how each health professional can contribute to a team.",

The study aimed to assess the current situation and explore potential improvements in antibiotic use among future health professionals in Romania by: (i) evaluating their self-assessed preparedness on antibiotic-related topics, (ii) understanding their perceptions of their role in antibiotic stewardship, and (iii) gathering their recommendations for optimizing antibiotic use. A survey of students' self-assessment of technical preparedness, engagement willingness, expectations, teaching preferences, training received and evolution of situation in Romania. Overall, 41 and 38 questions were asked to medical and pharmacy students respectively. Scores were calculated for preparedness, engagement willingness and teaching preferences to enable various comparisons. Exploratory factor analysis was used to explore the questionnaire construct. A total of 479 participants completed the survey- 233 medical students from 7 universities and 246 pharmacy students from 4 universities. Median overall preparedness score indicated that most students felt prepared in at least 14 questions (out of 22 for medical students, and 19 for pharmacy students). Engagement scores for medical and pharmacy students were similar (2 and 3 out of 4). Overall, more than half reported that 'yes, very likely' they received adequate training to ensure the appropriate use of antibiotics in their professional areas (n\u2009=\u2009254, 53.5%). Medical and pharmacy students with low preparedness scores expressed a need for more education. Most of both medical and pharmacy students considered the antibiotic situation in Romania 'will get worse' (n\u2009=\u2009159, 33.5%). The study's findings have important implications for the education and training of future Romanian health professionals and highlight the need for further research on optimal and standardized tools to allow for periodic monitoring and evaluation of progress into preparedness, engagement willingness and teaching preferences on antibiotic use.",

Individual biochemical tests and analytical profile index (API) biochemical test kits or similar were the most frequent tools used for bacterial identification (77% and 56.2%, respectively), followed by PCR (46.6%) and MALDI-TOF MS (43.3%). For AST, Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion (DD) and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination were conducted by 43.8% and 32.6% of laboratories, respectively, with a combination of EUCAST and CLSI clinical breakpoints (CBPs) preferred for interpretation of the DD (41.2%) and MIC (47.6%) results. In the absence of specific CBPs, laboratories used human CBPs (53.3%) or veterinary CBPs representing another body site, organism or animal species (51.5%). Importantly, most laboratories (47.9%) only report the qualitative interpretation of the result (S, R, and I). As regards testing for AMR mechanisms, 48.5% and 46.7% of laboratories routinely screened isolates for methicillin resistance and ESBL production, respectively. Notably, selective reporting of AST results (i.e. excluding highest priority critically important antimicrobials from AST reports) was adopted by 39.5% of laboratories despite a similar proportion not taking any approach (37.6%) to guide clinicians towards narrower-spectrum or first-line antibiotics. In conclusion, we identified a broad variety of methodologies and interpretative criteria used for C&ID and AST in European veterinary microbiological diagnostic laboratories. The observed gaps in veterinary microbiology practices emphasize a need to improve and harmonize professional training, innovation, bacterial culture methods and interpretation, AMR surveillance and reporting strategies.",

    "abstract": "Ceftriaxone stands as a cornerstone in global antibiotic therapy owing to its potent antibacterial activity, broad spectrum coverage, and low toxicity. Nevertheless, its efficacy is impeded by widespread inappropriate prescribing and utilization practices, significantly contributing to bacterial resistance. The aim of this study is to determine the overall national pooled prevalence of inappropriate ceftriaxone utilization and its predictor factors in Ethiopia. A systematic search was conducted across multiple databases including, PubMed, Science Direct, Hinari, Global Index Medicus, Scopus, Embase, and a search engine, Google Scholar, to identify relevant literatures that meet the research question, from March 20 to 30, 2024. This meta-analysis, which was conducted in Ethiopia by incorporating 17 full-text articles, unveiled a national pooled inappropriate ceftriaxone utilization of 55.24% (95% CI, 42.17%, 68.30%) with a substantial heterogeneity index (I2\u2009=\u200999.24%, p value\u2009<\u20090.001). The review has also identified predictive factors for the inappropriate use of ceftriaxone: empiric therapy (AOR 21.43, 95% CI; 9.26-49.59); multiple medication co-prescription (AOR: 4.12, 95% CI; 1.62-8.05). Emergency ward (AOR: 4.22, 95% CI; 1.8-12.24), surgery ward (AOR: 2.6, 95% CI; 1.44-7.82) compared to medical ward, prophylactic use (AOR: 500, 95% CI; 41.7-1000), longer hospital stay-8-14 Days; (AOR: 0.167, 95% CI; 0.09-0.29), >\u200914 days; (AOR: 0.18, 95% CI; 0.1-0.32). The study reveals a high national pooled prevalence of inappropriate ceftriaxone utilization, standing at 55.24%, highlighting a significant hazard in the use of this antibiotic. This could be attributed to instances of overuse, misuse or prescription practices that deviates from established guidelines. This eminent challenge can lead to the development of antibiotic resistance, increased healthcare costs, adverse drug reactions, and treatment failures, necessitating multifaceted approach such as improved antibiotic stewardship, better adherence to guidelines, and enhanced clinician education on appropriate antibiotic use.",

    "abstract": "We previously reported a cross-sectional analysis of online pharmacy practices and processes. Since then, the demand for and context of online healthcare has changed. However, the current state of access to and usage of antibiotics obtained online remains poorly understood. This study aimed to: (i) determine the legality of online pharmacies selling antibiotics in the UK; (ii) describe processes for obtaining antibiotics online; (iii) identify antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) and patient safety issues; and (iv) compare data with those obtained in 2016 to understand changes in context, and set priorities for targeted research in antibiotic access and usage. Searches for 'buy antibiotics online' were conducted using 'Google' and 'Yahoo'. The first 10 websites with unique URL addresses for each were reviewed. Analyses were conducted on evidence of pharmacy registration, prescription requirement, whether choice was 'prescriber-driven' or 'consumer-driven', and whether information was required (allergies, comorbidities, pregnancy) or given (adverse effects) prior to purchase. Twenty unique URL addresses were analysed. Those evidencing UK location (n\u200a=\u200a20; 100%) required a prescription and were appropriately registered. For 11 (55%) online pharmacies, decisions were initially consumer-driven for antibiotic choice, but not for dose or duration; contrasting with 2016 when for most (n\u200a=\u200a16; 80%), decisions were consumer-driven for antibiotic choice, dose and quantity. Variation continues to exist in relation to antibiotic practices online. We make several key recommendations for lawmakers and stakeholders. Targeted research, improved public engagement, professional education and new best practice guidelines are urgently needed for online UK antibiotic suppliers.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP) often function naturally as facilitators within clinical hospital settings, by working with individuals and teams to reduce unnecessary antibiotics. Within implementation science, facilitation has been studied and evaluated as an implementation strategy that can accelerate and improve fidelity to implementation efforts. This study describes a novel, virtual facilitation strategy developed and served as an intervention within the optimizing perioperative antibiotics for children trial (OPERATIC trial). This paper: (1)\u00a0describes ASP team's preferences for and use of a facilitation workshop and (2)\u00a0describes sustained use of facilitation skills throughout the study period. Study participants included antimicrobial stewardship team members from the nine children's hospitals that participated in this study and completed facilitation training. All individuals who completed facilitation training were asked to evaluate the training through an online survey. Additionally, site leads were interviewed by the site coordinator every other month and asked about their team's use of facilitation skills throughout the rest of the study period. Survey data were managed and coded in R, and qualitative interview data were analyzed using rapid methodology. 30 individuals, including both physicians and pharmacists, completed the evaluation. Individuals largely rated themselves as novice facilitators (53%). Individuals reported satisfaction with virtual facilitation and identified different components of the workshops as valuable. An additional 108 interviews were performed throughout the study period. These interviews found that facilitators reported using all skills throughout the study period and described varied use of skills over time. All nine sites applied facilitation strategies, team building techniques, and communication/conflict skills at some point during the intervention phase. We describe the use of virtual facilitation as an acceptable and appropriate strategy to enhance facilitation skills for ASP teams working to reduce unnecessary postoperative antibiotics. Participants reported different useful components of facilitation training and described using differing facilitation skills throughout the trial. Overall, the use of facilitation skills continued throughout the duration of the study period. This paper outlines how facilitation training can be conducted virtually in a way that is feasible and acceptable to clinicians. NCT04366440, April 24, 2020.",

    "abstract": "Urinary tract infection is the most diagnosed infection in older people. It accounts for more than 50% of antibiotic prescriptions in care homes and is a frequent reason for care home residents being hospitalised. This realist review developed and refined programme theories for preventing and recognising urinary tract infection, exploring what works, for whom and in what circumstances. The review used realist synthesis to explore existing literature on the detection and prevention of urinary tract infection, complemented by stakeholder consultation. It applies to the UK context, although other healthcare systems may identify synergies in our findings. Bibliographic databases searched included MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science Core Collection (including the Social Sciences Citation Index), Sociological Abstracts, Bibliomap and National Institute for Health and Care Research Journals Library. Title and abstract screening were undertaken by two researchers independently of each other. Selection and assessment were based on relevance and rigour and cross-checked by a second researcher. Data extracted from the included studies were explored for explanations about how the interventions were considered to work (or not). Evidence tables were constructed to enable identification of patterns across studies that offered insight about the features of successful interventions. Programme theories were constructed through a four-stage process involving scoping workshops, examination of relevant extant theory, analysis and synthesis of primary research, teacher-learner interviews and a cross-system stakeholder event. A process of abductive and retroductive reasoning was used to construct context-mechanism-outcome configurations to inform programme theory. The scoping review and stakeholder engagement identified three theory areas that address the prevention and recognition of urinary tract infection and show what is needed to implement best practice. Nine context-mechanism-outcome configurations provided an explanation of how interventions to prevent and recognise urinary tract infection might work in care homes. These were (1) recognition of urinary tract infection is informed by skills in clinical reasoning, (2) decision-support tools enable a whole care team approach to communication, (3) active monitoring is recognised as a legitimate care routine, (4) hydration is recognised as a care priority for all residents, (5) systems are in place to drive action that helps residents to drink more, (6) good infection prevention practice is applied to indwelling urinary catheters, (7) proactive strategies are in place to prevent recurrent urinary tract infection, (8) care home leadership and culture fosters safe fundamental care and (9) developing knowledgeable care teams. We adapted our approach and work to online interactions with stakeholders and as a research team because of COVID-19. This also had an impact on bringing stakeholders together at a face-to-face event at the end of the project. Studies focusing on the prevention of urinary tract infection in care home settings were predominantly from the USA and Europe where the regulatory and funding systems for the long-term care of the elderly have some differences, particularly in the USA where national reporting plays a significant role in driving improvements in care. Care home staff have a vital role in the prevention and recognition of urinary tract infection, which can be enabled through integration and prioritisation within the systems and routines of care homes and delivery of person-centred care. Promoting fundamental care as a means of facilitating a holistic approach to prevention and recognition of urinary tract infection helps staff to recognise how they can contribute to antimicrobial stewardship and recognition of sepsis. Challenging assumptions made by staff about the presentation of urinary tract infection is complex and requires education that facilitates 'unlearning' and questioning of low-value practices. Programmes to prevent urinary tract infection need to be co-designed and supported through active and visible leadership by care home managers with support from specialist practitioners. We will focus on co-designing tools that facilitate implementation of our findings to ensure they fit with the care home context and address some of the challenges faced by care home leaders. This will underpin action at care home and system levels. Further research is needed to better understand the perspectives of residents and family carers, the effectiveness of non-pharmacological, pharmacological and specialist practitioner interventions and non-traditional approaches to training and educating the workforce in care home settings. This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42020201782. This award was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme (NIHR award ref: NIHR130396) and is published in full in  This study was about how interventions to prevent and recognise urinary tract infections might work in care homes to reduce urinary tract infection in older people. We used an approach called realist synthesis. This aims to understand everything that influences how care is delivered to find out what works in particular situations and settings. We did this by talking to care home staff, residents, family carers and other experts about how to reduce urinary tract infection in older people living in care homes. We combined their experiences and ideas with the evidence from the research literature. From this, we developed three areas of focus: care approaches to support accurate recognition of urinary tract infection care approaches to prevent urinary tract infection/catheter-associated urinary tract infection making best practice happen. Our research shows that care staff are best placed to recognise subtle changes in a resident\u2019s behaviour or well-being which might indicate an infection. There are several things care staff can do to proactively help residents from developing a urinary tract infection such as prioritising residents\u2019 hydration needs and addressing poor fluid intake. Putting in place infection prevention measures such as caring for, or where possible, removing a urinary catheter can also help. Actively monitoring residents to determine reasons for changes in behaviour can increase the focus on preventative activities and help avoid inappropriate treatment. The detection and prevention of urinary tract infection in older people could be improved in several ways, including: education tailored to the roles and work of care home staff leaders of care homes providing a culture of safety and improvement where urinary tract infection is recognised as something preventable rather than unavoidable having a safe and supportive environment where staff are confident to communicate their concerns all care team members, residents and their families and other professionals linked with the home having a common language and shared goals in the recognition, prevention and diagnosis of urinary tract infection. The COVID-19 pandemic required us to adapt our approach and work mainly online both in our interactions with stakeholders and as a research team. While this provided opportunities to extend our reach to a wider group of stakeholders, it also limited some of our engagement work.",

Retrospective cohort study. Three inpatient oncology services including patients with solid tumor malignancies in an academic cancer center. Hospitalized adults with oncologic malignancies receive antimicrobials for any indication. We reviewed all patients receiving antimicrobials on inpatient oncology services who were included in IPPAF and prospectively documented clinical syndromes represented, most common recommendations, and acceptance rate. We also examined the standardized antimicrobial administration ratio (SAAR) for oncology units over the study period. Over 34 weeks, we performed 154 interventions for 138 patients. Metastatic malignancy was common (52%) and 90-day mortality was high (43%). Diagnostic uncertainty was common (33/154, 21%), as were cases of intra-abdominal pathology (30/154, 19%), pneumonia (25/154, 16%), and urinary tract infection (12/154, 8%). The most common recommendations were changes in duration (63/154, 41%) and stopping antimicrobials for syndromes determined to be noninfectious (29/154, 19%). Acceptance of interventions was high (77% overall) and several SAARs on the primary oncology unit significantly decreased after starting IPPAF. We identified numerous opportunities for antimicrobial optimization among solid tumor malignancy patients. Most clinical syndromes were ones also encountered frequently in non-oncology populations, but several were unique and represented opportunities for targeted education.",

    "abstract": "There is an urgent need to understand the implementation barriers of antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASPs) in low- and middle-income countries. We conducted a mixed-methods study in public and private hospitals across all provinces in Indonesia (March-December 2023). We used a self-assessment questionnaire with a scoring system, and multi-level ordinal regression to assess associations with hospital and district-level characteristics. Focus group discussions (FGDs) with hospital stakeholders examined barriers and enablers. We applied a patient safety framework to integrate results. A total of 575 (19%) of 3026 hospitals completed the self-assessment, of whom 516 (89.7%) had a formal ASP (median 4 (interquartile range (IQR) 1-5] years), and 14 participated in FGD. The median overall ASP development score was 48.4% (35.9-62.5%), classifying 41 (8.0%) hospitals as inadequate (0-25%), 237 (45.9%) as basic (26-50%), 179 (34.7%) as intermediate (51-75%) and 59 (11.4%) as advanced (76-100%). Scores were highest for hospital leadership support (83.4% (IQR 66.7-100%)), followed by ASP team and infectious disease training (66.7% (IQR 55.6-77.8%)); education (50% (IQR 0.0-75.0%)); ASP interventions (43.8% (IQR 18.7-68.7%)); hospital infrastructure (42.9% (IQR 14.3-71.4%)); and monitoring, reporting and feedback (40.9% (IQR 27.3-54.5%)). A higher ASP development score was associated with higher hospital tiered level, longer ASP duration, and higher district-level Public Health Development Index and per capita domestic expenditure, but not with hospital ownership or geographic region. FGDs highlighted barriers related to hospital leadership support, staff technical and behavioural skills, cross-disciplinary collaboration, fear of loss of prescriber autonomy, microbiology and IT support, and hospital accreditation. Identified implementation barriers can inform actions for context-specific, sustainable improvement of ASPs.",

    "abstract": "We previously performed a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) in general practices and older adult care organizations in Poland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. We found that a multifaceted antibiotic stewardship intervention (ASI) substantially reduced antibiotic use for suspected urinary tract infections (UTIs) in frail older adults compared with usual care. We aimed to evaluate the implementation process of the ASI to provide recommendations for clinical practice. We conducted a process evaluation alongside the cluster RCT. The ASI consisted of a decision-tool and a toolbox, which were implemented using a participatory-action-research (PAR) approach with sessions for education and evaluation. We documented the implementation process of the intervention and administered a questionnaire to health care professionals (HCPs) from participating organizations in the intervention and usual care clusters. We evaluated the multiple components of the intervention and its implementation following a structured framework. The questionnaire was completed by 254 HCPs from the 38 participating clusters. All components were largely delivered according to plan and evaluated as useful. The decision-tool and toolbox materials were reported to facilitate decision-making on UTIs. Regarding the PAR approach, educational sessions focusing on the distinction between UTIs and asymptomatic bacteriuria were held in all 19 intervention clusters. In 17 out of these 19 clusters, evaluation sessions took place, which were reported to help remind HCPs to implement the ASI. During both sessions, HCPs valued the reflection that took place and the resulting awareness of their behavior. It allowed them to explore implementation barriers and to tailor their local implementation process to overcome these. For example, HCPs organized extra educational sessions or revised local policies to incorporate the use of the decision-tool. Various HCPs took key roles in implementation. Staff changes and the COVID-19 pandemic were important contextual barriers. We found each component of the multifaceted ASI and its implementation to have added value in the process to improve antibiotic prescribing for suspected UTIs in a heterogeneous older adult care setting. We recommend using a multifaceted, multidisciplinary approach that enables HCPs to reflect on their current practice and accordingly tailor local implementation. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03970356.

    "abstract": "In Switzerland and other high-income countries, one out of 3000 to 5000 term and late preterm neonates develops early onset sepsis (EOS) associated with a mortality of around 3%, while incidence and mortality of EOS in very preterm infants are substantially higher. Exposure to antibiotics for suspected EOS is disproportionally high compared to the incidence of EOS with consequences for future health and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). A safe reduction of unnecessary antibiotic treatment has to be a major goal of new management strategies and guidelines. Antibiotics should be administered immediately in situations with clinical signs of septic shock. Group B streptococcus (GBS) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) are the leading pathogens of EOS. Amoxicillin combined with an aminoglycoside remains the first choice for empirical treatment. Serial physical examinations are recommended for all neonates with risk factors for EOS. Neonates without any clinical signs suggestive of EOS should not be treated with antibiotics. In Switzerland, we do not recommend the use of the EOS calculator, a risk stratification tool, due to its unclear impact in a population with an observed antibiotic exposure below 3%. Not all neonates with respiratory distress should be empirically treated with antibiotics. Isolated tachypnea or respiratory distress starting immediately after delivery by elective caesarean section or a clearly assessed alternative explanation than EOS for clinical signs may point towards a low probability of sepsis. On the other hand, unexplained prematurity with risk factors has an inherent higher risk of EOS. Before the start of antibiotic therapy, blood cultures should be drawn with a minimum volume of 1\u00a0ml in a single aerobic blood culture bottle. This standard procedure allows antibiotics to be stopped after 24 to 36\u00a0h if no pathogen is detected in blood cultures. Current data do not support the use of PCR-based pathogen detection in blood as a standard method. Lumbar puncture is recommended in blood culture-proven EOS, critical illness, or in the presence of neurological symptoms such as seizures or altered consciousness. The accuracy of a single biomarker measurement to distinguish inflammation from infection is low in neonates. Therefore, biomarker guidance is not a standard part of decision-making regarding the start or stop of antibiotic therapy but may be used as part of an algorithm and after appropriate education of health care teams. Every newborn started on antibiotics should be assessed for organ dysfunction with prompt initiation of respiratory and hemodynamic support if needed. An elevated lactate may be a sign of poor perfusion and requires a comprehensive assessment of the clinical condition. Interventions to restore perfusion include fluid boli with crystalloids and catecholamines. Neonates in critical condition should be cared for in a specialized unit. In situations with a low probability of EOS, antibiotics should be stopped as early as possible within the first 24\u00a0h after the start of therapy. In cases with microbiologically proven EOS, reassessment and streamlining of antibiotic therapy in neonates is an important step to minimize AMR. \u00a0This guideline, developed through a critical review of the literature, facilitates a probability-based approach to the management of neonates at risk of early onset sepsis. \u2022 Neonatal exposure to antibiotics is disproportionally high compared with the incidence of early onset sepsis with implications for future health and antimicrobial resistance. \u2022 A probability-based approach may facilitate a more balanced management of neonatal sepsis and antibiotic\u00a0stewardship.",

    "abstract": "Nosocomial infections and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) stand as formidable healthcare challenges on a global scale. To address these issues, various infection control protocols and personalized treatment strategies, guided by laboratory tests, aim to detect bloodstream infections (BSI) and assess the potential for AMR. In this study, we introduce a machine learning (ML) approach based on Multi-Objective Symbolic Regression (MOSR), an evolutionary approach to create ML models in the form of readable mathematical equations in a multi-objective way to overcome the limitation of standard single-objective approaches. This method leverages readily available clinical data collected upon admission to intensive care units, with the goal of predicting the presence of BSI and AMR. We further assess its performance by comparing it to established ML algorithms using both naturally imbalanced real-world data and data that has been balanced through oversampling techniques. Our findings reveal that traditional ML models exhibit subpar performance across all training scenarios. In contrast, MOSR, specifically configured to minimize false negatives by optimizing also for the F1-Score, outperforms other ML algorithms and consistently delivers reliable results, irrespective of the training set balance with F1-Score.22 and.28 higher than any other alternative. This research signifies a promising path forward in enhancing Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) strategies. Notably, the MOSR approach can be readily implemented on a large scale, offering a new ML tool to find solutions to these critical healthcare issues affected by limited data availability.",

    "abstract": "Upper respiratory tract infections are a prevalent cause of morbidity in children, often managed in primary care settings. These infections are predominantly viral, but antibiotics are sometimes inappropriately prescribed. This misuse, driven by parental pressure and misconceptions, contributes to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. The impact of parental awareness on antibiotic use practices is significant, as gaps in knowledge can lead to inappropriate use. This study used a cross-sectional design to assess parents' awareness of antibiotic use for upper respiratory tract infections in children in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. Data were collected via a self-administered online questionnaire distributed through social media platforms. Participants were parents aged 18 years and older residing in Jazan. A snowball sampling technique was employed. The questionnaire assessed knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding antibiotics. The study included 398 participants, with a nearly equal gender distribution of 198 females (49.7%) and 200 males (50.3%). Participants' ages were as follows: 148 (37.2%) were 18-30 years old, 162 (40.7%) were 31-40 years old, and 88 (22.1%) were over 40 years old. Regarding educational attainment, 29 (7.3%) mothers and 36 (9.0%) fathers had primary school education; 117 (29.4%) mothers and 128 (32.2%) fathers had secondary school education; 22 (5.5%) mothers and 33 (8.3%) fathers had intermediate school education; 209 (52.5%) mothers and 175 (44.0%) fathers held a bachelor's degree; and 21 (5.3%) mothers and 26 (6.5%) fathers had a master's degree. Most participants had a moderate income level (270, 67.8%) and resided in Bish (202, 50.8%). The main sources of information about antibiotics were doctors (242, 60.8%) and the internet (90, 22.6%). Perceptions varied, with 147 (36.9%) agreeing and 84 (21.1%) strongly agreeing that antibiotics can prevent complications from infections. A significant proportion believed that inappropriate use could lead to antibiotic resistance (172, 43.2% agreed; 129, 32.4% strongly agreed). Regarding the use of leftover antibiotics, 197 (49.5%) disagreed with using them without consulting a doctor. Interaction with pediatricians showed that 212 (53.3%) always followed pediatrician advice and instructions, while 66 (16.6%) rarely did. The study highlights significant gaps in parental awareness regarding antibiotic use for upper respiratory tract infections in Jazan. Despite some understanding of antibiotic resistance, misconceptions about the efficacy and appropriate use of antibiotics persist. Addressing these gaps through targeted education and improving communication with healthcare providers could enhance antibiotic stewardship and reduce the risk of resistance.",

The review of 28 studies identified by systematic searches of electronic databases improves our understanding of the current state and will help guide the design and implementation of strategies to improve widespread POCT adoption. To effectively implement respiratory POCT in primary care, it is crucial to address several key challenges. These include ensuring the availability of resources to alleviate time pressures and costs, enhancing training, increasing quality control, improving device feasibility, and managing patient expectations. In doing so, diagnostic POCTs can contribute to an accurate, rapid, and evidence-based diagnosis of RTIs to reduce antimicrobial use and improve antimicrobial stewardship and patient outcomes.",

The implementation of computerized clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) offers new opportunities for semiautomated antimicrobial review by AMS teams. This study aimed to evaluate the perceived facilitators, barriers and benefits of end-users related to a commercial CDSS recently implemented in a hospital and to assess its usability. A mixed-method approach was used among AMS team members nine months after the implementation of the CDSS in a university hospital in northeastern France. A qualitative analysis based on individual semistructured interviews was conducted to collect end-users' perceptions. A quantitative analysis was performed using the System Usability Scale (SUS). Eleven AMS team members agreed to participate. The qualitative analysis revealed technical, organizational and human barriers and facilitators of CDSS implementation. Effective collaboration with information technology teams was crucial for ensuring the installation and configuration of the software. CDSS adoption by the AMS team required time, human resources, training, adaptation and a clinical leader. Moreover, the CDSS had to be well designed, user-friendly and provide benefits to AMS activities. The quantitative analysis indicated that the CDSS was a \"good\" system in terms of perceived ease of use (median SUS score: 77.5/100). This study shows the value of the studied CDSS to support AMS activities. It reveals barriers, facilitators and benefits to the implementation and adoption of the CDSS. These barriers and facilitators could be considered to facilitate the implementation of the software in other hospitals.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is a significant threat to global health. Antimicrobial stewardship is reducing inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing to counter it. Dentists prescribe ~10% of all antibiotics worldwide, yet up to 90% of antibiotic prescriptions by dentists are inappropriate. The aim of this systematic review was to update a 2017 review evaluating the effects of antibiotic stewardship interventions in dental settings, using the international consensus on core outcomes for dental antibiotic stewardship. Systematic database searches were undertaken in April 2023, of the: Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE via OVID, EMBASE via OVID, Dentistry and Oral Sciences Source, the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register, the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the ISRCTN registry databases. Randomised controlled trials (or non-randomised studies with clearly reported mechanism of group formation and inclusion criteria) of interventions to optimise and/or reduce dental antibiotic prescribing were eligible for inclusion. Two authors independently screened for eligible studies. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool, certainty of evidence assessed using GRADE. Meta-analysis was planned whether the results of studies reported similar outcomes, otherwise narrative synthesis was undertaken. Three eligible studies randomising 2148 participants were included. The interventions were combinations of education, audit and feedback and written behaviour change messages, guideline summary, practice visits and patient leaflets. None of the control groups received an intervention. All three included studies measured the quantity of antibiotics prescribed and two measured the appropriateness of prescribing. None measured patient-reported or adverse outcomes. Two included studies were assessed as 'high risk' and one with 'low risk' of bias. There was high-certainty evidence that audit and personalised feedback with individualised behaviour change messages can be effective. Evidence for in-person education was low-certainty. Guideline dissemination alone was ineffective at improving antibiotic prescribing. Due to different outcomes reported, meta-analysis was inappropriate. Although various dental antibiotic stewardship interventions have been reported in the literature, only three have been evaluated using a randomised design, of which only one provided high certainty evidence. To strengthen the body of evidence, well-powered, robust, randomised controlled trials are required, with adequate follow-up, reporting the internationally-agreed core outcomes and including a parallel process evaluation is recommended.

In Zambia, there is little information regarding the capacity of hospitals to establish and implement AMS programs. The objective of this study was to conduct a baseline assessment of WHO core elements for an AMS program implementation in eight hospitals in Zambia. We conducted an exploratory cross-sectional study from September 2023 to December 2023 using a self-scoring Periodic National and Healthcare Facility Assessment Tool from the World Health Organization (WHO) policy guidance on integrated AMS activities in human health. Eight public hospitals were surveyed across the five provinces of Zambia. Data was analyzed using the WHO self-scoring tool and thematic analysis. Overall, 62.5% (6/8) of the facilities scored low (below 60%) in implementing AMS programs. Most facilities had challenges with reporting AMS feedback within the hospital (average score\u2009=\u200946%), Drugs and Therapeutics Committee (DTC) functionality (average score\u2009=\u200949%), AMS actions (average score\u2009=\u200950%), education and training (average score\u2009=\u200954%), and leadership commitment to AMS activities (average score\u2009=\u200956%). The overall score for all AMS core elements was average (56%). All the hospitals (100%) did not have an allocated budget for AMS programs. Finally, there were neither antibiograms to guide antimicrobial utilization nor AMS-trained staff in more than 50% of the hospitals surveyed. This study found low AMS implementation in these public hospitals, especially where DTCs were non-functional. The identified challenges and gaps require urgent attention for sustainable multidisciplinary AMS programs.",

    "abstract": "Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmingly affected healthcare systems, particularly in the area of antibiotic management. The surge in antimicrobial use to address secondary bacterial infections in COVID-19 patients has heightened concerns about overuse and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This study examined the pandemic's effect on the antibiotic stewardship program (ASP) at two general hospitals in Abu Dhabi, focusing on changes in prescribing practices, adherence to stewardship guidelines, resistance trends, and overall health system impact. The present retrospective study evaluated shifts in antibiotic consumption, compliance with stewardship practices, and broader healthcare implications. The aim is to assess the pandemic's impact, identify improvement areas, and provide insights to enhance the ASP in addressing the global AMR crisis. Methods This retrospective review assessed electronic medical records from two general hospitals in Abu Dhabi over a 24-month period, from January 2019 to December 2020. It included pre-COVID-19 data from 2019 and data from 2020 during the COVID-19 surge. The study focused on patients aged 25 to 40 years with respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and nosocomial infections, identified using predefined ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes. Patients with COVID-19 diagnoses and those undergoing surgical procedures were excluded. Key metrics compared data from 2019 and 2020 to assess changes in clinicians' prescribing practices, antibiotic usage, ASP interventions, and their impact on the healthcare system. Results The COVID-19 pandemic influenced antibiotic use and resistance trends, leading to longer hospital stays (3.86 days in 2019 vs. 4.29 days in 2020) and increased use of duplicate anaerobic therapy (4.58% in 2019 vs. 5.71%\u00a0in 2020). From 2019 to 2020, the average duration of antibiotic therapy decreased from 6.23 days to 5.24 days, but empirical therapy without sufficient evidence rose. The average length of treatment increased (2.87 days in 2019 vs. 3.28 days in 2020), and there was a rise in the use of antibiotics for viral and fungal infections, with cases growing from 17.08%\u00a0in 2019 to 22.38%\u00a0in 2020. Despite modest improvements in stewardship practices in 2020, AMR challenges persisted. These results underscore the need for enhanced stewardship programs and continued research to address the ongoing impact\u00a0on antibiotic prescribing and resistance. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic increased antibiotic use and altered resistance patterns. Although stewardship practices improved, AMR challenges remained. Enhanced stewardship programs and ongoing research are essential to mitigate these effects and improve antibiotic management. Recommendation To address changes in antibiotic use and resistance during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is recommended to strengthen ASPs to adapt to new prescribing trends, ensure adherence to evidence-based practices, provide ongoing education for clinicians, invest in research on long-term resistance impacts, and enhance data tracking and monitoring systems.",

We conducted a non-randomised before-and-after feasibility trial, implementing ePAMS+\u2009in two English hospitals using the Cerner Millennium EPMA system. Wards of several specialties were included. Patient participants were blinded to whether ePAMS+\u2009was in use; prescribers were not. A mixed-methods evaluation aimed to establish: acceptability and usability of ePAMS+\u2009and trial processes; feasibility of ePAMS+\u2009implementation and quantitative outcome recording; and a Fidelity Index measuring the extent to which ePAMS+\u2009was delivered as intended. Longitudinal semi-structured interviews of doctors, nurses and pharmacists, alongside non-participant observations, gathered qualitative data; we extracted quantitative prescribing data from the EPMA system. Normal linear modelling of the defined daily dose (DDD) of antibiotic per admission quantified its variability, to inform sample size calculations for a future trial of ePAMS+\u2009effectiveness. The research took place during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, from April 2021 to November 2022. 60 qualitative interviews were conducted (33 before ePAMS+\u2009implementation, 27 after). 1,958 admissions (1,358 before ePAMS+\u2009implementation; 600 after) included 24,884 antibiotic orders. Qualitative interviews confirmed that some aspects of ePAMS+\u2009, its implementation and training were acceptable, while other features (e.g. enabling combinations of antibiotics to be prescribed) required further development. ePAMS+\u2009uptake was low (28 antibiotic review records from 600 admissions; 0.047 records per admission), preventing full development of a Fidelity Index. Normal linear modelling of antibiotic DDD per admission showed a residual variance of 1.086 (log-transformed scale). Unavailability of indication data prevented measurement of some outcomes (e.g. number of antibiotic courses per indication). This feasibility trial encountered unforeseen circumstances due to contextual factors and a global pandemic, highlighting the need for careful adaptation of complex intervention implementations to the local setting. We identified key refinements to ePAMS+\u2009to support its wider adoption in clinical practice, requiring further piloting before a confirmatory effectiveness trial.

Notable diversity in implementation approaches has been observed among ID fellowship programs using the curriculum. We sought to describe individual approaches and develop a curriculum implementation roadmap. We surveyed ID fellowship programs that had previously implemented the IDSA Core AS curriculum. The survey included questions regarding program characteristics, curriculum participants and presentation format, resources and barriers, and implementation strategies. Commonly reported program features were summarized in the context of the self-reported implementation strategies. Implementation guides were developed based on the most common characteristics observed. Of 159 programs that had purchased the curriculum, 37 responded, and 34 (21%) were included in the analysis. The curriculum was primarily taught by AS physicians (85%) and AS pharmacists (47%). The most common conference structure was a longitudinal conference series (32%), and eLearning was the most common presentation format. Limited AS faculty time (76%) and limited first-year fellow availability (62%) were frequently reported as barriers, and dedicated AS curricular time was a resource available to most programs (67%); implementation guides were created for these 3 program features. Programs reported a variety of implementation barriers and resources, with several common themes emerging, allowing for the development of tailored curriculum planners for 3 commonly observed program characteristics. This work will equip fellowship programs with curriculum implementation strategies and guide future enhancements of the IDSA Core and Advanced AS curricula.",

    "abstract": "Dentists, as prominent prescribers, are key stakeholders in addressing the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) crisis. Dental students' perceptions about the topic have been underexplored in the Asia-Pacific region, a key location for the development and spread of AMR. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the awareness and confidence to prescribe antimicrobials amongst dental students studying in the region. Students from 15 dental schools in 4 countries were invited to participate in a cross-sectional online survey during 2022-2023. A previously validated and standardised 14-item instrument was utilised. In all, 1413 responses were collected from Australia (n = 165), Sri Lanka (n = 112), Japan (n = 173), and Vietnam (n = 963). Of those, 201 were from final-year students (14.2%). On a scale from 1 to 10, awareness on AMR was placed at a mean (SEM) priority of 8.09 (0.05). With regards to target areas to address for mitigation of the AMR crisis, participants placed general public awareness at the top (mean [SEM] 8.53 [0.05]). Final-year students presented a mean (SEM) level of confidence to prescribe antibiotics of 6.01 (0.14) on a scale from 1 to 10, whilst 59.7% and 56.8% indicated feeling pressured to prescribe by patients or when lacking time, respectively. Final-year students participating in research activities assigned a higher priority to AMR compared to their peers not involved in research (mean [SEM] 8.6 [0.19] vs 7.81 [0.16]; P = .01). This study highlights a need for increased awareness and confidence to prescribe amongst dental students in the Asia-Pacific region, an understudied population thus far. To mitigate this issue, the implementation (followed by assessment) of local educational and antibiotic stewardship initiatives is warranted.",

    "abstract": "A nationwide survey conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and the Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases in 2020 provided insights into antimicrobial prescription practices among clinic doctors. This study aimed to investigate factors influencing changes in antimicrobial prescriptions post-implementation of the National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (NAPAR) and doctors' inclination to prescribe antimicrobials for common cold cases. In September 2020, randomly selected questionnaires were distributed to 3000 community-based medical clinics in Japan. The primary objective was to assess the reduction in antimicrobial prescriptions post-NAPAR implementation. Multivariate linear regression analysis was employed to identify associated factors. Analysis of 632 responses (response rate: 21.1\u00a0%) revealed determinants of decreased antimicrobial prescriptions, including familiarity with the Guide to Antimicrobial Stewardship (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0.482, t\u00a0=\u00a03.177, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and awareness of NAPAR (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0.270, t\u00a0=\u00a02.301, p\u00a0=\u00a00.022). Interventions such as the Guide to Antimicrobial Stewardship may have contributed to the reduction in antimicrobial prescriptions among Japanese physicians. However, targeted strategies are needed to address high-prescription groups. Enhancing awareness and education on appropriate antimicrobial use should be integral components of future initiatives to combat antimicrobial resistance effectively.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to better understand caregiver perspectives on educational materials relating to paediatric community-acquired pneumonia and antibiotic stewardship in the emergency department setting. This was a phenomenologically informed qualitative study. Caregivers of young children in Hamilton, Ontario were presented with four educational materials (animated video, physician led lecture-style video, caregiver led testimony-style video, and a printed brochure) providing information relating to treatment strategies for community-acquired pneumonia. Caregivers were then asked open-ended questions about how they felt about the effectiveness of the media used. The principles of conventional content analysis guided the coding and synthesis of the transcribed interviews. Eleven caregivers were interviewed. Most caregivers preferred the animated video and brochure to the lecture-style physician video and caregiver testimonial video. Common themes for effective educational materials included visually attention-grabbing graphics, accessible language, and formats they could reference following their visit (e.g. brochure). The busy nature of the emergency department setting can impede effective communication between clinicians and parents. Employing educational materials may allow for more informed parent-provider communication on care decision making. Caregivers in our study prioritized the simplest information formats for education around community-acquired pneumonia and antimicrobial stewardship which could be referenced following discharge. This was best accomplished by short, animated videos and brochures. Results from this study can inform development of future educational materials used in paediatric emergency department settings to optimize caregiver education and corresponding care plan adherence. R\u00e9SUM\u00e9: OBJECTIFS: L\u2019objectif de cette \u00e9tude \u00e9tait de mieux comprendre les perspectives des soignants sur le mat\u00e9riel \u00e9ducatif relatif \u00e0 la pneumonie acquise dans la communaut\u00e9 p\u00e9diatrique et \u00e0 la g\u00e9rance des antibiotiques dans le milieu du service d\u2019urgence. M\u00e9THODES: Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une \u00e9tude qualitative \u00e0 base de donn\u00e9es ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nologiques. Les aidants naturels de jeunes enfants \u00e0 Hamilton, en Ontario, ont re\u00e7u quatre documents \u00e9ducatifs (vid\u00e9o anim\u00e9e, vid\u00e9o de pr\u00e9sentation par le m\u00e9decin, vid\u00e9o de t\u00e9moignage par le soignant et brochure imprim\u00e9e) qui fournissent des renseignements sur les strat\u00e9gies de traitement pour la communaut\u00e9 pneumonie acquise. On a ensuite pos\u00e9 aux aidants des questions ouvertes sur leur opinion au sujet de l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du m\u00e9dia utilis\u00e9. Les principes de l\u2019analyse conventionnelle du contenu ont guid\u00e9 le codage et la synth\u00e8se des entrevues transcrites. R\u00e9SULTATS: Onze aidants naturels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9s. La plupart des aidants pr\u00e9f\u00e8rent la vid\u00e9o anim\u00e9e et la brochure \u00e0 la vid\u00e9o de pr\u00e9sentation du m\u00e9decin et \u00e0 la vid\u00e9o de t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019aidant.

CONCLUSIONS: La nature occup\u00e9e du service d\u2019urgence peut entraver une communication efficace entre les cliniciens et les parents. L\u2019utilisation de mat\u00e9riel \u00e9ducatif peut permettre une communication plus \u00e9clair\u00e9e entre les parents et le fournisseur de soins sur la prise de d\u00e9cisions en mati\u00e8re de soins.

This continuing education activity is intended for physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and registered nurses with an interest in skin and wound care. After participating in this educational activity, the participant will:1. Explain the mechanisms underlying chronic wound physiology and their implications for effective wound healing and management.2. Evaluate the role of therapeutic index values for topical antiseptics in chronic wound management.3. Apply evidence-based treatment strategies for chronic wound management. Chronic wounds place a heavy burden on healthcare systems and reduce patients\u2019 activities of daily living. Increased bacterial bioburden (local infection, covert infection) impairs wound healing. With increased antimicrobial resistance, alternative antimicrobial strategies are important. To determine the topical antiseptic therapeutic index values for common wound bacterial species. The therapeutic index is a ratio comparing lowest concentration that causes mammalian cell cytotoxicity to the minimum bactericidal concentration; higher values indicate greater safety / clinical benefit. MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched from conception to June 2023. Common wound bacterial species and their in-vitro minimum bactericidal concentrations were compared to the minimum mammalian cell cytotoxicity concentration. The authors identified 37 qualifying articles. Antiseptic, bacterial organism, mammalian cell type, minimum bactericidal concentration, and mammalian cell cytotoxicity concentration values. The therapeutic indices for the topical antiseptics were generally low, with most ranging between 0.5 and 3.0. The highest therapeutic index values for Escherichia coli (5.49), Staphylococcus aureus (6.31) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.81) were achieved by hypochlorous acid. The highest therapeutic index value for methicillin resistant S aureus (12.1) was achieved by polyhexamethylene biguanide. Antibiotic stewardship principles need to be applied to topical antiseptics due to some isolated topical antiseptic resistance and cross-resistance to oral antimicrobials. The choice of antiseptic should not be made solely based on therapeutic index values but individualized with the wound healing condition including covert infection.",

    "abstract": "Local operative treatments are generally preferred for most dental diseases, with antibiotics only recommended as an adjunct in specific cases. Misuse and overuse of antibiotics has been shown to significantly contribute to the development of resistant bacteria. However, the antibiotic prescribing practices of dentists in Ethiopia have not been thoroughly studied. This study aimed to assess the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing for patients with dental diseases at dental clinics in Mekelle City, Northern Ethiopia. A cross sectional study was conducted in April and May 2020 among patients visiting dental clinics in Mekelle City. Data were collected through patient medical record reviews and dentist interviews. The appropriateness of antibiotic prescription was evaluated based on guidelines from the American Dental Association and the European Society of Endodontology. Data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics, version 29. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed, and the results were presented as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Two hundred and thirty-one patients with dental diseases participated in the study. The mean age was 30.6 years with a standard deviation of 16.1. Most participants had dental pulp related disease. 89% of patients were prescribed antibiotics, with amoxicillin being the most common. Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing was identified in 175 (75.8%) of the study participants. The most common inappropriate prescribing was unnecessary antibiotic prescribing for dental conditions without systemic signs, assessed in 141 (80.1%) participants. Patients diagnosed with pulp related disease without systemic signs and those who had tooth extractions were significantly associated with inappropriate antibiotic prescription (p value\u2009<\u20090.001). The study findings show that antibiotics are over-prescribed for dental conditions in this resource constrained setting, especially in patients who have had tooth extractions. Dentists need training on appropriate antibiotic use and antimicrobial stewardship interventions should be implemented in dental setting to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions and prevent antibiotic resistance development.",

Educational programs targeting veterinary students can play a significant role in shaping their knowledge and attitudes toward antimicrobial use and stewardship. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of educational programs on the knowledge and attitudes regarding AMS among veterinary students in Serbia. A structured educational program on AMS was implemented for veterinary students at the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Novi Sad. Pre- and post-symposium assessments were conducted to measure changes in students' knowledge and attitudes. The study employed a mixed-methods approach, including surveys and focus groups, to gather quantitative and qualitative data. The study resulted in significant short-term improvements in students' knowledge of AMS principles and their attitudes toward responsible antimicrobial use. Participants demonstrated a better understanding of the mechanisms of resistance and the importance of adhering to stewardship guidelines. Qualitative feedback indicated increased awareness of the consequences of inappropriate antimicrobial use and a stronger commitment to applying stewardship practices in their future careers. The educational programs effectively enhanced immediate veterinary students' knowledge and attitudes regarding AMS.

    "abstract": "In China's expanding dairy industry, a lack of oversight regarding antimicrobial use and increasing antimicrobial resistance are evident. Selective treatments of dairy cows for clinical mastitis or dry cow therapy are proposed to promote judicious antimicrobial use without adversely impacting cattle health. These approaches have been successfully implemented on farms in other countries. On 28 October 2023, a 2-day in-person seminar was held in Beijing, China, on selective antimicrobial treatments of dairy cows for clinical mastitis or dry cow therapy on large Chinese dairy farms. Concurrently, a qualitative study involving 15 technical managers from the 13 largest Chinese dairy groups used focus group discussions and questionnaires to explore perspectives on selective treatments of dairy cows for clinical mastitis or dry cow therapy. The main outcomes assessed were opinions and concerns regarding implementing selective antimicrobial treatments. Although there was diversity of cognition on AMR and selective treatments, the technical managers were generally positive regarding adoption of selective treatments. However, they expressed a need for more evidence and tools, including anticipated economic impacts, effects of delaying treatment until diagnosis, accurate interpretation of milk recording data, safe use of internal teat sealants, and spread of pathogens. Participants stressed the need for awareness, staff training, farm management, and China-specific standards, suggesting large-scale trials to assess efficacy of selective treatments. The findings revealed key challenges and barriers currently impeding selective AMU practices. These insights could inform efforts to promote judicious AMU on farms through targeted treatment regimens, reducing mounting selective pressure driving resistance.",

This study aims to assess and compare central European CAUTIs regarding diagnostics, treatment, and prophylaxis. An anonymized online questionnaire was distributed among urologists in Austria, France, Germany, and Switzerland between January and October 2023, consisting of demographic questions on catheter management and diagnostics, treatment, and prophylaxis of CAUTIs. An analysis was performed per country. Comparisons were done with the Fisher's exact test (statistical significance with  Out of 423 participating urologists, most regularly performed catheter changes and managed catheter-related issues, except for French urologists. Swiss urologists tended to change the catheter after a longer interval. In France, a higher estimated number of CAUTIs were observed. Diagnostic symptoms and measures varied significantly between countries. French urologists prescribed more antimicrobials per patient and administered longer treatment regimens. The choice of antimicrobial agents differed notably for nonfebrile and febrile CAUTIs, with cotrimoxazole/nitrofurantoin being common for nonfebrile cases and cephalosporin/amoxicillin for febrile ones. Follow-up protocols were similar among urologists, while prophylactic measures showed variations. CAUTI management varied notably across countries in terms of diagnostics, treatment, and prophylaxis. Discrepancies in antimicrobial therapy could be influenced by local resistance rates; yet, nonrecommended drugs and prolonged regimens, as compared with guideline recommendations, were common. This trend, along with inappropriate diagnostics and prophylaxis, may increase antimicrobial resistance and CAUTI morbidity. This study emphasizes the necessity for diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship interventions, and proper training in CAUTI management. In this questionnaire-based study examining the clinical practices for managing urinary tract infections in patients with bladder catheters (CAUTIs), significant disparities were observed among European urologists regarding diagnosis, treatment, and prophylaxis. These findings underscore the critical need for clear guidelines and comprehensive training in CAUTI management.",

    "abstract": "The reported estimates of bacterial co-infection in COVID-19 patients are highly variable. We aimed to determine the rates and risk factors of bacterial co-infection and develop a clinical prediction model to support early decision-making on antibiotic use. This is a retrospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary-level academic hospital in Israel between March 2020 and May 2022. All adult patients with severe COVID-19 who had a blood or lower respiratory specimen sent for microbiological analyses within 48 h of admission were included. The primary study endpoint was the prevalence of bacterial co-infection at the time of hospital admission. We created a prediction model using the R XGBoost package. The study cohort included 1,050 patients admitted with severe or critical COVID-19. Sixty-two patients (5.9%) had a microbiologically proven bacterial infection on admission. The variables with the greatest impact on the prediction model were age, comorbidities, functional capacity, and laboratory parameters. The model achieved perfect prediction on the training set (area under the curve = 1.0). When applied to the test dataset, the model achieved 56% and 78% specificity with the area under the receiver operating curve of 0.784. The negative and positive predictive values were 0.975 and 0.105, respectively. Applying the prediction model would have resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in appropriate antibiotic use and an 18% reduction in inappropriate use in patients with severe and critical COVID-19. The use of a clinical prediction model can support decisions to withhold empiric antimicrobial treatment at the time of hospital admission without adversely affecting patient outcomes. Estimates of bacterial coinfection in COVID-19 patients are highly variable and depend on many factors. Patients with severe or critical COVID-19 requiring intensive care unit admission have the highest risk of infection-related complications and death. Thus, the study of the incidence and risk factors for bacterial coinfection in this population is of special interest and may help guide empiric antibiotic therapy and avoid unnecessary antimicrobial treatment. The prediction model based on clinical criteria and simple laboratory tests may be a useful tool to predict bacterial co-infection in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19.",

We surveyed Black patients (33%) and Hispanic/Latine patients (47%), and over 93% expected to receive an antibiotic for at least 1 of the 5 pre-defined symptoms/illnesses. Public clinic patients were nearly twice as likely to expect antibiotics for sore throat, diarrhea, and cold/flu than private clinic patients. Lack of knowledge of potential risks of antibiotic use was associated with increased antibiotic expectations for diarrhea (odds ratio [OR] = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4) and cold/flu symptoms (OR = 2.9; 95% CI, 2.0-4.4).

Antibiotic stewardship programs (ASP) aim to optimise infection treatment and curb resistance, yet implementation hurdles persist. This study examined ASP challenges in ICUs. This study employed a qualitative methodological design to evaluate the implementation process of an antibiotic stewardship program (ASP) in eight intensive care units (ICUs) across Argentina. Thirty-four semi-structured interviews with healthcare workers (HCWs) were conducted. Interviews were analysed guided by Normalisation Process Theory, examining coherence, cognitive participation, collective action, and reflexive monitoring constructs. Key challenges included insufficient human resources, lack of institutional support, and resistance to change, particularly among staff not initially involved in the study. Despite these challenges, the program saw partial success in improving ICU practices, particularly in antibiotic use and communication across departments. The main strategy implemented in this quality improvement collaborative was the use of improvement cycles, which served as the central component for driving change. However, participation in improvement cycles was inconsistent, and sustainability post-intervention remains uncertain due to workload pressures and the need for continuous education. Concerns about workload and communication barriers persisted. Many participants did not perceive training as a separate component, which led to low engagement. Resistance to change became evident during modifications to clinical guidelines. The intervention had a positive impact on various processes, including communication and record keeping. This study underscores the persistent challenges in implementing ASPs in healthcare, emphasising the need for enhanced collaboration, workforce capacity building, and evidence-based practices to overcome barriers and optimize antimicrobial use to improve patient outcomes.",

Diversity of participants was deliberately sought. Semistructured interviews were conducted online. Two case studies were discussed, and then a range of broader questions was posed. Transcripts were analyzed thematically, using an inductive approach. Few participants chose guideline-concordant management for the case studies. Prescribing choices were influenced by a complex array of factors associated with the clinical case, pet owner, drug, veterinarian, veterinary colleagues, and external factors. Key factors driving broad-spectrum antimicrobial use included a sense of safety, habit, ease of administering the drug (especially in cats), pharmaceutical marketing, and the self-perpetuating dispensary cycle. Many participants were concerned about antimicrobial resistance, but insufficiently informed about how to minimize this risk. Several participants believed that longer duration of treatment and ensuring patients finish a predetermined course would decrease the risk of antimicrobial resistance and improve clinical outcomes. Veterinarians are engaged with the concept of antimicrobial stewardship, but face numerous practical barriers and require more information. In particular, improved education is needed on enhancing patient safety by minimizing both spectrum of activity and duration of treatment, and dispelling myths about \"finishing the course.\"",

    "abstract": "Healthcare globally is increasingly threatened by antibiotic resistance. Misunderstanding of the appropriate use of antibiotics is common within the general population, therefore patient education could be a useful tool to employ against antibiotic resistance. Patient satisfaction with healthcare is important, and antibiotic awareness is crucial to avoid disappointment when antibiotic stewardship is practiced. This review aims to identify whether patient education is an effective tool to improve knowledge and awareness of the appropriate use of antibiotics and whether it has an effect on expectations of or prescription rates of antibiotics. Embase, Medline, Web of Science, PubMed, and Cochrane Library were searched to identify studies examining the impact of various forms of patient education on awareness of appropriate antibiotic use and antibiotic prescription rates. Reference lists of eligible studies were also screened. Three hundred and fourteen unique studies were identified, of which 18 were eligible for inclusion. All studies were of good quality. Three studies examined public health campaigns, five examined leaflets, two examined posters, three examined videos, four used mixed interventions and one study examined a presentation. The results were too heterogenous to perform a meta-analysis. Patient education is an effective tool to increase public knowledge and awareness of the appropriate use of antibiotics, and can reduce the expectation of or prescription rates of antibiotics. The form of patient education matters, as interventions involving active learning and engagement demonstrate significant positive outcomes, whereas passive forms of learning do not appear to have any effect on understanding or prescriptions.",

The distribution of antibiotics in absence of a prescription in pharmacies is a significant contributor to the growing global public health crisis of antibiotic resistance. A pharmacist's clinical and lawful knowledge of antibiotic provide has an impact on the proper way to dispense medication. There are few novel studies assessing pharmacists comprehension and experience in prescribing antibiotics in low- and middle-income countries, including those in the Arabian region.

Of the 3100 pharmacists reached, 2833 completed and return the questionnaires (response rate 91.3%). Most of the respondents were male (57.4%). Aged between 19 and 31 years old (76.2%). Most of them held a B.Sc. Degree (78.5%). Worked as staff pharmacists (73.2%). During the survey, it was discovered that there were gaps in their knowledge regarding antibiotic usage. A total of 45.7% of the respondents were unaware that antibiotics can be used as prophylaxis, while 33.3% did not recognize the consequences of making incorrect antibiotic choices. Regarding their practice patterns, 53.8% of the pharmacists admitted that they did not consistently adhere to guidelines when dispensing antibiotics. In terms of attitudes toward antibiotic usage, 36.8% disagreed with the guidelines of not supply antibiotics without a prescription, suggesting some variation in opinions among pharmacists on this matter. Additionally, a significant percentage (75%) believed that community pharmacists had qualifications to prescribe antibiotics for infections. The recent survey has shed light on the differences among pharmacists in regard to dispensing antibiotics without prescriptions and their understanding of resistance. The findings are concerning, indicating a deficient in of knowledge as regards the use of antibiotics. It is crucial to implement regulations and enhance education efforts to tackle the growing problem of resistance. Collaboration between healthcare professionals and awareness campaigns is essential in addressing this issue.",

    "abstract": "The global rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is claiming the lives of more than 1.2 million people each year. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) this global health crisis is particularly acute in Africa, largely due to fragile and underfunded health systems. Efforts to combat this public health threat have led to the implementation of health system interventions worldwide aimed at managing and containing the spread of AMR. However, the literature on the real time impacts and the barriers that hinder the implementation of these interventions in the African context is limited. The objective of this scoping review was to identify AMR interventions in African health systems, their impact, and the challenges of the implementation. Drawing on Muka and colleague's 24 step approach for scoping reviews, two major public health databases (PubMed and Global Health) were searched for articles in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines resulting in 4,783 records. Screening and retrieval of articles was done using Rayyan software based on specified inclusion criteria and 36 articles included in the final list. These articles were synthesized after extracting specific data on AMR interventions and their impact on African health systems. The review identified four broad impacts of AMR interventions including 1. Reduction in antibiotics use, 2. Increased adherence to guidelines and protocols, 3. Enhanced laboratory-based AMR surveillance, 4. Development of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) Action Plans and Teams. However, challenges such as poor laboratory infrastructure, logistical challenges, poor financial commitment and inadequate education and training were identified as challenges impeding the successful implementation of AMR interventions in Africa. Our findings reveal a range of successful AMR interventions in African health systems although infrastructural and financial challenges remain. Better standardization and reporting of AMR diagnosis while leveraging the available information is needed to improve the optimization of treatment guidelines across Africa.",

    "abstract": "Despite the extensive use of antibiotics and the growing challenge of antimicrobial resistance, there has been a lack of substantial initiatives aimed at diminishing the prevalence of infections in nursing homes and enhancing the detection of urinary tract infections (UTIs). This study aims to systematize and enhance efforts to prevent health care-associated infections, mainly UTIs and reduce antibiotic inappropriateness by implementing a multifaceted intervention targeting health care professionals in nursing homes. A before-and-after intervention study carried out in a minimum of 10 nursing homes in each of the 8 European participating countries (Denmark, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain). A team of 4 professionals consisting of nurses, doctors, health care assistants, or health care helpers are actively involved in each nursing home. Over the initial 3-month period, professionals in each nursing home are registering information on UTIs as well as infection and prevention control measures by means of the Audit Project Odense method. The audit will be repeated after implementing a multifaceted intervention. The intervention will consist of feedback and discussion of the results from the first registration, training on the implementation of infection and prevention control techniques provided by experts, appropriateness of the diagnostic approach and antibiotic prescribing for UTIs, and provision of information materials on infection control and antimicrobial stewardship targeted to staff, residents, and relatives. We will compare the pre- and postintervention audit results using chi-square test for prescription appropriateness and Student t test for implemented hygiene elements. A total of 109 nursing homes have participated in the pilot study and the first registration audit. The results of the first audit registration are expected to be published in autumn of 2024. The final results will be published by the end of 2025. This is a European Union-funded project aimed at contributing to the battle against antimicrobial resistance through improvement of the quality of management of common infections based on evidence-based interventions tailored to the nursing home setting and a diverse range of professionals. We expect the intervention to result in a significant increase in the number of hygiene activities implemented by health care providers and residents. Additionally, we anticipate a marked reduction in the number of inappropriately managed UTIs, as well as a substantial decrease in the overall incidence of infections following the intervention.

    "abstract": "Antibiotics are widely used in the pediatric population, and their inappropriate use contributes to antibiotic resistance, which is a growing concern in developing countries. Therefore, this national cross-sectional study aimed to assess community pharmacists' knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding appropriate antibiotic use and dosing in pediatric patients and to explore the barriers to such use in Palestine. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted among community pharmacists on the West Bank, Palestine, from September 2022 to March 2023. The survey assessed the pharmacists' sociodemographic characteristics; knowledge, practices, and attitudes toward antibiotic use; and understanding of antibiotic dosing. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and the factors affecting pharmacists' knowledge were evaluated. The study included 301 community pharmacists, with an average age of 30.06 years, who were primarily female (75.1%). The majority of the pharmacists (80.1%) correctly believed that antibiotics are effective against bacterial infections. However, 18.3% believed that antibiotics are effective against viruses. While 61.8% knew that antibiotics kill germs, 32.0% were unaware that not all antibiotics require refrigeration. Furthermore, 67.8% were aware that antibiotics do not speed up recovery from diarrhea. Over 99% of the participants recognized that antibiotic resistance developed due to various resistant mechanisms. The majority (78.7%) believed that each infection needed a different antibiotic. Pharmacists demonstrated reasonable knowledge of antibiotic dosing in case scenarios. Knowledge was positively correlated with years of experience (P\u2009=\u20090.001). This study revealed that community pharmacy professionals have a good understanding of antibiotic usage in pediatric patients. The findings suggest that professional expertise and quality training improve healthcare services. However, the results may not be universally applicable, as identifying knowledge gaps is necessary to help with the development of focused interventions. Therefore, ongoing educational initiatives, awareness campaigns and antibiotic stewardship programs are recommended.",

However, bacterial adaptation mechanisms over time have led to increased antimicrobial resistance, necessitating judicious antibiotic use. This study aims to comprehensively analyze pharmaceutical interventions related to antibiotic prescriptions governed by antibiotic order forms to identify and rectify medication errors, optimizing antibiotic prescribing practices. Approval for this research was obtained from the institutional review board of the Main Military Training Hospital of Tunis, Tunisia. A retrospective study was conducted at the main military training hospital of Tunis over 4\u00a0months. Pharmaceutical validation of antibiotic prescriptions through antibiotic order forms was conducted by a pharmacy resident. Pharmaceutical interventions were initiated upon detection of errors, and patient records were accessed through institutional software. Out of 1100\u00a0prescription forms analyzed, 41 pharmaceutical interventions were conducted for 7\u00a0antibiotics. Twenty-four percent of all interventions were related to antibiotic order forms, with the intensive care unit accounting for the highest number of errors. Under-dosage and prescription errors were common. Our pharmaceutical interventions related to antibiotic order forms are crucial for optimizing antibiotic therapy. Feedback mechanisms to healthcare teams are essential for enhancing prescription quality and patient care outcomes. Ongoing surveillance and improvement efforts are necessary to address medication errors and enhance antimicrobial stewardship.",

However, during culture sampling, contamination can occur, resulting in misdiagnosis, unnecessary antibiotic exposure, and prolonged hospitalization. This before-and-after intervention study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a multimodal intervention in preventing blood culture contamination. The study was conducted in a 170-bed hospital in Portugal and included a total of 23,566 blood cultures. Contamination rates were assessed in two phases: Phase 1 (before intervention, month 0) included 10,928 cultures, and Phase 2 (after intervention, month 6) included 12,638 cultures. During the study period, a multimodal intervention targeting the nursing staff was implemented, consisting of training actions, guideline updates, regular data monitoring and feedback, and introduction of a blood culture pack. Following the intervention, blood culture contamination decreased from 6.8% (Phase 1) to 3.9% (Phase 2). A comparative analysis revealed that the risk of contamination before the intervention was nearly four times higher in first culture, OR = 3.97 (CI 2.86-5.49).

    "abstract": "To understand antimicrobial stewardship (AS) and infection prevention and control (IPC) activities in veterinary schools. An online survey was completed by representatives from American Association of Veterinary Medical Colleges-accredited veterinary schools in the US and Caribbean prior to attending the Inaugural Small Animal Antimicrobial Stewardship Workshop for US Veterinary Schools. Responses were examined to identify patterns among AS and IPC activities and adherence to the AVMA core principles. Half (12 of 24) of the surveyed schools had an AS committee and most (79% [19 of 24]) had an IPC committee. Lack of dedicated staff time was a common barrier to AS (88% [21 of 24]) and IPC (75% [18 of 24]) reported by schools both with and without AS and IPC committees. Eleven of 24 schools (46%) reported performing at least 1 activity focused on each of the AVMA's 5 core principles of AS. Although 79% (19 of 24) of schools incorporate AS into preclinical curricula, training of clinical faculty (17% [4 of 24]), veterinary technicians and support staff (21% [5 of 24]), and house officers (42% [10 of 24]) is less common, despite these individuals engaging in teaching clinical-year veterinary students. Veterinary schools varied in established AS education and AS and IPC practices, though financial and human resources were a common barrier. A collaborative and cohesive approach to AS and IPC among schools to create sustainable frameworks for practice improvement will help combat the global threat of antimicrobial resistance. This is a critical action for settings where future veterinarians are trained.",

    "abstract": "Findings from research and recommendations from the World Health Organization favor restrictive use of episiotomy, but whether this guidance is being followed in India, and factors associated with its use, are not known. This study sought to document trends in use of episiotomy over a five-year period (2014-2018); to examine its relationship to maternal, pregnancy, and health-system characteristics; and to investigate its association with other obstetric interventions. We conducted a secondary analysis of data collected by the Maternal Newborn Health Registry, a prospective population-based pregnancy registry established in Central India (Nagpur, Eastern Maharashtra). We examined type of birth and use of episiotomy in vaginal deliveries from 2014 to 2018, as well as maternal and birth characteristics, health systems factors, and concurrent obstetric interventions associations with its use with multivariable Poisson regression models. During the five-year interval, the rate of episiotomy in vaginal birth rose from 13 to 31% despite a decline in assisted vaginal birth. Associations with episiotomy were found for the following factors: prior birth, multiple gestations, seven or more years of maternal education, higher gestational age, higher birthweight, delivery by an obstetrician (as compared to midwife or general physician), and birth in hospital (as compared to clinic or health center). After adjusting for these factors, year over year rise in episiotomy was significant with an adjusted incidence rate ratio (AIRR) of 1.10 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.12; p\u2009=\u20090.002]. We found an association between episiotomy and several other obstetric interventions, with the strongest relationship for maternal treatment with antibiotics (AIRR 4.23, 95% CI 3.12-5.73; p\u2009=\u20090.001). Episiotomy in this population-based sample from central India steadily rose from 2014 to 2018. This increase over time was observed even after adjusting for patient characteristics, obstetric risk factors, and health system features, such as specialty of the birthing provider. Our findings have important implications for maternal-child health and respectful maternity care given that most women prefer to avoid episiotomy; they also highlight a potential target for antibiotic stewardship as part of global efforts to combat antimicrobial resistance. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under reference number NCT01073475. Episiotomy is a surgical procedure to widen the vaginal opening for childbirth. It was once commonly used worldwide. However, because the procedure can cause pain to mothers and place them at risk for infections and serious tears to the vagina\u2014especially when the cut is directly downward\u2014research suggests it should be used sparingly. As such, it is now less often practiced in high-income countries, but whether the same is true in India is not known. To answer this question, we used a large population-based pregnancy registry, the Maternal Newborn Health Registry, from Central India (Nagpur) to assess the frequency of episiotomy use between 2014 and 2018 and if there were certain maternal characteristics, features of the health care system, and other pregnancy interventions that were related with its use. Over this five-year period, the use of episiotomy during vaginal birth rose more than two-fold. It was more often used on women who had never delivered a baby before, were further along in pregnancy, had higher levels of education, had heavier babies, or were carrying more than one baby. Obstetricians were more likely to perform episiotomy than midwives or general physicians and it was more likely to be performed in hospitals than in clinics or primary health centers. This rise during the five-year interval was significant even when accounting for these patient and provider characteristics, suggesting a shift in medical practice. Because this was an observational study more research is needed to determine if the associations we found are causal.",

This study was a nonblinded intervention study that consisted of a preintervention phase (November 2018-January 2019), an intervention phase (January 2020-December 2020) in which a multipronged behavioral intervention was implemented, and a postintervention phase (January 2021-March 2021). We examined antibiotic use for cystoscopy and transrectal prostate biopsy at 3 separate urologic outpatient clinics. A multipronged behavioral intervention consisted of formal physician education, modification of the electronic health order sets, clinic staff education, literature review, development and introduction of patient questionnaires, and individual audit feedback. The primary outcome was 30-day infections. Secondary outcomes were adherence to the recommended antibiotic protocols, questionnaire completion, and  A total of 2374 patients underwent 3047 cystoscopies, and 547 patients underwent 559 prostate biopsies. The proportions of cystoscopy patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis and prostate biopsy patients receiving augmented antibiotic prophylaxis decreased 33% and 35%, respectively. The odds of postcystoscopy infection were not different between the preintervention and intervention phases and were lower in the postintervention phase. The odds of postbiopsy infection were not changed between the preintervention and intervention phases or between the preintervention and postintervention phases. Implementing a multipronged behavioral intervention reduced and tailored antibiotic use without an increase in 30-day infections. These findings suggest that outpatient antibiotic stewardship and facilitating rapid adoption of guidelines can be accomplished via this approach.",

    "abstract": "Addressing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) stands as a major global health challenge threatening humanity. Resolving this issue can be initiated through emphasizing the significance of AMR education among students in health colleges during their undergraduate studies. Hence, the aim of this study is to assess the pharmacy students' knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding antibiotic resistance in 7 Middle Eastern countries. A cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduate pharmacy students at universities in Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Kuwait between March 2021 and January 2022. The first section of the questionnaire gathered demographic information. The knowledge section comprised 7 questions. Subsequently, the questionnaire explored participants' attitudes (6 items) and practices (2 items) concerning antibiotic resistance. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare the median knowledge score between different demographic groups. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for being more knowledgeable about antibiotic resistance. A 2-sided P\u2005<\u2005.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 4265 pharmacy students were involved in this study (Egypt (2249), Jordan (n\u2005=\u2005704), Saudi Arabia (n\u2005=\u2005531), Lebanon (n\u2005=\u2005401), United Araba Emirates (n\u2005=\u2005130), Qatar (n\u2005=\u2005129), and Kuwait (n\u2005=\u2005121)). The median knowledge score for the participating pharmacy students was 5.00 (IQR\u2005=\u20054.00-6.00) out of 7, equals to 71.4% with 4th, and 5th year students and bachelor of pharmacy program students have higher odds of being more knowledgeable about antibiotics resistance compared to other students (P\u2005<\u2005.05). The majority of the students agreed that antibiotic resistance is increasing, they should be more concerned regarding antibiotic consumption and that government should create more awareness of antibiotic resistance, and that they should have enough knowledge to prevent antibiotic resistance. Around 3 quarters of the students (73.0%) confirmed that they take antibiotic only after getting prescription from their physician and almost half (51.7%) reported that they take antibiotic to manage their fever. The study concluded good educational programs in Middle East pharmacy schools with the need for targeted educational interventions promoting responsible antibiotic stewardship practices among future pharmacists.",

Electronic databases were searched from 2016 to 2022. The studies included were primary research papers involving adult nurses working in a hospital setting, with findings relevant to a diagnostic stewardship role. Thematic analysis was chosen to understand and compare the results, findings and recommendations of the studies. Seven studies were included in the review. The identified themes were: (i) nursing role - to recognize infection, aid diagnosis and review results; (ii) nurse challenges - lack of knowledge and confidence to implement diagnostic stewardship; and (iii) Nurse education, empowerment and use of clinical tools. Research studies do not consistently recognize the full scope of the diagnostic stewardship nursing role, signifying that nurses remain an underused resource in promoting diagnostic stewardship. Research-based clarification of the role of the nurse in diagnostic stewardship, outlined in this review, is therefore vital. Further UK-based, nurse-led research is needed to capture the impact of nurse-driven diagnostic stewardship interventions.",

    "abstract": "Penicillin allergy delabelling (PAD), the process of evaluating penicillin allergy labels, is a key target in antibiotic stewardship, but uptake of the procedure outside clinical studies is limited. We aimed to explore factors that need to be addressed to sustainably implement a clinical pathway for PAD. We conducted a qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews with focus groups consisting of a purposive sample of twenty-five nurses and physicians working in four different hospitals in Western Norway. Systematic text condensation was applied for analysis. Psychological safety was reported as crucial for clinicians to perform PAD. A narrative of uncertainty and anticipated negative outcomes were negatively associated with PAD performance. Education, guidelines, and colleague- and leadership support could together create psychological safety and empower health personnel to perform PAD. Key factors for sustainable implementation of PAD were facilitating the informant's profound motivation for providing optimal health care and for reducing antimicrobial resistance. Informants were motivated by the prospect of a simplified PAD procedure. We identified three main needs for implementation of PAD: (1) creating psychological safety; (2) utilising clinicians' inherent motivation and (3) optimal organisational structures. A planned implementation of PAD must acknowledge clinicians' need for psychological safety and aid reassurance through training, leadership, and guidelines. To implement PAD as an everyday practice it must be minimally disruptive and provide a contextually adaptive logistic chain. Also, the clinician's motivation for providing the best possible healthcare should be utilised to aid implementation. The results of this study will aid sustainable implementation of PAD in Norway.

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant global health threat, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Self-treatment with antibiotics, the practice of using antibiotics without professional guidance, is often considered an important contributor to the emergence and spread of AMR. This study investigated the drivers of self-treatment in three common types of agricultural communities in northern Tanzania. The research employed a comprehensive array of methods, including cross-sectional surveys (n\u2009=\u2009790), interviews (n\u2009=\u200930) and observations (n\u2009=\u2009178) targeting both antibiotic (human and animal) providers and users (patients and farmers). Qualitative interview data were analysed using a coding and association matrix, while descriptive analyses were performed on survey and observation data. Self-treatment with antibiotics was highly prevalent in all communities. Between 41.0% (self-reported) and 60.3% (observed) of human antibiotics were obtained without a prescription and we observed that veterinary antibiotics were regularly purchased in retail shops without referral by a professional. Structural deficiencies in the healthcare system drove this practice: limited access to healthcare facilities, medication stockouts and prolonged waiting times were identified as key factors. The absence of safety nets like insurance schemes further contributed to self-medication. Retail shops offered a convenient and cost-effective alternative when antibiotics were inaccessible or unaffordable. Notably, informal networks comprising treatment vendors, friends or neighbours, as well as personal experiences played a crucial role in guiding individuals in their self-treatment decisions by providing advice on treatment choice and modalities. Addressing self-treatment requires a multi-faceted approach. Improving the availability and accessibility of antibiotics, enhancing healthcare services and involving retail vendors in antibiotic stewardship are essential. Structural issues like access to diagnostics and medicines must be tackled, alongside reducing barriers and incentivising individuals to use professional healthcare services. Training retail vendors to sell specific first-line antibiotics over the counter with guidance on appropriate usage should be considered.

However, it is unclear how Dutch hospital-based nurses envision their contribution to AMS. To explore the views and visions of Dutch bedside nurses on their role regarding appropriate antimicrobial use. A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was conducted. Fourteen bedside nurses in nine different Dutch hospitals participated. Data were analysed using a thematic content analysis. Nurses considered their role regarding appropriate use of antibiotics as an integral part of their daily nursing practice. They envisioned their future role as an expansion of their current practice, improving or intensifying this contribution. Prompting review of antimicrobial treatment by nurses was seen as regular practice. Ward rounds were considered the best moment to exert their nursing role, by showing leadership in communicating about different aspects of AMS. Patient advocacy (\"striving for the best possible care for their patient\") appears to be a driver of the nursing contribution. Nurses perceived a shared responsibility with prescribers on certain aspects of the antimicrobial treatment and wished for a clarification of this role. Education and cognitive reminders such as antibiotic checklist to be used in ward rounds, can support the uptake of the nurses' role. Nurses envision their future role in AMS as an enhanced, elaborated and empowered version of their current daily practice. Education, formal acknowledgment and increased awareness of the nursing role, may advance the contributing role nurses already have.",

Australian optometrists can prescribe a range of antimicrobial agents, but to what extent they consider antimicrobial stewardship is not known. This study evaluated what final-year optometry students and optometrists understood about antimicrobial stewardship in eye care and considered relevance to oral prescribing and education. A knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) questionnaire was developed comprising four sections: i) demographic questions, ii) 10 multiple choice questions regarding Knowledge about antimicrobial agents and likely pathogens, diagnosis, treatment, and preventing resistance, iii) 10 Likert rating scale questions about thoughts and Attitudes, iv) mix of question types (5\u00d7 MCQ: course of action, 16 Likert scale: confidence) related to Practice (diagnosis, management, and prescribing). Descriptive analyses were conducted (medians, mean\u00b1SD, and distributions). Thirteen students and 36 optometrists completed the survey. Both groups had a good understanding of microbial resistance and antibiotic prescribing for ocular conditions; average knowledge scores were 9.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7 and 8.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1 for students and practitioners, respectively. Scores were neutral to agree for questions related to the need for more educational programs. The answers of practice-related MCQs had a dichotomy of answers indicating a diversity of opinion, as can be the case in practice. Average total practice confidence scores were approximately 57/80 for students and 68/80 for optometrists. Optometrists and students were very confident in their ability to conduct an appropriate case history and use their knowledge and clinical skills, including slit lamp anterior eye assessment. The lowest confidence scores were for conducting microbial testing, i.e. taking swabs for pathology. Student and optometrist knowledge, attitudes, and practice around antimicrobial stewardship were high and in line with other health professions globally. There is scope for increased stewardship training.",

Nurses, nurse practitioners, physicians, and other healthcare professionals. A multifaceted intervention focusing on a 6-item mnemonic scoring tool called the BLADDER score was developed based on existing minimum criteria for prescribing antibiotics in patients with presumed UTI. The BLADDER score was combined with ward- and prescriber-level feedback and education. Before the intervention, the mean rate of urine culturing was 12.47 cultures per 1,000 patient days; after the intervention, the rate was 7.92 cultures per 1,000 patient days (IRR 0.87; 95% CI, 0.67-1.12). Urinary antibiotic use declined after the intervention from a mean of 40.55 DDD per 1,000 patient days before and 25.96 DDD per 1,000 patient days after the intervention (IRR 0.68; 95% CI, 0.59-0.79). There was no change in mean patient LOS, acute care transfers, or mortality.

Penicillin allergy evaluations using a direct oral challenge with or without skin testing has been recommended as a delabeling strategy for patients with penicillin reaction histories. Barriers for achieving equitable access, however, exist. Understanding patient perceptions regarding their penicillin allergy across diverse populations is crucial to mitigate potential obstacles to penicillin allergy testing (PAT) and the use of penicillin-like antibiotics after delabeling. The objective of this study was to gather perceptions of patients delabeled of their penicillin allergy after testing through a PAT program. Patients who underwent PAT and had a subsequent allergy removal due to a negative result were interviewed using closed and open-ended questions. A total of 100 patient interviews were completed. Awareness of the risks associated with unnecessary penicillin avoidance and PAT was low. Initial concerns regarding PAT were common but were frequently alleviated with targeted education. Most patients undergoing testing reported a positive experience and would recommend PAT to others. A minority of patients continued to have discordant perceptions regarding their penicillin allergy label with mistrust in the negative result being a critical theme identified. Future interventions increasing the awareness of penicillin allergy labels and the risks and benefits of PAT in the general population are needed and must consider health literacy levels, languages, and cultural contexts. Measures to offer PAT within a clinical setting that has built high levels of patient trust will likely achieve the greatest long-term success.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) constitutes a major threat to global health. While antimicrobial misuse or overuse is one of the main drivers for AMR, little is known about the extent to which antibiotic misuse is due to a lack of national government-led efforts to enforce rational use in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). To assess antimicrobial stewardship and national implementation measures currently in place for optimizing antimicrobial use and for\u00a0slowing the spread of AMR, we invited public health experts from 138 LMICs to participate in a Global Survey of Experts on Antimicrobial Resistance (GSEAR). Key coverage measures, as reported by experts, were compared across countries and also juxtaposed with estimates collected in the 2020-21 World Health Organization-organized Tripartite AMR Country Self-Assessment Survey (TrACSS). A total of 352 completed surveys from 118 LMICs were analysed. Experts in 67% of the surveyed countries reported a national action plan (NAP) on AMR, 64% reported legislative policies on antimicrobial use, 58% reported national training programs for health professionals, and 10% reported national monitoring systems for antimicrobials. 51% of LMICs had specific targeted policies to limit the sale and use of protected or reserve antibiotics. While 72% of LMICs had prescription requirements for accessing antibiotics, getting antibiotics without a prescription was reported to be possible in practice in 74% of LMICs. On average, country efforts reported in TrACSS were substantially higher than those seen in GSEAR. In many LMICs, despite the existence of policies aimed at slowing down the spread of AMR, there are still significant gaps in their implementation and enforcement. Increased national efforts in the areas of enforcement and monitoring of antibiotic use as well as regular monitoring of national efforts are urgently needed to reduce inappropriate antibiotic\u00a0use in LMICs and to slow the spread of AMR globally.",

    "abstract": "Pediatric urinary tract infections (UTIs) require early diagnosis and appropriate treatment to avoid short- and long-term morbidity. Baseline data from 13,000 children across a regional health system demonstrated wide variation in UTI management, including antibiotic choice, duration, and dosing. In 2019, the local antibiotic stewardship team recommended cephalexin as the ideal first-line UTI treatment due to its effectiveness, narrow spectrum, low cost, and palatability. This project aimed to improve first-line prescription of cephalexin as an empiric antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated UTIs from 34% to 75% in children 60 days to 18 years of age presenting to any site within the healthcare system within 6 months. A multidisciplinary team of key stakeholders reviewed baseline data and developed three key drivers. These included a standardized UTI pathway, electronic health record enhancements, and provider education. Interventions were supported by a literature review and implemented via Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles with data monitored bimonthly. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients prescribed cephalexin for presumed UTI over the total number of presumed UTI diagnoses treated with empiric antibiotics throughout the healthcare system. The balancing measure included 14-day return visits for a UTI-related diagnosis across the system. After the release of the updated UTI pathway, first-line cephalexin prescribing for UTI improved from 34% to 66%. There was no change in 14-day revisits for UTI. Standardizing the diagnosis and management of UTIs across the spectrum of coordinated care led to improved system-wide adherence to local antibiotic stewardship guidelines for empiric UTI treatment.",

    "abstract": "Small animal antimicrobial stewardship (AS) is emerging as a priority area in the global battle against antimicrobial resistance. Veterinary practices have limited support for implementation of AS programs, and even within veterinary schools, efforts are largely siloed and often limited in scope. Increased collaboration is needed to support and unify AS and infection prevention and control efforts, and to identify priorities for continued research. To address this, a 2-day in-person small animal AS workshop was held in August 2023. Delegates representing 23 US veterinary schools and 4 corporations/government agencies gathered for a series of lightning talks and focused group discussions in 3 domains: implementation of clinical AS programs, research opportunities and needs, and education. The workshop's goal was to identify and propose solutions for AS challenges. Meeting discussion identified a lack of resources and training as the greatest barriers to hospital AS program advancement and suggested creating standards for AS programs and a road map to support program development. Assessing antimicrobial treatment effects and performing studies to establish necessary treatment durations were considered the highest research priorities. Integrated educational practices were recommended to support unified messaging of AS concepts between preclinical and clinical training. The development of strategies to implement these suggestions was delegated to working groups with a goal to continue meeting biennially as a large group. Sharing news of these efforts is considered integral to heightening awareness and promoting implementation of AS practices moving forward in academic, specialty, and primary care settings.",

    "abstract": "Acute respiratory illness (ARI) is one of the most common reasons children receive antibiotic treatment. Measurement of C-reaction protein (CRP) has been shown to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use among children with ARI in a range of clinical settings. In many resource-constrained contexts, patients seek care outside the formal health sector, often from lay community health workers (CHW). This study's objective was to determine the impact of CRP measurement on antibiotic use among children presenting with febrile ARI to CHW in Uganda. We conducted a cross-sectional, stepped wedge cluster randomized trial in 15 villages in Bugoye subcounty comparing a clinical algorithm that included CRP measurement by CHW to guide antibiotic treatment (STAR Sick Child Job Aid [SCJA]; intervention condition) with the Integrated Community Care Management (iCCM) SCJA currently in use by CHW in the region (control condition). Villages were stratified into 3 strata by altitude, distance to the clinic, and size; in each stratum, the 5 villages were randomly assigned to one of 5 treatment sequences. Children aged 2 months to 5 years presenting to CHW with fever and cough were eligible. CHW conducted follow-up assessments 7 days after the initial visit. Our primary outcome was the proportion of children who were given or prescribed an antibiotic at the initial visit. Our secondary outcomes were (1) persistent fever on day 7; (2) development of prespecified danger signs; (3) unexpected visits to the CHW; (4) hospitalizations; (5) deaths; (6) lack of perceived improvement per the child's caregiver on day 7; and (7) clinical failure, a composite outcome of persistence of fever on day 7, development of danger signs, hospitalization, or death. The 65 participating CHW enrolled 1,280 children, 1,220 (95.3%) of whom had sufficient data. Approximately 48% (587/1,220) and 52% (633/1,220) were enrolled during control (iCCM SCJA) and intervention periods (STAR SCJA), respectively. The observed percentage of children who were given or prescribed antibiotics at the initial visit was 91.8% (539/587) in the control periods as compared to 70.8% (448/633) during the intervention periods (adjusted prevalence difference -24.6%, 95% CI: -36.1%, -13.1%). The odds of antibiotic prescription by the CHW were over 80% lower in the intervention as compared to the control periods (OR 0.18, 95% CI: 0.06, 0.49). The frequency of clinical failure (iCCM SCJA 3.9% (23/585) v. STAR SCJA 1.8% (11/630); OR 0.41, 95% CI: 0.09, 1.83) and lack of perceived improvement by the caregiver (iCCM SCJA 2.1% (12/584) v. STAR SCJA 3.5% (22/627); OR 1.49, 95% CI: 0.37, 6.52) was similar. There were no unexpected visits or deaths in either group within the follow-up period. Incorporating CRP measurement into iCCM algorithms for evaluation of children with febrile ARI by CHW in rural Uganda decreased antibiotic use. There is evidence that this decrease was not associated with worse clinical outcomes, although the number of adverse events was low. These findings support expanded access to simple, point-of-care diagnostics to improve antibiotic stewardship in rural, resource-constrained settings where individuals with limited medical training provide a substantial proportion of care.

    "abstract": "In the past few years, the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare has grown exponentially. Prescription of antibiotics is not exempt from its rapid diffusion, and various machine learning (ML) techniques, from logistic regression to deep neural networks and large language models, have been explored in the literature to support decisions regarding antibiotic prescription. In this narrative review, we discuss promises and challenges of the application of ML-based clinical decision support systems (ML-CDSSs) for antibiotic prescription. A search was conducted in PubMed up to April 2024. Prescribing antibiotics is a complex process involving various dynamic phases. In each of these phases, the support of ML-CDSSs has shown the potential, and also the actual ability in some studies, to favorably impacting relevant clinical outcomes. Nonetheless, before widely exploiting this massive potential, there are still crucial challenges ahead that are being intensively investigated, pertaining to the transparency of training data, the definition of the sufficient degree of prediction explanations when predictions are obtained through black box models, and the legal and ethical framework for decision responsibility whenever an antibiotic prescription is supported by ML-CDSSs.",

    "abstract": "There is limited evidence from antimicrobial stewardship programmes in less-resourced settings. This study aimed to improve the quality of antibacterial prescriptions by mitigating overuse and promoting the use of narrow-spectrum agents in intensive care units (ICUs) in a middle-income country. We established a quality improvement collaborative (QIC) model involving nine Argentine ICUs over 11 months with a 16-week baseline period (BP) and a 32-week implementation period (IP). Our intervention package included audits and feedback on antibacterial use, facility-specific treatment guidelines, antibacterial timeouts, pharmacy-based interventions and education. The intervention was delivered in two learning sessions with three action periods along with coaching support and basic quality improvement training. We included 912 patients, 357 in BP and 555 in IP. The latter had higher APACHE II (17 (95% CI: 12 to 21) vs 15 (95% CI: 11 to 20), p=0.036), SOFA scores (6 (95% CI: 4 to 9) vs 5 (95% CI: 3 to 8), p=0.006), renal failure (41.6% vs 33.1%, p=0.009), sepsis (36.1% vs 31.6%, p<0.001) and septic shock (40.0% vs 33.8%, p<0.001). The days of antibacterial therapy (DOT) were similar between the groups (change in the slope from BP to IP 28.1 (95% CI: -17.4 to 73.5), p=0.2405). There were no differences in the antibacterial defined daily dose (DDD) between the groups (change in the slope from BP to IP 43.9, (95% CI: -12.3 to 100.0), p=0.1413).The rate of antibacterial de-escalation based on microbiological culture was higher during the IP (62.0% vs 45.3%, p<0.001).The infection prevention control (IPC) assessment framework was increased in eight ICUs. Implementing an antimicrobial stewardship program in ICUs in a middle-income country via a QIC demonstrated success in improving antibacterial de-escalation based on microbiological culture results, but not on DOT or DDD. In addition, eight out of nine ICUs improved their IPC Assessment Framework Score.",

Between October 2023 and April 2024, we conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews of clinicians who treat patients aged \u226565 years for urinary tract infections or bacteria in the urine, at infectious disease clinics, community senior living facilities, memory care clinics, and general practice. We developed an interview guide based on a behavior change framework and thematically analyzed written transcripts of audio-recorded interviews using inductive and deductive coding techniques. We identified several common themes surrounding management of asymptomatic bacteriuria from clinicians. These included an emphasis on ordering and interpreting urine tests, tension between guidelines and individual patient care for older adults, use of epidemiologic data to influence prescribing practices, pre-prepared communication talking points, and interest in educational materials for patients and clinical teams. Education about the need for symptoms to supplement urine testing, data about the impact of overuse of antibiotics, and oral and written communication strategies should be addressed to reduce antibiotic prescribing for asymptomatic bacteriuria.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance presents a significant global health threat to modern medicine. The awareness and attitude of future doctors undergoing training may play a crucial role in addressing this important issue, influencing the control of resistance and promoting responsible antibiotic stewardship. This study aimed to estimate knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding antibiotic usage and antimicrobial resistance among tertiary care teaching hospital medical interns. The questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 123 MBBS interns from multiple medical institutions. Intern's knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported practices regarding antibiotic use were recorded. Based on survey responses from 123 participants, 116 (94.31%) were aware of the adverse effects of indiscriminate antibiotic use, recognizing the risks of ineffective treatment, increased adverse effects, prolonged illness, bacterial resistance, and higher medical costs. Most (106, 86.18%) acknowledged the challenges of treating antibiotic-resistant infections, and 69 (56.10%) correctly identified that bacteria are not a cause of the common cold and flu. Most (115, 93.5%) recognized antibiotic resistance as a significant global health problem. In attitude, 90 (73%) believed antibiotics should be avoided for colds, but 80 (65%) thought they hastened fever recovery. Only 48 (39%) recognized that antibiotics contribute to resistance, while 102 (83%) agreed skipping doses fosters resistance. Most support hospital policies (118, 96%) and curriculum courses (112, 91%) for rational antibiotic use.\u00a0Regarding practice, 12 (9.76%) interns admitted to overusing antibiotics, 68 (55.28%) consulted a doctor before starting antibiotics, and 87 (70.73%) checked expiry dates. Additionally, 62 (50.41%) preferred antibiotics for cough and sore throat symptoms. The study highlights that while interns have a good knowledge and awareness of the harms of antibiotic misuse, they are not translating this knowledge into practice. This indicates a disconnect between understanding and application. Therefore, there is a need to add a rational antibiotic prescription and stewardship module to the medical curriculum to ensure that knowledge is effectively translated into changing beliefs and practices.",

    "abstract": "The antibiotic stewardship programme (ASP) is a new concept initiated by WHO, but nurses are not yet ready to adopt the program. The training and empowerment of nurses are the best strategies for enhancing their knowledge and engagement in ASP. This mixed-method study was used to assess perceived roles and barriers of nurses' involvement in ASP. An online survey was conducted among 420 clinical nurses to identify their role, and 23 individual interviews were performed among nurses and infection control practitioners to explore the barriers and recommendations to overcome the identified barriers. The majority of the nurses agreed with the sixteen identified roles in ASP, of which 'antibiotic dosing and de-escalation' (82.61%), 'IV to PO conversion of antibiotic, outpatient antibiotic therapy' (85.23%), and 'outpatient management, long-term care, readmission' of the patients (81.19%) had the lowest agreement from the participants. The major themes generated through the qualitative interviews were a lack of knowledge about ASP, poor communication between multidisciplinary teams, lack of opportunity and multidisciplinary engagement, lack of formal education and training about ASP, lack of ASP competency and defined roles in policy, role conflict or power/position, availability of resources, and lack of protected time. Nurses play an integral role in the successful implementation of antibiotic stewardship programs. The empowerment of nurses will help them to adopt the unique role in ASP. Nurses can significantly contribute to antibiotic stewardship efforts and improve patient outcomes through addressing these challenges.",

Yet, radiologist resources to rapidly report the chest CTs are limited. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of emergency clinicians' assessments of chest ultralow-dose CTs for community-acquired pneumonia using a radiologist's assessments as reference standard. This was a cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study. Ten emergency department clinicians (five junior clinicians, five consultants) assessed chest ultralow-dose CTs from acutely hospitalised patients suspected of having community-acquired pneumonia. Before assessments, the clinicians attended a focused training course on assessing ultralow-dose CTs for pneumonia. The reference standard was the assessment by an experienced emergency department radiologist. Primary outcome was the presence or absence of pulmonary opacities consistent with community-acquired pneumonia. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated using generalised estimating equations. All clinicians assessed 128 ultralow-dose CTs. The prevalence of findings consistent with community-acquired pneumonia was 56%. Seventy-eight percent of the clinicians' CT assessments matched the reference assessment. Diagnostic accuracy estimates were: sensitivity\u2009=\u200983% (95%CI: 77-88), specificity\u2009=\u200970% (95%CI: 59-81), positive predictive value\u2009=\u200980% (95%CI: 74-84), negative predictive value\u2009=\u200978% (95%CI: 73-82).

Antimicrobial stewardship programs may create and implement interventions at the point of urine test ordering, urine test resulting, or at the point of prescribing antibiotics after results have returned. Specific design and implementation of stewardship interventions depends on context. To maximize their impact, interventions should be accompanied by education and garner buy-in from providers.

    "abstract": "Understanding drivers of antibiotic use is key to limiting the development of antimicrobial resistance. Outpatient antibiotic prescribing rates vary substantially across and within states. Kentucky is one of the highest prescribing states, and the southeastern region has rates that are drastically higher than the national average and urban areas of the state. We sought to examine provider perceptions of antibiotic use in this rural area to more effectively guide future interventions and policy. This study utilized Medicaid prescription claims to identify providers who frequently prescribe antibiotics to children in southeastern Kentucky. Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted to elicit provider perspectives on antibiotic overuse. Individual, in-person interviews were conducted with 25 providers from a variety of practices and training backgrounds (private, nonprofit, retail, physician, advanced practice registered nurses, etc.). The following themes emerged as issues that prescribers consider to contribute to antibiotic overuse: (1) caregiver pressure, especially from grandparents or families who desire a 'quick fix'; (2) business concerns and competition\u00a0and (3) cultural factors related to poverty and rural locations. Interviewed providers were supportive of public education and had mixed views on the effectiveness of delayed fill or provider feedback initiatives. This study highlights unique challenges associated with antibiotic prescribing in rural areas. Findings will guide future interventions through adaptation of existing strategies to better serve this vulnerable population.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is a significant global health issue, exacerbated by the indiscriminate use of antibiotics without antibiograms. Implementing appropriate stewardship programs that monitor and control antibiotic use is essential to minimize resistance development and ensure optimal patient outcomes. This study aims to assess the impact of antibiogram availability and utilization on antibiotic use among healthcare providers in Saudi Arabia, focusing on whether antibiogram data and utilization influence the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing practices. A cross-sectional study design was employed, utilizing a self-administered online survey distributed to physicians, pharmacists, and other healthcare providers across various healthcare settings in Saudi Arabia. Data were collected over a 90-day period, from 1 December 2023 to 29 February 2024. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize participants' characteristics, and data were analyzed based on geographical region, participants' positions, and other predetermined differences. Out of 23,860 contacted individuals, 333 responded, and 283 were included in the analysis. The majority (62.2%) reported the availability of antibiograms at their facilities, with 84.1% utilizing them in clinical practice. The frequency of consulting antibiograms varied, with only 21.6% doing so daily. Key barriers to antibiogram availability included lack of expertise, technological infrastructure, and funding. Most participants (68.8%) observed changes in antibiotic prescription practices post-antibiogram introduction, and 86.9% believed antibiograms could shorten patients' length of stay and improve outcomes. However, only 40.9% had received training on antibiogram use. While healthcare providers in Saudi Arabia have a relatively high level of antibiogram availability and utilization, several barriers hinder their consistent use. Enhancing accessibility, promoting frequent use, and providing targeted training could strengthen the impact of antibiograms on antibiotic prescribing practices and antimicrobial stewardship efforts.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a growing concern for public health. We sought to explore the challenges associated with development and implementation of a complex intervention designed to improve AMS in hospitals. We conducted a qualitative evaluation of a complex AMS intervention with educational, behavioral, and technological components in 5 wards of an English hospital. At 2 weeks and 7 weeks after initiating the intervention, we interviewed 25 users of the intervention, including senior and junior prescribers, a senior nurse, a pharmacist, and a microbiologist. Topics discussed included perceived impacts of different elements of the intervention and facilitators and barriers to effective use. Interviews were supplemented by 2 observations of ward rounds to gain insights into AMS practices. Data were audio-recorded, transcribed, and inductively and deductively analyzed thematically using NVivo12. Tracing the adoption and impact of the various components of the intervention was difficult, as it had been introduced into a setting with competing pressures. These particularly affected behavioral and educational components (eg, training, awareness-building activities), which were often delivered ad hoc. We found that the participatory intervention design had addressed typical use cases but had not catered for edge cases that only became visible when the intervention was delivered in real-world settings (eg, variations in prescribing workflows across different specialties and conditions). Effective user-focused design of complex interventions to promote AMS can support acceptance and use. However, not all requirements and potential barriers to use can be fully anticipated or tested in advance of full implementation in real-world settings.",

Public health agencies curate educational materials that community pharmacy teams can disseminate. Student pharmacists participate in experiential learning at community pharmacies which could be utilized for dissemination of these resources. The objectives of this project were to (1) design a model for dissemination of public health information at community pharmacies; and (2) evaluate both the dissemination model's reach within communities and student pharmacist learnings from engagement in the model. We engaged student pharmacists in a model to disseminate information at community pharmacies for 2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initiatives about Opioid Use Disorder Anti-Stigma and Antibiotic Stewardship Education. The number of pharmacies and student pharmacists who participated from 2021 from 2023 was retrospectively reviewed to demonstrate programmatic reach. A retrospective text mining of student assignments was conducted to evaluate student experiences. Descriptive statistics were used to report quantitative data. An inductive, rapid content analysis was completed for qualitative data. Across 3\u00a0years, 333 student pharmacists participated. Students reached 121 community pharmacies, 139 practicing pharmacist preceptors, and over 2000 patients with education and resources. Eleven student learning points emerged from the qualitative analysis. These included learnings around opioid use disorder and antibiotic stewardship. Students also acknowledged that there are public health needs present in communities and that community pharmacy teams are well-positioned to address these needs. Engaging student pharmacists to distribute curated information from public health authorities, both to pharmacist preceptors and patients at community pharmacies, is one way to educate future pharmacists, pharmacy teams, and communities on public health priorities. Pharmacies can serve as key venues in communities for dissemination of reliable public health information.",

Inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing by dentists occurs frequently and antimicrobial stewardship strategies should include dentistry. The aim of this retrospective analysis of the Australian Hospital National Antimicrobial Prescribing Survey (Hospital NAPS) dataset, was to describe the types of oral and dental indications where antimicrobials were prescribed, and assess the guideline compliance and appropriateness of the antimicrobials in Australian hospitals. Data from the Hospital NAPS was extracted for oral and dental indications from 2013 to 2022. The types of oral and dental indications presented, and the corresponding antimicrobials prescribed were assessed for compliance according to national prescribing guidelines, and appropriateness according to the NAPS structured algorithm. A total of 8,001 prescriptions for 7,477 patients were identified, from 433 hospitals. Antifungal, antibiotic and antiviral agents accounted for 84.5 %, 15.4 % and 0.03 % of prescriptions respectively. A greater proportion of antibiotics were prescribed in regional and rural areas compared to antifungals. The prescriptions assessed as compliant were 80.0 % and 44.7 % of antifungals and antibiotics respectively. Prescriptions assessed as appropriate were 84.4 % of antifungals, and 65.3 % of antibiotic prescriptions. A wide variety of antimicrobials were used with moderate levels of compliance and appropriateness. Future interventions should include targeted education, utilisation of prescribing guidelines, and tools to diagnose and manage oral and dental conditions. Consideration can be given to adjustment of the Hospital NAPS tool to cater for oral conditions and include the provision of dental treatment in the management of these infections. A wide variety of oral and dental conditions are presented in Australian hospital settings, managed by a range of antibiotics and antifungals, with moderate levels of compliance to guidelines and appropriateness. Antimicrobial stewardship strategies should target and support dentistry in hospital settings.",

    "abstract": "Inappropriate or overuse of antibiotic prescribing in primary care highlights an opportunity for antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programs aimed at reducing unnecessary use of antimicrobials through education, policies and practice audits that optimize antibiotic prescribing. Evidence from the early part of the pandemic indicates a high rate of prescribing of antibiotics for patients with COVID-19. It is crucial to surveil antibiotic prescribing by primary care providers from the start of the pandemic and into its endemic stage to understand the effects of the pandemic and better target effective AMS programs. This was a matched pair population-based cohort study that used electronic medical record (EMR) data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN). Participants included all patients that visited their primary care provider and met the inclusion criteria for COVID-19, respiratory tract infection (RTI), or non-respiratory or influenza-like-illness (negative). Four outcomes were evaluated (a) receipt of an antibiotic prescription; (b) receipt of a non-antibiotic prescription; (c) a subsequent primary care visit (for any reason); and (d) a subsequent primary care visit with a bacterial infection diagnosis. Conditional logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between COVID-19 and each of the four outcomes. Each model was adjusted for location (rural or urban), material and social deprivation, smoking status, alcohol use, obesity, pregnancy, HIV, cancer and number of chronic conditions. The odds of a COVID-19 patient receiving an antibiotic within 30\u00a0days of their visit is much lower than for patients visiting for RTI or for a non-respiratory or influenza-like-illnesses (AOR\u2009=\u20090.08, 95% CI[0.07, 0.09] compared to RTI, and AOR\u2009=\u20090.43, 95% CI[0.38, 0.48] compared to negatives). It was found that a patient visit for COVID-19 was much less likely to have a subsequent visit for a bacterial infection at all time points. Encouragingly, COVID-19 patients were much less likely to receive an antibiotic prescription than patients with an RTI.

    "abstract": "Advancements in Artificial Intelligence(AI) have made platforms like ChatGPT increasingly relevant in medicine. This study assesses ChatGPT's utility in addressing bacterial infection-related questions and antibiogram-based clinical cases. This study involved a collaborative effort involving infectious disease (ID) specialists and residents. A group of experts formulated six true/false, six open-ended questions, and six clinical cases with antibiograms for four types of infections (endocarditis, pneumonia, intra-abdominal infections, and bloodstream infection) for a total of 96 questions. The questions were submitted to four senior residents and four specialists in ID and inputted into ChatGPT-4 and a trained version of ChatGPT-4. A total of 720 responses were obtained and reviewed by a blinded panel of experts in antibiotic treatments. They evaluated the responses for accuracy and completeness, the ability to identify correct resistance mechanisms from antibiograms, and the appropriateness of antibiotics prescriptions. No significant difference was noted among the four groups for true/false questions, with approximately 70% correct answers. The trained ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-4 offered more accurate and complete answers to the open-ended questions than both the residents and specialists. Regarding the clinical case, we observed a lower accuracy from ChatGPT-4 to recognize the correct resistance mechanism. ChatGPT-4 tended not to prescribe newer antibiotics like cefiderocol or imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam, favoring less recommended options like colistin. Both trained- ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-4 recommended longer than necessary treatment periods (p-value\u2009=\u20090.022). This study highlights ChatGPT's capabilities and limitations in medical decision-making, specifically regarding bacterial infections and antibiogram analysis. While ChatGPT demonstrated proficiency in answering theoretical questions, it did not consistently align with expert decisions in clinical case management. Despite these limitations, the potential of ChatGPT as a supportive tool in ID education and preliminary analysis is evident. However, it should not replace expert consultation, especially in complex clinical decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Historically, antimicrobials have been used to treat microbial illnesses in humans and animals. But throughout this time, antibiotics that had been successful against particular microorganisms started to lose their effectiveness due to rising inappropriate use brought on by ignorance, negligent attitudes, and improper methods. Our goal in conducting this study was to ascertain the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of doctors with relation to the use of antibiotics in light of the growing global and Sub-Saharan African problem of antimicrobial resistance. In a tertiary hospital in Mogadishu, Somalia, a cross-sectional survey study was carried out to assess experts' and research assistants' knowledge, attitudes, behavior, awareness, and practices regarding the use of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance. A questionnaire consisting of 2 sections and 22 questions was applied to the participants on a voluntary basis. Among the 202 doctors that participated in the study, 49 (24.3%) were specialists, and 153 (75.7%) were assistants. Prescriptions for one to ten antibiotic boxes per week on average were reported by 146 respondents (72.3%). Of the physicians, just 27 (13.4%) did not require assistance when prescribing an antibiotic. The most often accessed sources of support were experts in infectious diseases (43.1%) and national/international antimicrobial guidelines (32.2%). The top three factors contributing to antibiotic resistance in Somalia include misuse of antibiotics (61.4%), unnecessary prescriptions written by doctors (44.6%), and an absence of infectious disease specialists in most institutions (44.1%). As an alarming level of antimicrobial resistance has been observed globally in recent years, the results of our survey will help educate our doctors by gauging their perceptions, attitudes, and knowledge about rational antibiotic use in Sub-Saharan Africa. This will provide better patient outcomes.",

We conducted a cross-sectional survey of adult patients in English and Spanish between January 2020 and June 2021 in six safety-net primary care clinics and two private emergency departments. We assessed the reasons for stopping prescribed antibiotics early and what was done with the leftover antibiotics. Additionally, we determined 1) prior leftover antibiotic use, 2) intention for future use of leftover antibiotics, and 3) sociodemographic factors. Of 564 survey respondents (median age of 51), 45% (251/564) reported a history of stopping antibiotics early, with 171/409 (42%) from safety net and 80/155 (52%) from the private clinics. The most common reason for stopping prescribed antibiotics early was \"because you felt better\" (194/251, 77%). Among survey participants, prior use of leftover antibiotics was reported by 149/564 (26%) and intention for future use of leftover antibiotics was reported by 284/564 (51%). In addition, higher education was associated with a higher likelihood of prior leftover use. Intention for future use of leftover antibiotics was more likely for those with transportation or language barriers to medical care and less likely for respondents with private insurance. Stopping prescribed antibiotics early was mostly ascribed to feeling better, and saving remaining antibiotics for future use was commonly reported. To curb nonprescription antibiotic use, all facets of the leftover antibiotic use continuum, from overprescribing to hoarding, need to be addressed.",

We investigated practices and factors associated with antibiotic use in small-scale commercial broiler farms in Lilongwe district, Malawi.\u00a0We used structured questionnaires to collect data on recent antibiotic use practices among 128 broiler farmers, who kept between 50 and 1 000 birds, from December 2022 to March 2023. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors associated with antibiotic use. Over half (53.1\u202f%, n=68) of the farms reported using antibiotics at least once in the previous production cycle. Overall, 11 different types of antibiotics were used either for treatment and/or preventive purposes, with oxytetracycline (88.2\u202f%), erythromycin (29.4\u202f%), and enrofloxacin (26.5\u202f%) reported as the frequently used.

    "abstract": "Beta-lactam antibiotics are widely used in the intensive care unit due to their favorable effectiveness and safety profiles. Beta-lactams given to patients with sepsis must be delivered as soon as possible after infection recognition (early), treat the suspected organism (appropriate), and be administered at a dose that eradicates the infection (adequate). Early and appropriate antibiotic delivery occurs in >90% of patients, but less than half of patients with sepsis achieve adequate antibiotic exposure. This project aimed to address this quality gap and improve beta-lactam adequacy using the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control Lean Six Sigma quality improvement framework. A multidisciplinary steering committee was formed, which completed a stakeholder analysis to define the gap in practice. An Ishikawa cause and effect (Fishbone) diagram was used to identify the root causes and an impact/effort grid facilitated prioritization of interventions. An intervention that included bundled education with the use of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM; i.e. drug-level testing) was projected to have the highest impact relative to the amount of effort and selected to address beta-lactam inadequacy in the critically ill. The education and TDM intervention were deployed through a Plan, Do, Study, Act cycle. In the 3 months after \"go-live,\" 54 episodes of beta-lactam TDM occurred in 41 unique intensive care unit patients. The primary quality metric of beta-lactam adequacy was achieved in 94% of individuals after the intervention. Ninety-four percent of clinicians gauged the education provided as sufficient. The primary counterbalance of antimicrobial days of therapy, a core antimicrobial stewardship metric, was unchanged over time (favorable result; P\u2009=\u2009.73). Application of the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control Lean Six Sigma quality improvement framework effectively improved beta-lactam adequacy in critically ill patients. The approach taken in this quality improvement project is widely generalizable to other drugs, drug classes, or settings to increase the adequacy of drug exposure.",

Fourteen South African neonatal units (seven public, seven private sector) assembled multidisciplinary teams involving neonatologists, microbiologists, pharmacists, and nurses to implement prospective audit and feedback neonatal antimicrobial stewardship (NeoAMS) interventions. The teams attended seven online training sessions. Pharmacists conducted weekday antibiotic prescription reviews in the neonatal intensive care unit and/or neonatal wards providing feedback to the clinical teams. Anonymized demographic and NeoAMS interventions data were aggregated for descriptive purposes and statistical analysis. During the 20-week NeoAMS intervention in 2022, 565 neonates were enrolled. Pharmacists evaluated seven hundred antibiotic prescription episodes; rule-out sepsis (180; 26%) and culture-negative sepsis (138; 20%) were the most frequent indications for antibiotic prescription. For infection episodes with an identified pathogen, only 51% (116/229) of empiric treatments provided adequate antimicrobial coverage. Pharmacists recommended 437 NeoAMS interventions (0\u00b76 per antibiotic prescription episode), with antibiotic discontinuation (42%), therapeutic drug monitoring (17%), and dosing (15%) recommendations most frequent. Neonatal clinicians' acceptance rates for AMS recommendations were high (338; 77%). Mean antibiotic length of therapy decreased by 24% from 9\u00b71 to 6\u00b79 days (0\u00b71 day decrease per intervention week; P = 0\u00b7001), with the greatest decline in length of therapy for culture-negative sepsis (8\u00b72 days (95% CI 5\u00b77-11\u00b77) to 5\u00b79 days (95% CI 4\u00b76-7\u00b75); P = 0\u00b7032). This neonatal AMS programme was successfully implemented in heterogenous and resource-limited settings. Pharmacist-recommended AMS interventions had high rates of clinician acceptance. The NeoAMS intervention significantly reduced neonatal antibiotic use, particularly for culture-negative sepsis. A grant from Merck provided partial support.",

Out of 202 patients included, there was a 99% compliance rate with antibiotic choice and 69.8% with the antibiotic duration. The SSI rate was identified at 6.4%. The knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey highlighted a strong awareness of SAP guidelines among surgeons, albeit with variations in practice, particularly in antibiotic duration and choice of antibiotics. While there is high adherence to the correct choice of antibiotic for SAP in elective neurosurgery, there are gaps in compliance with the recommended duration of antibiotic use. The study highlights the need for targeted interventions to improve adherence to SAP guidelines, which could potentially reduce the incidence of SSI in neurosurgery. Ongoing education and auditing are essential to optimize SAP practices and enhance patient outcomes in neurosurgery.",

A cross-sectional study was carried out among community pharmacists regarding antimicrobial stewardship. Convenience sampling was used to obtain the required sample from a community pharmacy in Baghdad. In total, 381 participants have completed the survey. The majority of the participants (85.6%) strongly agreed/agreed that \"antimicrobial stewardship programs reduce the problems of antibiotic resistance\"; and 85.5% of them strongly agreed/agreed that community pharmacists required adequate training on antibiotics use. In addition, high percent of community pharmacists (88.4%) strongly agreed/agreed that pharmacists have a responsibility to take a prominent role in antimicrobial stewardship programs and infection-control programs in the health system. The total score of perception was significantly influenced by older age groups, postgraduate degrees, and experience of 6-10 years ( Community pharmacists have a good perception toward antimicrobial stewardship programs, but their role is still limited. More efforts are needed to design better strategies for antimicrobial stewardship in community pharmacy.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global public health crisis that impedes the therapeutic effectiveness of available antimicrobial agents. Due to the high burden of infectious diseases and limited resources, especially trained healthcare professionals, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are particularly susceptible to the detrimental effects of AMR. Sometimes, as the first and last point of contact for patients seeking treatment for infections, community pharmacists can play a pivotal role in the stewardship required for AMR. This review aims to highlight the contributions made by community pharmacists in LMICs as AMR stewards. The review considers the challenges from the perspectives of limited resources, inadequate training, a lack of policies and regulations, and issues related to patient behavior. Community pharmacists in LMICs could optimize their advocacy contributions by focusing on One Health AMR stewardship. Transformational and actionable patient and population-centric antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) is feasible with the synergy of policymakers and other healthcare providers in the implementation of AMS policies and programs that support community pharmacists in their efforts to promote rational antimicrobial use.",

Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programs are recognized as a key intervention to improve antimicrobial use and combat AMR. However, implementation of AMS remains limited in Africa, particularly in Rwanda. This study aimed to assess prescription practices, identify areas for improvement, and promote adherence to AMS principles. Conducted at King Faisal Hospital in Rwanda, this qualitative study used semi-structured interviews with eight participants until saturation was reached. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed, revealing four emerging themes. The first theme was on AMS activities that were working well based on availability of microbiology laboratory results and prescription guidelines as factors influencing antibiotic prescription adjustments. The second theme was related to challenges during the implementation of the AMS program, including the prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics, limited local data on AMR patterns, and stock-outs of essential antibiotics. The third theme was on the importance of adhering to AMR management guidelines at KFH. The last emerged on recommendations from participants centered on regular training for healthcare workers, widespread dissemination of AMR findings across departments, and the enforcement of antibiotic restriction policies. These actions can improve prescription behaviors, upholding the highest standards of patient care, and strengthening the nascent AMS program.",

In response to this, a pharmacist partnership was established between Malawi and Wales (UK) with the aim of strengthening antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) activities in Malawi, with the initial project focusing on two tertiary referral hospitals. The Global Point Prevalence Survey (GPPS) was undertaken for the first time in Malawi at these sites and demonstrated a prescribing rate slightly lower than the African average, with ceftriaxone indicated for almost every bacterial infection. An educational intervention was also delivered, with a train-the-trainer approach upskilling pharmacists at the two sites, who then cascaded co-produced training sessions to an additional 120 multidisciplinary health professionals. A toolkit to support AMS at an individual patient level was also developed and disseminated to provide an ongoing reference to refer to. Both the trainings and toolkit were well received. Over the course of this project, significant progress has been made with the AMS programmes at the two sites, with local staff empowered to implement AMS activities. These interventions could be easily replicated and scaled and support the delivery of some of the AMS elements of the Malawi Ministry of Health National Action Plan for Antimicrobial Resistance.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic self-medication is one of the common causes of antibiotic resistance of bacterial organisms. The COVID-19 pandemic introduced a new paradigm shift and significantly influenced healthcare behaviors, including an increase in antibiotic self-medication, which contributes to antibiotic resistance. This study was aimed at determining the prevalence of antibiotic self-medication and the possible associated factors during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic among adult residents of Tema in Ghana from April to July 2021. Using a cross-sectional design, 400 adults were randomly selected and surveyed using a researcher-assisted questionnaire. Data were analyzed with IBM\u00ae SPSS\u00ae Statistics Version 22.0, considering associations significant at a 95% confidence interval (p < 0.05). Of the 400 respondents, (76%) 304 had practiced antibiotic self-medication within the previous 12 months during the COVID-19 pandemic. Significant factors associated with antibiotic self-medication included gender, age, marital status, education, occupation, and National Health Insurance Scheme subscription. Convenience and avoiding long hospital queues were primary non-medical reasons for antibiotic self-medication, while previous successful experience, easy access to antibiotics, treating symptoms, prophylaxis, and fear of hospital infection were the medical reasons for antibiotic self-medication. Commonly self-administered antibiotics were azithromycin (34%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (22%), and metronidazole (16%) for perceived respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract infections. The high prevalence of antibiotic self-medication observed during the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need for enhanced public education and stricter enforcement of regulations governing antibiotic sales. The non-medical and medical factors of convenience, avoiding long hospital queues, previous successful experience, easy access to antibiotics, treating symptoms, prophylaxis, and fear of hospital infection which motivated antibiotic self-medication practices require the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship interventions.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an important global public health concern in adults and children. Laryngotracheobronchitis (croup) is a common acute respiratory infection (ARI) among children, most often caused by a virus, and should not be treated with antibiotics. Reducing the usage of unnecessary antibiotics in ARI using an antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) is an effective measure against AMR in children. This study investigates the antibiotic prescription pattern in pediatric patients with laryngotracheobronchitis in Korea. Our results will be useful to improve the ASP. The data were obtained from the government agency Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. We analyzed outpatient prescriptions issued to children \u2264 5 years of age with a first-listed diagnosis code for laryngotracheobronchitis, i.e., International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision, code J050 (croup), J040 (laryngitis), or J041 (tracheitis), during 2017-2020. For each prescription, demographic information and information about medical facilities visited (type of hospital, specialty of physician, location of hospital) were extracted. The overall antibiotic prescription rate was subsequently estimated, and multivariable analysis was conducted to determine the associated factors of antibiotic prescription. Prescribed antibiotics were described and classified into extended-spectrum penicillins, cephalosporin, and macrolides. Of 2,358,194 prescriptions reviewed, 829,172 (35.2%) contained antibiotics. In the multivariable analysis, management in a hospital was the strongest factor associated with antibiotic prescription (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 22.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 20.87-23.89;  The results of our study suggest that ASPs need to focus on physicians in hospitals, clinics, general hospitals, and pediatric specialties. Providing education programs to these groups to increase awareness of AMR and appropriate antibiotics use could be effective ASP policy and may help to reduce unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics for laryngotracheobronchitis among pediatric patients and therefore potentially AMR in children in Korea.",

Antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs) with education can resolve a number of barriers recognized in the implementation of successful ASPs. The aim of this study was to assess health professionals' perceptions and status of ASPs in hospitals in 2022. A cross-sectional study was conducted from September 1, 2022 to October 30, 2022. A total of 181 health professionals were included, and a self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. The status of hospitals was assessed using a checklist. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 23, and descriptive statistics and Chi-square tests (X Of the 181 respondents, 163 (90.1\u00a0%), and 161 (89.0\u00a0%) believed that AMR is a significant problem in Ethiopia and globally, respectively. Easy access to antibiotics 155 (85.6\u00a0%), and inappropriate use 137 (75.7\u00a0%) were perceived as key contributors to AMR. Antibiotics were believed to be prescribed/dispensed without laboratory results 86 (47.5\u00a0%), and antibiotic susceptibility patterns were not considered to guide empiric therapy 81 (44.8\u00a0%). ASP was believed to reduce the duration of hospital stays and associated costs 137 (75.7\u00a0%), and improve the quality of patient care 133 (73.5\u00a0%), whereas 151 (83.4\u00a0%), 143 (79\u00a0%), and 142 (78.5\u00a0%) suggested education, institutional guidelines, and prospective audits with feedback interventions to combat AMR in their hospitals, respectively. There were significant differences in perception among professionals based on professional category and attempts by hospitals to implement ASPs. Although ASPs were not functioning according to standard, there have been attempts to implement it in three hospitals. The issue of ASP had never been heard in general hospitals. Currently, it is feasible to implement ASPs in four hospitals. The status of ASP in hospitals was very poor. Despite a lack of prior knowledge on ASPs, most respondents do have a positive perception of AMR and the implementation of ASPs. Pharmacist-led prospective audits and feedback with education and institutional guidelines for empiric antibiotic use can be better implemented in hospitals. Involvement of representatives from infection prevention and control, and collaboration among hospitals in ASP implementation will help establish a strong ASP in the area.",

    "abstract": "To assess whether a two-phase intervention was associated with improvements in antibiotic prescribing among nonhospitalized children with community-acquired pneumonia. In a large health care organization, a first intervention phase was implemented in September 2020 directed at antibiotic choice and duration for children 2\u00a0months through 17\u00a0years of age with pneumonia. Activities included clinician education and implementation of a pneumonia-specific order set in the electronic health record. In October 2021, a second phase comprised additional education and order set revisions. A narrow spectrum antibiotic (eg, amoxicillin) was recommended in most circumstances. Electronic health record data were used to identify pneumonia cases and antibiotics ordered. Using interrupted time series analyses, antibiotic choice and duration after phase one (September 2020-September 2021) and after phase two (October 2021-October 2022) were compared with a preintervention prepandemic period (January 2016-early March 2020). Overall, 3570 cases of community-acquired pneumonia were identified: 3246 cases preintervention, 98 post-phase one, and 226 post-phase two. The proportion receiving narrow spectrum monotherapy increased from 40.6% preintervention to 68.4% post-phase one to 69.0% post-phase two (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). For children with an initial narrow spectrum antibiotic, duration decreased from preintervention (mean duration 9.9\u00a0days, SD 0.5\u00a0days) to post-phase one (mean 8.2, SD 1.9) to post-phase two (mean 6.8, SD 2.3) periods (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). A two-phase intervention with educational sessions combined with clinical decision support was associated with sustained improvements in antibiotic choice and duration among children with community-acquired pneumonia.",

    "abstract": "Dental antibiotic stewardship is crucial in low- and middle-income countries where the burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is high and antibiotic misuse is common. Given that India is the most populous country, the largest antibiotic consumer and has a large dental prescriber population, this study investigated the extent to which current Indian policy and practice for dental antibiotic prescribing and stewardship aligns with the global policy and best practice. The READ approach was used to identify and extract data and synthesize the findings. Policy documents on dental antimicrobial stewardship were identified using a systematic search strategy involving nine medical and grey literature databases (Medline, Global Health, Web of Science, Cochrane, CINAHL, Eldis, Global Index Medicus, Proquest and Opengrey), targeted websites (government organizations and dental regulatory bodies) and contact with experts. Framework analysis was used to code extracted data into themes related to dental antimicrobial stewardship. Of the 3039 records screened, 25 documents were included in the final analysis. The analysis showed a lack of guidelines or toolkits for appropriate antibiotic prescribing in dentistry in India. The treatment guidelines for antimicrobial use in common syndromes published by the Indian Council of Medical Research had no section or content for dental practitioners. Furthermore, the undergraduate dental curriculum developed by the Dental Council of India (DCI), included little content on appropriate antibiotic prescribing and no mention of AMR or stewardship. There were no educational resources either for dental practitioners or patients in the documents. This document analysis showed that there was little or no mention of dental antibiotic prescribing guidelines in key policy documents such as the National Action Plan on AMR. In addition, contradictory and subjective information provided in some policy documents could encourage dentists and other health professionals such as general practitioners to prescribe antibiotics for common dental conditions for which they are contra-indicated. There is an urgent need to develop relevant guidelines and include these in Indian policy documents on AMR particularly the National Action Plan on AMR.",

    "abstract": "Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) present specific challenges for the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes. A growing body of literature is dedicated to AMS in LTCFs. We aimed to summarize barriers to the implementation of full AMS programmes, i.e. a set of clinical practices, accompanied by recommended change strategies. A scoping review was conducted through Ovid-MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase and Cochrane Central. Studies addressing barriers to the implementation of full AMS programmes in LTCFs were included. Implementation barriers described in qualitative studies were identified and coded, and main themes were identified using a grounded theory approach. The electronic search revealed 3904 citations overall. Of these, 57 met the inclusion criteria. All selected studies were published after 2012, and the number of references per year progressively increased, reaching a peak in 2020. Thematic analysis of 13 qualitative studies identified three main themes: (A) LTCF organizational culture, comprising (A1) interprofessional tensions, (A2) education provided in silos, (A3) lack of motivation and (A4) resistance to change; (B) resources, comprising (B1) workload and staffing levels, (B2) diagnostics, (B3) information technology resources and (B4) funding; and (C) availability of and access to knowledge and skills, including (C1) surveillance data, (C2) infectious disease/AMS expertise and (C3) data analysis skills. Addressing inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in LTCFs through AMS programmes is an area of growing interest. Hopefully, this review could be helpful for intervention developers and implementers who want to build on the most recent evidence from the literature.",

    "abstract": "The misuse of antibiotics in livestock contributes to the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. The development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria of animal origin is of public health concern since drug resistant pathogens in animals can spread to humans. Several countries have therefore introduced regulations to restrict the use of antibiotics in livestock. Namibia was the first African country to ban the use of antibiotics as growth promoters and restrict the use of antibiotics to the treatment of bacterial diseases with a prescription from a veterinarian. However, there are limited studies on antibiotic stewardship among farmers in the country. The aim of this study was to determine the antibiotic awareness and usage of cattle farmers in Oshikoto region Namibia. A questionnaire on antibiotic knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) was administered to 274 randomly selected cattle farmers in Namibia. To calculate the KAP scores, one mark was awarded for each correct answer and zero was awarded for incorrect or unsure responses. Respondents having\u2009\u2265\u200950% correct answers were considered as having good KAP scores. The KAP score ranged from 8 to 73%. Forty-three per cent of the respondents had good KAP scores. Good KAP was associated with age, farm type and education status. Semi-commercial/commercial farmers had significantly better KAP than post and homestead farmers. The findings of this study indicate that there is a need to improve antibiotic usage and resistance education programmes in order to promote rational antibiotic usage.",

Implementation science can offer insights into how patient safety practices can be successfully adopted. The objective was to examine the literature on implementation of three internationally used safety practices: medication reconciliation, antibiotic stewardship programmes and rapid response systems. We sought to identify the implementation activities, factors and outcomes reported; the combinations of factors and activities supporting successful implementation; and the implications of the current evidence base for future implementation and research. We searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO and Education Resources Information Center from January 2011 to March 2023. We included original peer-reviewed research studies or quality improvement reports. We used an iterative, inductive approach to thematically categorise data. Descriptive statistics and hierarchical cluster analyses were performed. From the 159 included studies, eight categories of implementation activities were identified:  The multiple activities employed to implement patient safety practices reflect mainly method-based improvement science, and to a lesser degree determinant frameworks from implementation science. There seems to be an unexploited potential for continuous adaptation of implementation activities to address changing contexts. Research-informed guidance on how to make such adaptations could advance implementation in practice.",

This is particularly important for people with vulnerable health conditions, such as people with intellectual disabilities (ID) and long-term care residents. This study aimed to assess the current status of AMR, antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) and infection prevention and control (IPC) in Dutch long-term care facilities for people with intellectual disabilities (ID-LTCFs). A web-based cross-sectional survey distributed between July and November 2023, targeting (both nonmedically and medically trained) healthcare professionals working in ID-LTCFs in The Netherlands, to study knowledge, attitudes and perceptions regarding AMR, AMS and IPC. In total, 109 participants working in 37 long-term care organizations for people with intellectual disabilities throughout the Netherlands completed the questionnaire. The knowledge levels of AMR and IPC among nonmedically trained professionals (e.g., social care professionals) were lower than those among medically trained professionals (p\u2009=\u20090.026). In particular regarding the perceived protective value of glove use, insufficient knowledge levels were found. Furthermore, there was a lack of easy-read resources and useful information regarding IPC and AMR, for both healthcare professionals as well as people with disabilities. The majority of the participants (>\u200990%) reported that AMR and IPC need more attention within the disability care sector, but paradoxically, only 38.5% mentioned that they would like to receive additional information and training about IPC, and 72.5% would like to receive additional information and training about AMR. Although the importance of AMR and IPC is acknowledged by professionals working in ID-LTCFs, there is room for improvement in regards to appropriate glove use and setting-specific IPC and hygiene policies. As nonmedically trained professionals comprise most of the workforce within ID-LTCFs, it is also important to evaluate their needs.

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global public health challenge. Global efforts to decrease AMR through antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) initiatives include education and optimising the use of diagnostic technologies and antibiotics. Despite this, economic and societal challenges hinder AMS efforts. The objective of this study was to obtain insights from healthcare professionals (HCPs) on current challenges and identify opportunities for optimising diagnostic test utilisation and AMS efforts. Three hundred HCPs from six countries (representing varied gross national incomes per capita, healthcare system structure, and AMR rates) were surveyed between November 2022 through January 2023. A targeted literature review and expert interviews were conducted to inform survey development. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise survey responses. These findings suggest that the greatest challenges to diagnostic test utilisation were economic in nature; many HCPs reported that AMS initiatives were lacking investment (32.3%) and resourcing (40.3%). High resistance rates were considered the greatest barriers to appropriate antimicrobial use (52.0%). Most HCPs found local and national guidelines to be very useful (\u2265\u200951.0%), but areas for improvement were noted. The importance of AMS initiatives was confirmed; diagnostic practices were acknowledged to have a positive impact on decreasing AMR (70.3%) and improving patient outcomes (81.0%). AMS initiatives, including diagnostic technology utilisation, are pivotal to decreasing AMR rates. Interpretation of these survey results suggests that while HCPs consider diagnostic practices to be important in AMS efforts, several barriers to successful implementation still exist including patient/institutional costs, turnaround time of test results, resourcing, AMR burden, and education. While some barriers differ by country, these survey results highlight areas of opportunities in all countries for improved use of diagnostic technologies and broader AMS efforts, as perceived by HCPs. Greater investment, resourcing, education, and updated guidelines offer opportunities to further strengthen global AMS efforts. Antimicrobials are medications used to treat infections caused by bacteria (e.g. antibiotics), viruses, parasites, and fungi. Over time, these microbes may become resistant to antimicrobials, limiting how well they work. This often happens as a result of overuse, using antimicrobials when there is not an infection, or using an inappropriate antimicrobial. Antimicrobial resistance is a growing global problem. Antimicrobial stewardship programs aim to improve appropriate use of antimicrobials. Diagnostic testing plays an important role in these programs by identifying the microbes responsible for infections so patients can be given the right treatment as quickly as possible. We aimed to obtain the perspective of healthcare professionals from six countries on the challenges of and ways to improve diagnostic testing and antimicrobial stewardship programs. We found that some of the greatest challenges were related to costs. Approximately one-third of participants said that antimicrobial stewardship initiatives were lacking investment (32.3%) and resourcing (40.3%). High rates of antimicrobial resistance were identified as the greatest barriers to appropriate antimicrobial use (52.0%). Participants said that diagnostic practices have a positive impact on decreasing antimicrobial resistance (70.3%) and improving patient outcomes (81.0%). Overall, we found that healthcare professionals consider diagnostic tests to be an important part of antimicrobial stewardship, but there are several barriers to their success, including patient/hospital costs, turnaround time of test results, resourcing, antimicrobial resistance, and education. To overcome these barriers, increased funding, education, and resourcing, regular guideline updates, and development of optimised testing algorithms may help to improve antimicrobial stewardship and ultimately decrease antimicrobial resistance.",

The Department of Health (DOH) institutionalized the Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) Program in hospitals, based on the core elements  A quantitative descriptive study design was employed by administering an online 50-item survey questionnaire to AMS pharmacists, who have at least six (6) months of experience as an AMS pharmacist in the hospital. The survey questionnaire was validated by an expert consultant and underwent pre-testing (Cronbach \u03b1 = 0.983) for acceptable internal consistency. Responses were collated, coded, and analyzed using median values and frequency distributions for each questionnaire item per Department of Health (DOH) Core Element. Items garnering a median of >3.50 up to 5 were considered as perceived enablers, while those \u22643.50 were identified as perceived challenges. Some perceived enablers by the AMS pharmacists include presence of a leader and/or clinician in the AMS team, Information Technology (IT) resource availability, clear roles of AMS pharmacists, readily available hospital AMS guidelines, engagement in AMR and AMU surveillance activities, regular performance of AMS interventions (e.g., IV-to-PO conversion, dose optimization, de-escalation of broad spectrum), regular monitoring and evaluating of prescriptions and prescribing behavior, and continuous education on infection, prevention, and control (IPC) and hygiene. On the other hand, some perceived challenges include insufficient funding, inadequate knowledge in interpreting antibiograms, lack of adequate and specialized training sessions, lack of coordination with medical and nursing staff to ensure timely drug administration and automatic stop order, prescribing of non-Philippine National Formulary (PNF) antimicrobials, lack of time to perform AMS activities, lack of qualified personnel, and lack of hospital management and information technology (IT) support. Empowering AMS clinical pharmacists is vital to addressing the perceived challenges and maximizing the perceived enablers to ensure the successful implementation of the AMS program in the hospital.",

To date, antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) efforts around IVOS have not focused on the nursing staff who administer antibiotics, which represents a significant gap in AMS programmes. To determine the involvement of bedside nurses in acute trusts in the Midlands region of England in IVOS in their organizations and describe their views regarding how to improve IVOS. An anonymous self-administered mixed-methods online survey was developed and distributed to nursing staff in acute trusts via antimicrobial stewardship networks between March and May 2023. Quantitative data was analysed to describe participant demographics and behaviours, whereas barriers and enablers to IVOS were explored through thematic content analysis of responses to open-ended questions. A total of 545 nursing staff responded to the survey. The majority (65.3%) routinely suggested IVOS to clinicians, despite only 50.6% being aware of local IVOS policies. One-third (34.7%) did not suggest IVOS, relying on doctors, believing their patients needed IV treatment, or lacked knowledge and skills to request IVOS. Content analysis of suggestions for improving the rate of IVOS proposed three major themes (People, Process, System) and identified that education and training, improved confidence and interprofessional relationships, and prompts were important drivers. Nursing staff suggest IVOS to other clinicians, but more education and resources are needed to enable and empower them in this role.",

At the same time, it has also drastically impacted the natural environment and human society. The One Health initiative emphasizes the interdependency of the health of ecosystems, animals, and humans. In this paper, we discuss some of the most profound consequences of animal agriculture practices from a One Health perspective. More specifically, we focus on impacts to host-microbe interactions by elaborating on how modern animal agriculture affects zoonotic infections, specifically those of bacterial origin, and the concomitant emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). A key question underlying these deeply interconnected issues is how to better prevent, monitor, and manage infections in animal agriculture. To address this, we outline approaches to mitigate the impacts of agricultural bacterial zoonoses and AMR, including the development of novel treatments as well as non-drug approaches comprising integrated surveillance programs and policy and education regarding agricultural practices and antimicrobial stewardship. Finally, we touch upon additional major environmental and health factors impacted by animal agriculture within the One Health context, including animal welfare, food security, food safety, and climate change. Charting how these issues are interwoven to comprise the complex web of animal agriculture's broad impacts on One Health will allow for the development of concerted, multidisciplinary interventions which are truly necessary to tackle these issues from a One Health perspective.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a threat to public health globally. Despite its consequences, there is little information about the knowledge, awareness, and practices towards AMR among healthcare workers (HCWs). Therefore, this study assessed the knowledge, awareness and practices regarding antimicrobial use (AMU), AMR and antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) among HCWs who are involved in the implementation of AMS activities across eight hospitals in Zambia. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 64 HCWs from October to December 2023 using a semi-structured questionnaire. Data were analysed using IBM SPSS version 25.0. Of the 64 HCWs, 59.4% were females, 60.9% were aged between 25 and 34 years, 37.5% were nurses, 18.7% were pharmacists, 17.2% were medical doctors and only one was a microbiologist. Overall, 75% of the HCWs had good knowledge, 84% were highly aware and 84% had good practices regarding AMU, AMR and AMS. Most of the HCWs (90.6%) responded that they had a multidisciplinary AMS team at their hospitals and were implementing the use of the WHO AWaRe classification of antibiotics. This study found good knowledge levels, high awareness and good practices regarding AMU, AMR and AMS among HCWs who were involved in the implementation of AMS activities in hospitals in Zambia. Additionally, most hospitals have been conducting AMS training and implementing the use of the WHO AWaRe classification of antibiotics.

    "abstract": "The US healthcare system's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change is disproportionately high and harms the public. Several medical specialties are now reassessing how they can mitigate healthcare's harmful environmental impact. Healthcare sustainability is broadly defined as measures to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, waste, and other pollutants generated during the healthcare delivery process. Prior efforts and programs by infectious diseases (ID) professionals, such as antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention and control can form a framework for ID professionals to help apply this expertise to healthcare environmental sustainability more broadly. This call to action proposes strategies for ID societies and professionals to incorporate climate change education for trainees, increase research and funding opportunities in healthcare sustainability, and calls for action by ID societies to champion system changes to decrease greenhouse gas emissions.",

    "abstract": "The goal of antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs) is to ensure that patients receive effective therapy while minimizing adverse events. To overcome barriers commonly faced in implementing successful ASPs, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) established a multifaceted, nationwide Safety Program for Improving Antibiotic Use in 2018. This report summarizes the lessons learned from the implementation of this initiative based on structured interviews of personnel from participating sites. At the completion of the one-year initiative, semistructured exit interviews were conducted with site leaders at 151 of the 402 hospitals that participated. These interviews consisted of open-ended questions about the perceived effectiveness of components of the Safety Program. Qualitative analyses incorporated both deductive coding themes (based on existing literature) and an iteratively developed inductive coding framework (based on salient themes that emerged from a subset of interviews). Several components of the Safety Program were identified as effective in expanding local stewardship activities, including techniques and strategies to implement sustainable ASPs, access to Implementation Advisors to keep sites engaged, provision of local benchmarked antibiotic use data to compare to similar hospitals, and Safety Program materials such as the antibiotic time-out tool to integrate stewardship techniques into daily work flows. The biggest challenges to greater effectiveness were suboptimal frontline staff engagement and difficulty changing antibiotic prescribing culture. Some approaches used to overcome these barriers (peer-to-peer communication and education through team huddles, identifying physician champions, informal rounds to enhance collegiality and buy-in, and engagement of hospital leadership) were identified. Lessons learned from the Safety Program can be applied by other teams looking to promote an effective ASP at their hospital or system. The themes that emerged in this study likely also have relevance across a wide range of large-scale quality improvement initiatives.",

    "abstract": "An important component in fostering the responsible use of antibiotics is training of new and future prescribers in this interdisciplinary topic. Because podcasts are playing an increasing role in medical education, we aimed to develop and evaluate a podcast format with practice and guideline-oriented learning content on antibiotic therapy for medical students and young medical professionals. We developed the concept for the podcast with the direct involvement of medical students and medical experts with teaching experience. We used video conferencing when recording the episodes in order to have quick, easy, and nationwide access to the experts involved. We released an episode every 2 to 4 weeks on the popular podcast platforms. The podcast was promoted through mailing lists, social and print media, and at conferences. The evaluation of episodes was based on user data provided by the platforms and an anonymous feedback questionnaire linked to each episode in the podcast notes. Between December 2021 and December 2022 19 episodes of InfectEd: der Antibiotika-Podcast were released. The mean duration of an episode was 91\u00a0min. By March 9, 2023, a total of 38,829 downloads and streams had been recorded. The majority of users listened to the podcast on a mobile device. The average playing time per episode was 65%. The feedback questionnaire was completed 135 times. 60.7% of respondents were female, 38.5% male. The majority of respondents were in their twenties and thirties (66.7%). 31.1% were medical students, 25.9% were residents, and 25.2% were specialists. Listeners were asked to rate episodes on a scale from 1 to 6, where 1 was \"very good\" and 6 was \"insufficient.\" Ratings did not differ significantly between female and male respondents or between medical students and others. 118 respondents (87.4%) reported an increase in knowledge. Free-text feedback frequently emphasized clinical and also exam relevance. Our podcast format, developed with a user-centered approach, was broadly distributed and has been well accepted by both medical students and physicians alike. It provides a large number of learners with low-threshold access to current, guideline-orientated content and could be a useful supplement to conventional teaching formats.",
