41176483,Maternal vaccination to prevent neonatal infections and combat antimicrobial resistance.,"Galiza EP, Nakebembe E, Mboizi R, Okek E, Le Doare K",2025,Seminars in fetal & neonatal medicine,"Maternal vaccination during pregnancy is emerging as a powerful strategy in protecting newborns from infectious diseases, improving neonatal outcomes, and potentially reducing antimicrobial use and resistance. Maternal immunisation works by eliciting protective antibodies in the mother that are transferred to the fetus transplacentally and through breastmilk postnatally to provide the infant with passive immunity during the first vulnerable months of life. There is sufficient evidence to support the role of maternal vaccination in averting many neonatal infections that would otherwise require medical intervention. By preventing infections in mothers and their newborn, maternal vaccination also holds significant potential for reducing antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance. Fewer neonatal infections translate to a reduced need for antimicrobial use in the neonatal period and in postpartum women, therefore lowering the selective pressure for drug-resistant bacteria. Routine maternal vaccines (tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis (Tdap), influenza, COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus) already confer measurable antibiotic-sparing benefits by preventing infections that typically trigger antimicrobial therapy in mothers and neonates. Pipeline candidates (Group B Streptococcus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli) could further lower neonatal sepsis burden, reducing broad-spectrum antimicrobial use in neonatal intensive care units to help slow antimicrobial resistance. Integrated with antibiotic stewardship and infection-prevention measures, maternal immunisation offers a practical, scalable practice to limit perinatal antibiotic exposure.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41176483/,10.1016/j.siny.2025.101680
41173019,Effect of decreasing the frequency of screening for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis on the incidence of these infections and antimicrobial use among men who have sex with men using HIV PrEP in Belgium: a retrospective cohort study.,"Vanbaelen T, De Baetselier I, Tsoumanis A, Hensen B, Kenyon C",2025,The Lancet. Microbe,"There is growing evidence that the benefits of systematic screening for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis among men who have sex with men (MSM) using HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are scarce and that screening leads to high antimicrobial consumption. The PrEP clinic of the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM) in Antwerp, Belgium, discontinued systematic screening for these infections in MSM taking PrEP in 2023. In this study, we estimated the effect of reducing the frequency of screening on the incidence of these infections and antimicrobial use among MSM using PrEP. We did a retrospective cohort analysis of medical records, laboratory results, and antimicrobial prescriptions (ceftriaxone, doxycycline, and azithromycin) of MSM attending the PrEP clinic of the ITM in Antwerp, Belgium, between Jan 1, 2019, and Dec 31, 2024. We estimated yearly testing rates for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis, incidence rates of overall and symptomatic infections, and antimicrobial prescription rates. Results were analysed using Poisson regression, with the number of events as the outcome, years as a continuous predictor and the log(person-time) as offset. Additionally, we did three sensitivity analyses: limiting our study population to individuals engaged in PrEP care in 2019; excluding participants of the Gonoscreen study; and using time as a categorical variable. Between Jan 1, 2019, and Dec 31, 2024, 3955 MSM attended the clinic. Over the study period, 11 720 tests were done during 9853·85 person-years. The testing rate decreased significantly from 2267·78 tests per 1000 person-years (95% CI 2176·49-2361·92) in 2019 to 552·81 tests per 1000 person-years (521·53-585·47) in 2024 (yearly rate ratio 0·78, 95% CI 0·77-0·78; p<0·0001). The incidence of N gonorrhoeae decreased from 170·84 cases per 1000 person-years (95% CI 146·47-198·11) in 2019 to 85·81 cases per 1000 person-years (73·77-99·27) in 2024 (yearly incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0·91, 95% CI 0·88-0·94; p<0·0001). In the same period, the incidence of C trachomatis decreased from 198·17 cases per 1000 person-years (95% CI 171·85-227·39) in 2019 to 60·69 cases per 1000 person-years (50·63-72·16) in 2024 (yearly IRR 0·84, 95% CI 0·81-0·87; p<0·0001). There was no increase in the incidence of symptomatic N gonorrhoeae (IRR 0·98, 95% CI 0·92-1·03), C trachomatis (0·95, 0·88-1·01), or lymphogranuloma venereum (0·95, 0·84-1·09). Ceftriaxone, doxycycline, and azithromycin prescriptions decreased (rate ratio 0·95, 95% CI 0·91-0·99; p=0·023, 0·47, 0·43-0·52; p<0·0001, and 0·90, 0·87-0·94; p<0·0001, respectively). Similar results were found in the first sensitivity analysis. In the sensitivity analysis excluding participants of the Gonoscreen study, rates of ceftriaxone and doxycycline prescriptions decreased between 2019 and 2024 but became non-significant. In the third sensitivity analysis, using time as a categorical variable, the prescription rates of ceftriaxone were lower in 2024 compared with 2019 and the incidence rates of symptomatic C trachomatis were significantly lower in 2024 compared with 2019. The incidence of symptomatic N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis infections did not increase over time despite less frequent screening and antimicrobial prescriptions decreased. Our findings contribute to the evidence supporting the potential of reducing the frequency of screening as an antimicrobial stewardship intervention among MSM using PrEP. Future studies are needed to confirm our findings. None.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41173019/,10.1016/j.lanmic.2025.101214

This retrospective single-center study included 76 adult patients treated with continuous-infusion OPAT via elastomeric pumps between 2019 and 2024 at the University Hospital of Trieste, Italy. A total of 1,934 elastomeric pump-based OPAT days were delivered (median duration of 22.9 days). Clinical cure was achieved in 85.5% of patients; recurrence and failure occurred in 6.2% and 7.9%, respectively. Most frequent indications were skin/soft tissue and surgical site infections (25.9%), complicated urinary tract infections (22.4%), and bone/joint infections (16.4%). Pathogens were mainly Gram-negative (70.7%), including Enterobacterales (40.2%, 57.6% ESBL-producing), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (26.8%), and Staphylococcus aureus (17.1%, 28.6% methicillin-resistant S. aureus). The most used antibiotics were piperacillin/tazobactam (51.3%), cefepime (12.5%) and ceftolozane/tazobactam (7.5%).

A cross-sectional survey was conducted across 64 sub-districts in eight divisions of Bangladesh, assessing the KAP concerning antibiotic use (ABU) and antibiotic resistance (ABR) through a pretested questionnaire. A total of 1,248 participants took part in the KAP survey. Data collection methods included face-to-face interactions, email, and courier services, followed by subsequent analysis. The results revealed that registered veterinarians achieved a 100% knowledge score regarding recommended doses and standard practices. While farmers and informal practitioners generally agreed with some antibiotic practices, 10.71% recognized the importance of withdrawal periods, 11.07% acknowledged public health risks, and 5.71% understood the residual effects of antibiotics. Similarly, among informal practitioners, awareness was low, with only 14.46%, 16.75%, and 7.71%, respectively. These findings show that many farmers and informal practitioners have limited KAP regarding antibiotic use and resistance. The analysis showed that demographic factors, such as education had a significant impact on participants' KAP (OR=8.06; 95% CI: 6.07-10.70; p< 0.001) regarding ABU and ABR. In particular, registered veterinarians were nearly three times more likely to have accurate KAP compared to those with lower education levels (aOR = 2.78; 95% CI: 1.94-4.00; p< 0.001).

41164032,Advanced Insights Into Intravascular Bloodstream Infections: A Cross-Sectional Study of the Molecular Characterization of World Health Organization Priority Pathogens and Antimicrobial Resistance Patterns at a Tertiary Care Hospital.,"Reddy A L, Cp R, N S, Jk SP",2025,Cureus,"Introduction Bloodstream infections (BSIs), particularly intravascular types such as catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) and infective endocarditis (IE), represent a significant public health challenge due to their high morbidity and potential to rapidly progress to sepsis. The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens necessitates molecular surveillance to inform effective antimicrobial strategies, especially in regions like India, where resistance data is limited. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted over seven months, enrolling 101 patients from cardiology, nephrology, and ICUs at a tertiary care hospital in Chennai. Patients with confirmed intravascular BSIs were identified using clinical criteria and modified Duke's definitions. Blood cultures and catheter tip analyses were performed using standard microbiological techniques. Phenotypic resistance mechanisms were assessed via extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), methicillin resistance, and CARBA NP testing. Molecular characterization included polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of resistance genes (blaKPC, blaNDM, blaCTX-M, blaTEM, OXA-23, OXA-48, mecA). Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 31.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Means and proportions were reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results The cohort included patients aged 13-68 years, with a male predominance (70 patients, 70%). CRBSIs accounted for 86 cases (85%). All patients underwent internal jugular vein (IJV) catheterization, primarily for hemodialysis in chronic kidney disease (CKD) (68 patients, 68%). Blood culture positivity was observed in 49 patients (48.5%), with Klebsiella pneumoniae (14 patients, 13.9%), Pseudomonas spp. (10 patients, 9.9%), and Staphylococcus aureus (8 patients, 7.9%) as dominant isolates. ESBL production was highest in Escherichia coli (four out of five isolates, 80%) and Klebsiella (10 out of 14 isolates, 71.4%). Carbapenemase genes blaNDM and blaKPC were detected in five out of 14 Klebsiella isolates (35.7%), while OXA-23 was found in five out of six Acinetobacter isolates (83.3%). A significant correlation was found between catheter duration and culture positivity using a scatter plot demonstration. Targeted antimicrobial therapy was successful in 71 patients (70%), although complications such as persistent bacteremia and septic shock were noted. Conclusions This study underscores the high prevalence of CRBSIs and the concerning presence of molecular resistance markers in key pathogens. The predominance of carbapenemase genes such as blaNDM, blaKPC, and OXA variants highlights the urgent need for molecular diagnostics and robust antibiotic stewardship in India. Continued surveillance of intravascular BSIs and resistance profiles is essential to improve clinical outcomes and combat antimicrobial resistance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41164032/,10.7759/cureus.93375

Participants were selected using purposive and convenience sampling techniques. Semi-structured interviews, explored behavioral and sociocultural determinants of antimicrobial use. A codebook was refined iteratively by two coders to ensure consistency. Data were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using Dedoose software through thematic analysis. Ethical approval was obtained, and confidentiality was maintained throughout. The identified themes were linked with Theoretical domains framework domains to enhance the depth of understanding. Five key themes emerged: limited knowledge and misconceptions about antimicrobials, with many viewing them as universal cures; prevalent self-medication and non-prescription use, driven by accessibility and trust in pharmacists; varied healthcare-seeking behaviors, influenced by trust and logistical barriers; sociocultural influences, including peer advice and traditional beliefs combining antibiotics with remedies; and structural and economic barriers, such as limited healthcare access and high costs, promoting misuse. These factors, rooted in knowledge gaps, cultural norms, and systemic weaknesses, contribute significantly to inappropriate antimicrobial use and AMR. The study highlights how misconceptions, self-medication, sociocultural norms, and structural barriers drive inappropriate antimicrobial use in Addis Ababa, exacerbating AMR. Multifaceted interventions are needed, including community education to address knowledge gaps, stricter prescription regulations, improved healthcare access through expanded insurance and clinics, and engagement with cultural leaders to align practices with evidence-based use. These strategies can mitigate AMR while ensuring equitable access to effective treatments, addressing both behavioral and systemic challenges.

This study elucidated their prevalence and associated factors among university students in Vietnam. Cross-sectional study. Vietnam. 2230 university students. Antibiotic storage was evaluated at the time of the survey, while self-medication was assessed for 1 year preceding this time. Associated factors were determined via multivariable logistic regression models. Among 2230 participants, 418 (18.7%) reported self-medicating with antibiotics. The three main reasons for this behaviour included saving time (48.6%), mild diseases (45.0%) and the ease of purchasing antibiotics from community pharmacies (43.8%). Community pharmacies (88.3%) and home storage (36.4%) were the primary sources of antibiotics for self-treatment. Students mainly selected antibiotics based on community pharmacists' consultation (59.8%) and their knowledge/experience (37.8%). They commonly read the patient information leaflet (64.6%) and asked for the community pharmacist's advice to obtain information about antibiotic usage (52.9%). Besides, 296 students (13.3%) stored antibiotics at home. Over two-thirds had antibiotic leftovers from previous treatment and stored them for future use (69.3%), while 46.3% purchased antibiotics from community pharmacies without a prescription. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was the most commonly used antibiotic for self-medication (59.8%) and home storage (54.4%). Antibiotic self-medication was significantly associated with older age (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=1.25; 95% CI 1.15 to 1.35), non-healthcare students (aOR=0.47; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.63), higher knowledge score (aOR=1.05; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.07) and storing antibiotics at home (aOR=7.12; 95% CI 5.34 to 9.51). Factors associated with home storage of antibiotics included non-healthcare students (aOR=2.77; 95% CI 2.01 to 3.83), region (north: aOR=6.50; 95% CI 3.49 to 13.54; south: aOR=5.92; 95% CI 3.06 to 12.65), having a family member working in the medical field (aOR=1.70; 95% CI 1.29 to 2.25), higher knowledge score (aOR=1.05; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.08) and antibiotic self-medication (aOR=7.58; 95% CI 5.69 to 10.14) (p values<0.001). The prevalence of antibiotic self-medication and home storage among students was relatively low but still raises public health concerns.

This article aims to critically evaluate and debunk several widespread myths in infectious disease management that lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Through a nonsystematic literature review, this manuscript examines key misconceptions across various aspects of antimicrobial therapy, including administration routes, drug mechanisms, treatment duration, and the interplay with infection source control. It also explores the influence of evolving concepts like long-acting antimicrobials and the human microbiome. We challenge the dogmas that intravenous antibiotics are superior to oral agents, that longer courses are always better, and that bactericidal drugs are more effective than bacteriostatic ones. The review highlights the paramount importance of source control and surgical intervention in treating severe infections and cautions against misinformation surrounding the human microbiome. The medical community must critically re-evaluate long-standing clinical practices to improve antibiotic stewardship. By debunking these myths, we can promote a more precise, safe, and effective approach to antimicrobial use, ultimately reducing unnecessary prescribing and combating antimicrobial resistance.

Notably, veterinary antibiotic sales in Switzerland have dropped by >50% in the past decade. However, a further breakdown by species or detailed livestock classes such as dairy or fattening cattle has so far not been possible because products are often authorized for use in multiple species and sectors. In 2020, the Swiss national monitoring system for antibiotic use (IS ABV) was introduced, which has substantially improved the availability of detailed data on antibiotic use. The aim of this study is to provide a high-level overview of IS ABV, its technical implementation and the current state of the system, highlighting its strengths and current and past weaknesses. To achieve this, we extracted antibiotic use data from the IS ABV surveillance system and analysed prescription-level data from 2020 to 2023, applying seasonal adjustments using ARIMA time series modelling. We identified a significant decreasing trend in the number of prescriptions for companion and farm animals. In addition, the approximated reporting errors have decreased over time, indicating improved accuracy in documenting antibiotic use by veterinarians. These advances highlight the system's effectiveness in improving data accuracy and in monitoring antibiotic management improvements in Swiss veterinary practices. By providing more reliable, timely data, IS ABV enables better monitoring of prescribing patterns and supports evidence-based decision-making. This enables the authorities to design targeted interventions and policies aimed at reducing unnecessary antibiotic use, thereby contributing to the fight against antimicrobial resistance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41159098/,10.1093/jacamr/dlaf199 10.1179/2047773215Y.0000000030 10.1101/cshperspect.a025197 10.3390/antibiotics12030487 10.3389/fvets.2020.00540 10.1093/biomet/65.2.297 10.18637/jss.v087.i11 10.17236/sat00192 10.1016/j.prevetmed.2023.106006 10.3389/fvets.2021.627894 10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.07.016 10.1016/j.prevetmed.2024.106291

41156628,A Novel PCR Panel for Bacterial Detection in Lower Respiratory Tract Infections: A Comparative Study with Culture Results.,"Kömeç S, Durmuş MA, Ceylan AN, Korkusuz R",2025,"Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)","Lower respiratory tract (LRT) infections require rapid and accurate diagnosis. While bacterial culture remains the gold standard, multiplex PCR (mPCR) enables faster and more sensitive detection of multiple pathogens. This study evaluates the Bio-Speedy mPCR panel for 18 bacteria in comparison to conventional culture. A total of 100 LRT samples were analyzed. Complete concordance between the methods was observed in 85% of samples, with mPCR detecting pathogens slightly more frequently (62% vs. 53%). Discrepancies were primarily due to prior antibiotic therapy, low bacterial loads, colonization, or pathogens not included in the PCR panel. The sensitivity and specificity of mPCR were 79.3% and 96.8%, respectively, with negative agreement at 98.9% and positive agreement at 57.0%. Considering culture-negative but clinically relevant PCR-positive results, the sensitivity improved to 98.1% and the positive agreement to 86.7%. mPCR offers early pathogen detection, enabling timely therapy and potentially improving outcomes, particularly in intensive care settings. While culture remains indispensable for viable pathogen identification, combining mPCR with conventional methods provides complementary information, particularly when prior antibiotic use or the presence of fastidious pathogens may compromise culture results. Careful consideration of cost, patient population, and clinical context is recommended for optimal implementation of mPCR panels.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41156628/,10.3390/pathogens14101017 10.1086/513953 10.1164/rccm.200405-644ST 10.1128/JCM.02013-19 10.3390/diagnostics15040469 10.1038/s41598-022-15543-6 10.3390/antibiotics13090805 10.1128/JCM.37.1.1-7.1999 10.3390/diagnostics15081044 10.1371/journal.pone.0110566 10.1093/cid/cix101 10.1038/s41598-021-03741-7 10.1128/JCM.01028-14 10.3389/fcimb.2024.1426200 10.1186/s13613-014-0035-7 10.1186/s12890-019-0894-7 10.1016/j.jmii.2019.10.009 10.1186/s13054-020-03102-2 10.1007/s00508-021-01990-0 10.1007/s10096-021-04259-6 10.1007/s10096-019-03526-x 10.1016/j.ijid.2022.05.052 10.1213/ANE.0000000000004072 10.1186/s12879-024-09028-2 10.1016/j.cmi.2015.05.004

41150663,Participatory process to design community-driven solutions for reducing antibiotic use in chicken production in Vietnam.,"Bâtie C, Nam LH, Phuong AT, Pham TT, Molia S, Duc PP, Goutard F",2025,PloS one,"International organizations emphasize the urgent need to reduce antibiotic use to combat antimicrobial resistance, including in livestock farming. Technical, regulatory, and awareness-raising strategies exist, but they often fail due to a misalignment with farmers' realities. We hypothesize that actively engaging communities in the design of solutions will more effectively reduce antibiotic usage. We have therefore adapted and applied the ImpresS ex ante approach (impact of research in the South), to co-design solutions with stakeholders from the chicken and veterinary value chain at a local level in Vietnam. Eighteen participants (chicken farmers, drug sellers' representatives, public and private veterinarians, a chicken retailer, and academic staff), working at the communal, district, or provincial level, were involved in three half-day workshops organized in Thai Nguyen province in April 2022. Through this participatory process, participants collectively envisioned a 10-year future with reduced antibiotic use in chicken farms. They identified barriers including the lack of outlets for organic meat products, lack of knowledge and awareness of biosecurity and organic farming, low compliance of small-scale farms with biosecurity, and lack of science and technology related to alternative products. Participants decided to address ""knowledge gaps"" barrier. They have designed two strategies to improve the training of farmers and drug sellers, so that it is closer to the chicken value chain realities and reaches a greater audience. In this study, we identify systemic barriers to reducing antibiotic use, while recommending practical solutions. We also advocate the need to include locally-developed solutions in the national action plan on antimicrobial resistance in Vietnam and to involve policy-makers in participatory processes to design effective strategies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41150663/,10.1371/journal.pone.0335184 10.1111/zph.12193 10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.105261 10.1016/S0140-6736(15)00473-0 10.1136/bmjopen-2020-041418 10.1016/j.prevetmed.2015.01.010 10.1016/j.prevetmed.2015.01.018 10.21825/vdt.v87i4.16066 10.4236/ojas.2022.123034 10.3201/eid2710.210076 10.1136/bmj.j3544 10.1017/S1751731116001828 10.3389/fvets.2021.558973 10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.104611 10.3389/fvets.2021.584593 10.1093/jac/dkz233 10.3402/iee.v6.30978 10.1371/journal.ppat.1010537 10.3389/fpubh.2017.00020 10.3389/fvets.2021.646458 10.1371/journal.pone.0277487 10.1016/j.vas.2018.04.001 10.1371/journal.pone.0290296 10.3389/fsufs.2021.784500 10.1111/zph.12165 10.3390/antibiotics7030075 10.1371/journal.pone.0250082 10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.105292 10.1093/jacamr/dlad146 10.1016/j.prevetmed.2022.105731 10.24072/pcjournal.512 10.3138/cjpe.230 10.1016/j.prevetmed.2024.106226 10.1016/j.prevetmed.2023.106025 10.3389/fvets.2020.612993 10.1371/journal.pone.0223115 10.3168/jds.2006-607 10.1093/jac/dky100 10.1093/jacamr/dlab150 10.20870/productions-animales.2022.35.4.7340 10.1111/1746-692x.12445 10.1186/s12961-018-0337-6 10.1111/j.1468-0009.2012.00665.x 10.3389/fvets.2020.532763 10.1016/j.envsci.2019.08.017 10.1080/17535069.2019.1576216 10.1007/s13520-021-00128-9 10.3917/set.035.0090 10.1016/j.onehlt.2015.09.001
41150395,Next-Generation Sequencing Reveals Field Strain Dynamics and PRRSV-2 Clearance in Gilts When Using Tylvalosin During MLV Vaccination.,"Wu W, Gao X, Gao J, Lai Z, Deng X, Zhang J, Zhou Q, Zhou L",2025,Vaccines,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes significant economic losses for the global swine industry. Gilt immunization using modified live virus (MLV) vaccines is crucial for herd stability, but it is complicated by frequent mixed infections of PRRSV strains on farm. This study monitored the administration of tylvalosin during a PRRSV-2 MLV (TJM) immunization program, focusing on viral dynamics and immune responses in gilts naturally exposed to co-circulating classical (GD240101) and highly pathogenic like (HP-PRRSV-like, GD240102) PRRSV strains. The animal study was approved by the Laboratory Animal Ethical Committee of China Agricultural University. One hundred gilts were randomized into control and tylvalosin groups ( In this field trial where tylvalosin was used, a shorter duration of PRRSV viremia and saliva shedding was observed to compare with controls. NGS analysis showed accelerated vaccine strain (TJM) clearance in the tylvalosin group (by week 3 vs. week 9 in control). Field strain dynamics were also altered, showing a faster decline in the tylvalosin group. Antibody response uniformity was altered, with lower coefficient of variation (CV) for PRRSV and CSFV observed following tylvalosin usage. In gilts receiving tylvalosin for the management of bacterial pathogens during a PRRSV MLV immunization program, it was associated with accelerated viral clearance and enhanced systemic immune response uniformity under mixed-infection field conditions.

41150080,Veterinarians' Perspectives on the Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Dashboard: A Survey of Needs and Preferences to Inform Development.,"Pellissery AJ, Denagamage T, Pedersen M, Kariyawasam S",2025,Veterinary sciences,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant global threat to human and animal health, necessitating robust surveillance and stewardship tools. While existing systems address aspects of veterinary AMR, a comprehensive, user-centric dashboard for U.S. veterinarians remains a critical unmet need. This study aimed to identify U.S. veterinarians' preferences and perceived needs for such a dashboard, to help guide its design and development. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between January and March 2024, targeting U.S. veterinarians through professional channels. The survey instrument captured demographics, experiences with existing tools, preferences for data types and visualizations, desired technical specifications, and open-ended feedback. Of the 677 respondents, a near-unanimous consensus (over 75%) emerged on the importance of functionalities like antimicrobial stewardship education, off-label use guidance, surveillance data, and empirical treatment support. Over 70% expressed comfort sharing aggregated geographic and de-identified animal data. A strong preference was observed for making the dashboard accessible by veterinary colleges (78.87%), diagnostic laboratories (72.61%), and federal agencies (USDA: 71.47%, CDC: 66.67%, FDA: 62.11%), indicating a desire for a collaborative, authoritative system. The findings provide a robust foundation for developing a U.S. veterinary AMR dashboard. Future phases should adopt an iterative, user-centered design, incorporating qualitative research with diverse stakeholders and piloting a prototype with preferred institutional partners. This approach will ensure a trusted, sustainable tool that effectively translates surveillance data into actionable insights for improved animal and public health.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41150080/,10.3390/vetsci12100940 10.1016/S0140-6736(24)00876-6 10.1016/S2542-5196(23)00278-4 10.2460/ajvr.23.12.0294 10.1007/s11259-025-10752-6 10.1089/vbz.2023.0167 10.3390/antibiotics12030487 10.3389/fvets.2022.1068406 10.1093/ofid/ofy346 10.12688/wellcomeopenres.21010.4 10.1136/vr.106.12.260 10.1002/vetr.477 10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.4.2001359 10.1128/aac.01657-24 10.3389/fpubh.2024.1411962 10.2460/JAVMA.21.09.0431

Pediatric antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) face implementation challenges, often relying on adult-based guidelines and limited pediatric-specific evidence. This study aimed to identify and prioritize the most critical areas for pediatric ASP intervention development through a structured, multi-round Delphi consensus process with experts in antimicrobial stewardship and infectious diseases. A four-round modified Delphi process was conducted to identify and prioritize key pediatric ASP interventions. Experts in antimicrobial stewardship and infectious diseases were recruited through an existing clinical trial. Using an iterative survey and in-person discussions, experts provided input on priority areas, which were thematically grouped and refined across rounds. Structured feedback supported real-time refinement and consensus-building. Twenty experts participated in the process, generating 25 priority items in Round 1 through open-ended responses. These were narrowed to seven key priorities through structured voting and discussion. The final items were clustered into three intersecting themes: Care Settings, Prescriptions, and Strategies. Care Settings focused on high-impact areas such as outpatient clinics and intensive care units, where misuse is common and/or care is complex. The prescriptions theme prioritized shorter durations and narrow-spectrum agents. The strategy theme highlighted the need for outcome-based metrics, improved diagnostic stewardship, and routine tracking of patient outcomes to guide and assess stewardship efforts. This expert consensus identified key priorities for pediatric ASPs, providing a foundation for future interventions.

41148697,Impact of Antimicrobial-Resistant Bacterial Pneumonia on In-Hospital Mortality and Length of Hospital Stay: A Retrospective Cohort Study in Spain.,"Oterino-Moreira I, Pérez-Encinas M, Candel-González FJ, Lorenzo-Martínez S",2025,"Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)","Antimicrobial resistance is a major global health threat. This study aimed to assess the impact of antimicrobial-resistant bacterial pneumonia on in-hospital mortality and length of hospital stay in Spain using a large, nationally representative cohort. A retrospective cohort study that used data from Spain's Registry of Specialized Health Care Activity (RAE-CMBD) between 2017 and 2022. Hospitalized adults with bacterial pneumonia were included. Hospitalization episodes with bacterial antimicrobial resistance, defined according to ICD-10-CM codes for antimicrobial resistance (Z16.1, Z16.2), were analyzed versus hospitalization episodes without these codes. Multivariate logistic regression models, adjusted for potential confounders (e.g., age, comorbidity, intensive care unit admission) and sensitivity analyses (Poisson regression and propensity score matching test), were performed. Of the 116,901 eligible hospitalizations, 6017 (5.15%) involved antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Patients with antimicrobial-resistant bacterial pneumonia were older (median 75 vs. 72 years), had greater comorbidity (Elixhauser-van Walraven index: 8 vs. 5), and were more frequently admitted to the intensive care unit (22% vs. 14%). Crude in-hospital mortality was higher in the antimicrobial resistance group (18.46% vs. 10.05%,  Antimicrobial resistance is associated with longer hospital stays and an up to 50% higher risk of mortality. Despite the implementation of control policies in place over the past decade, policymakers must strengthen AMR surveillance and ensure adequate resource allocation. Clinicians, in turn, must reinforce antimicrobial stewardship and incorporate rapid diagnostic tools to minimize the impact of antimicrobial resistance on patient outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41148697/,10.3390/antibiotics14101006 10.1016/s1473-3099(13)70318-9 10.1093/cid/cix411 10.1056/NEJMoa1500245 10.1136/thoraxjnl-2013-203384 10.1186/s41479-017-0041-2 10.1136/bmj.f7450 10.1038/s41598-021-95852-4 10.1016/S1473-3099(10)70258-9 10.1128/aac.01426-24 10.1093/ofid/ofae219 10.1017/ice.2017.83 10.1128/AAC.01041-09 10.1002/phar.2171 10.1159/000520644 10.1016/j.medcli.2022.10.015 10.1016/j.medin.2022.12.002 10.3390/ijerph191811262

We aimed to assess the frequency and the characterization of antimicrobial resistance patterns among NFGNR-causing HAIs isolated from neurosurgical patients with special reference to the aminoglycoside resistance. A cross-sectional study was conducted on the hospitalized neurosurgical patients at Fayoum University Surgical Hospital, Egypt. The demographic characteristics and clinical data of patients were reported. The HAI definition was used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). From 120 patients, one hundred and thirty-one samples were obtained and cultured on an appropriate media. NLFGNRs were identified using standard microbiological methods and VITEK2. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was evaluated using the disc diffusion method. PCR was used to detect the aminoglycosides-resistant genes. Simple descriptive statistical analysis for results was done using statistical software, SPSS version 24. The chi-square and Fisher's exact test for the bivariate relationship were performed. One hundred and forty-six strains were isolated. NFGNRs represented [63/146 (43.1%)]. The most frequent NFGNRs were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) (66.7%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) (33.3%). 63.5% of NFGNR were resistant to aminoglycosides. P. aeruginosa exhibited a higher rate of resistance to gentamicin (62%), amikacin (59.5%), and meropenem (57.1%). In addition, A. baumannii was resistant to gentamicin (76.1%), amikacin (62%), and meropenem, ceftazidime (57.1%) for both. armA gene was the most detected aminoglycoside resistance gene (97.7%), followed by aac(3')-IIa (59.1%). We reported a high prevalence of NFGNRs (43.1%) causing HAIs among neurosurgical patients with increased antibiotic resistance for gentamicin. This makes a significant challenge for continued surveillance of antibiotic resistance and the improvement of the antimicrobial stewardship program to lower the frequency of NFGNR infections among neurosurgical patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41146018/,10.1186/s12866-025-04422-5

Community health workers (CHWs) are key actors in infection management and health promotion; however, their involvement in antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) remains unclear. This study aims to assess CHWs' roles in AMS, examine their training and support, and evaluate outcomes regarding antibiotic use and resistance. A scoping review was conducted to explore the roles, education, training and antimicrobial-related outcomes of CHWs. The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines, with the protocol registered in Open Science Framework. Databases including PubMed, EMBASE and CINAHL were searched for studies published in English and Spanish. A narrative synthesis was applied to the identified articles, with the Integrated Quality Criteria for the Review of Multiple Study Designs and Quality Assessment Tool for Studies with Diverse Designs tools employed to assess the risk of bias. Eight studies were identified, conducted in Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Kenya. CHWs were involved in various AMS activities, such as infection prevention, detection and treatment of conditions such as pneumonia and gastrointestinal infections. CHWs contributed to health education, antibiotic prescription (when authorised) and improved adherence to guidelines. Positive outcomes included reduced inappropriate antibiotic use and increased community awareness of AMR. However, the effectiveness of these interventions varied depending on the local context and resources. CHWs play an important role in promoting responsible antibiotic use and addressing AMR, particularly in underserved settings. Strengthening their training, expanding selected roles and responsibilities and improving support mechanisms should be considered to enhance their potential contribution to AMS programmes.

Antiviral stewardship, particularly as it pertains to cytomegalovirus (CMV), has been most extensively studied. This review outlines the history and development of stewardship interventions in the solid organ transplant population with a focus on antiviral stewardship of CMV. Obstacles and proposed solutions to these obstacles from the vantage point of the UW Health experience are shared. Proposed future applications of the antiviral stewardship framework and structure are discussed. A systematic review of English language studies published since 2000 was performed. Search terms included solid organ transplant, antimicrobial stewardship, antiviral stewardship, post-transplant viral infections, and cytomegalovirus. Antimicrobial stewardship has a role in the immunocompromised host, and CMV antiviral stewardship is a unique application in solid organ transplant. Utilization of this initiative can improve outcomes related to CMV, particularly in the high-risk population providing a proactive, dedicated effort with a well-established infrastructure for effective surveillance after prophylaxis. Targeted quality improvement initiatives can further personalize the initiative to address issues unique to each transplant center.

The Arwain complex intervention within Wales established peer networks of 'Veterinary Prescribing Champions' (VPCs) within and between Welsh veterinary practices to facilitate AMS training, support and activity. This study evaluates AMS goal setting and implementation within continuously engaged Arwain veterinary practices ( Descriptive quantitative analysis of Practice Action Plans (2020, 2024) and self-reported data on Action Plan implementation (2024), combined with qualitative analysis of participant interviews (2023) and participatory workshop feedback (2024) on challenges to implementing change, offer insight on the focus, achievements and implementation of AMS within the Arwain complex intervention. VPCs focused on behaviour-led (practice team/farm client) and structural (farm/practice-focused) changes. All practices reported at least one change goal initiated, with the majority (73%) reporting at least one fully implemented change. AMS implementation challenges included practical and cultural considerations of veterinary practices, the complexities of delivering AMS within inter-professional teams, the situated complexity of AMS on farm and the geographic, economic, regulatory, epidemiological and attitudinal factors implicit in the practice 'outer setting'. The Arwain complex intervention led to successful implementation of AMS changes across participating practices, with varying complexity, abstractness and completeness.

Incidence rates of SSI are high in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with evidence of surge in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in these regions. This mini review aimed to collect and analyze existing data on SSI incidence and the associated AMR in LMICs to address some concerns about causes and control strategies. MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, AMED, Biosis, and CINAHL were all searched for this study until June 8, 2025. We included all studies comparing disparities in surgical site infections and related antimicrobial resistance in low- and middle-income countries. The overall SSI incidence in LMICs is higher than in high-income countries . The intertwined relationship between SSI and the rising AMR burden further complicates the issue. The emergence of AMR is driven by inappropriate antibiotic use, poor regulatory oversight and stewardship, inadequate healthcare infrastructure, economic limitations that result in incomplete or informal treatments, weak surveillance systems, and environmental contamination from hospitals, agriculture, and wastewater. Vaccination, sanitation and hygiene, infection control, education, alternative therapies consideration of, antimicrobial stewardship, and prevention, are strategies to prevent and reduce the development of AMR. AMR is a dire global problem that requires immediate action to combat its spread. Effective AMR surveillance from a ""One Health"" viewpoint is needed in LMICs to map and track the spread of resistance.

The growing challenge of antibiotic resistance is a matter of concern, driven by frequent misuse of antimicrobial agents and limited awareness among healthcare professionals. This study aimed to assess the level of antibiotic resistance awareness across diverse medical professionals in Kerala, India, and to identify demographic and contextual influences that affect awareness and stewardship practices. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 345 healthcare professionals, including doctors, dentists, nurses, and pharmacists across Kerala. Participants completed a validated 23-item Antibiotic Resistance Awareness Scale, supplemented with modules on demographics, formal training, and workplace factors. Data were analyzed to evaluate predictors of awareness scores. Participants demonstrated moderate to high overall AMR awareness (mean score 73.9 ± 10.5), with the highest scores among physicians (75.8) and the lowest among nurses (69.7, p < 0.001). Significant disparities were observed by profession, training level, and practice setting. Only 23.5% reported formal AMR training, with pharmacists showing the highest training participation (44%). Males scored higher than females (mean difference 2.3, p=0.046), and practitioners in tertiary care had superior knowledge compared to those in primary care (mean difference 3.4, p=0.008). Training participation showed a positive but nonsignificant association with awareness (p=0.074). While overall awareness of antibiotic resistance among Kerala's healthcare professionals was good, substantial disparities exist, especially among nurses and those lacking formal AMR training.

41141168,Emerging Role of Emergency Physicians in Antimicrobial Stewardship.,Taniguchi H,2025,Cureus,"The emergency department (ED) is increasingly recognized as a critical site for antimicrobial stewardship, where most initial antibiotic decisions occur, and emergency physicians (EPs), previously regarded as primarily focused on empiric treatment, are now emerging as leaders. Policy milestones, including accreditation standards and national guidelines, have catalyzed this transition, yet physician roles remain heterogeneous, and evidence on long-term outcomes is limited. Drawing on English-language literature, including intervention studies, descriptive reports, and policy documents, this editorial highlights how EPs contribute through guideline development, audit and feedback, culture follow-up, formulary oversight, rapid diagnostics, and educational initiatives. Evidence consistently shows improvements in prescribing appropriateness, reduced use of broad-spectrum agents, and faster optimization without compromising safety. However, barriers such as time pressure, professional culture, role ambiguity, and limited resources remain persistent. Importantly, the leadership of EPs has proven central in overcoming these obstacles, especially when supported by institutional commitment and integrated workflows. Their engagement is not only improving immediate prescribing practices but also represents a critical frontline defense against antimicrobial resistance and multidrug-resistant organisms. Looking forward, formalizing physician leadership, embedding stewardship in emergency medicine training, and building ED-specific data systems are essential to sustain safe and effective antibiotic use.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41141168/,10.7759/cureus.93058
41141052,From Womb to Tomb: A Life-Course Perspective on the Origins of Non-communicable Diseases.,"Dev A, Patra R, Kale SA, James Marianadin LP, Mohanty SS, Benny J",2025,Cureus,"Chronic illnesses such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory disorders are leading causes of death globally. Although often considered adult-onset, growing evidence links their origins to early developmental exposures, including prenatal, neonatal, and early childhood stages. This review adopts a life-course perspective to examine how factors such as maternal undernutrition, gestational diabetes, low birth weight, early antibiotic use, suboptimal infant feeding, adverse childhood experiences, and childhood obesity influence long-term disease risk through mechanisms like epigenetic modifications, immune and hormonal programming, and metabolic changes. The window from conception through the first two years is especially critical for physiological programming. Evidence from cohort studies supports these associations, though findings are primarily drawn from high-income countries, limiting generalizability to more vulnerable settings. Despite awareness of early-life influence, most prevention remains adult-focused. There is a need for intergenerational strategies spanning preconception to early childhood, alongside school-based interventions and population-level policies. Mobile health technologies and personalized risk profiling offer scalable, cost-effective approaches to early intervention, particularly in underserved communities. The ""womb-to-tomb"" model emphasizes the urgency of investing in early health to achieve sustainable, equitable prevention of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) throughout life.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41141052/,10.7759/cureus.93168

This practice can lead to unnecessary procedures with low diagnostic yield, added morbidity, and increased healthcare burden. Objective To evaluate the local practice regarding rigid cystoscopy and biopsy for RPs and to assess the impact of a targeted departmental intervention. Methods This was a single-center, retrospective, two-cycle quality improvement audit at a UK district general hospital. Cycle 1 included all flexible cystoscopies between March and June 2024 and Cycle 2 between November 2024 and February 2025. Data collected included demographics, cystoscopy indication, smoking history, urinary tract infection (UTI) status, biopsy decisions, histology, antibiotic use, and relook outcomes. Following Cycle 1, an intervention was introduced comprising mandatory red-patch image capture, consultant review prior to biopsy listing, and structured teaching on morphology, risk stratification, and benign mimics. Results In Cycle 1, 63 RP cases were identified; 37 (58.7%) underwent biopsy, with three malignancies detected (8.1%). Relook cystoscopy was performed in 26 patients, with resolution in 20 (76.9%); of six persistent cases, three underwent biopsy (one malignancy) and three were observed safely. In Cycle 2, 73 cases were identified; 23 (31.5%) underwent biopsy, with one malignancy (4.3%). Relook was performed in 48 patients, with resolution in 32 (66.7%); of 16 persistent cases, eight underwent biopsy (one malignancy) and eight were managed conservatively. Across both cycles, all malignancies occurred in patients >60 years; three of four had a smoking history, and one coincided with proven UTI. Antibiotic prescribing remained frequent, including in patients without culture-proven infection.  Conclusion In our center, a consultant-led, image-supported, risk-stratified pathway appeared to reduce unnecessary rigid cystoscopy and biopsy requests for RPs, with no observed delays in cancer detection during the audit period. Most lesions resolved spontaneously or after UTI treatment, and several persistent but low-risk patches were managed safely without biopsy. However, with only four malignant cases identified, oncological safety cannot be definitively established, and these findings should be regarded as exploratory. This study is further limited by its single-center, retrospective design and small event rate. Future work should prioritize antibiotic stewardship, standardization of relook intervals, and evaluation of urine cytology in high-risk patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41141034/,10.7759/cureus.93060

The aim of this study was to explore clinicians' awareness of RDE, its perceived causes, and potential strategies to reduce its occurrence. A qualitative approach using focus groups was conducted with ICU nurses, examining their awareness of RDE, contributing factors, and ideas for prevention. Thematic analysis was used to identify key themes and subthemes from the data. Twenty-seven participants participated in four focus groups over four mandatory training days. Clinicians' experiences with RDEs in the ICU were categorised into three main themes: (i) Awareness and perception of RDEs; (ii) Potential causes of RDE, including knowledge gaps, workload pressures, and inconsistent double-checking and documentation practices; and (iii) Proposed solutions to minimise RDEs including enhanced education, standardised protocols, and improved documentation. ICU nurses demonstrated limited prior awareness of RDE, with participants identifying multiple contributing factors including personal practice variability, drug characteristics, workload pressures, and reconstitution technique. Proposed solutions centred on targeted education, consistent double-checking and signing procedures, and concise, accessible checklists.

The study objective was to assess the impact of a shortened antibacterial surgical prophylaxis duration on post-operative acute kidney injury (AKI) in lung transplant recipients. This was an IRB approved, single pre-/post-test quasi-experiment of lung transplant recipients who received post-operative antibiotic prophylaxis from January 1, 2016-September 30, 2020 (pre-group) to October 1, 2020-March 31, 2025 (post-group). The intervention included modifying vancomycin (and cefepime) post-operative prophylaxis durations to 72 h; the previous prophylaxis standard included continuing vancomycin until chest tube removal. The primary endpoint was incidence of AKI, defined by the KDIGO criteria, while receiving post-operative vancomycin up to 14 days. Thirty-day secondary outcomes included surgical site infection (SSI), treatment of lower respiratory-tract infection, and isolation of multi-drug-resistant organisms (MDRO). Ninety patients were included-45 pre- and 45 post-intervention. Most patients were men (64.4%) and had a median (IQR) age of 63 (58-68) years. The most common indication for transplant was pulmonary fibrosis (37.8%). The incidence of 14-day AKI was reduced when comparing pre- and post-intervention groups (48.9% vs. 28.9%, p = 0.052), with no differences in SSI (2.2% vs. 2.2%, p = 1.0), treatment of lower respiratory tract infection (57.8% vs. 73.3%, p = 0.120), and isolation of MDRO (15.6% vs. 13.3%, p = 0.764).

Overuse and inappropriate prescription of antifungal (AF) agents have been reported in pediatrics, leading not only to an increase in adverse events and toxicities but also to the development of AF resistance. AF stewardship practices as part of broader antimicrobial stewardship programs are crucial for improving outcomes and reducing AF overuse and associated costs. This review has two main objectives: to summarize the published data on prescription patterns of AF agents in pediatrics and to describe the current state of pediatric AF stewardship programs worldwide, providing suggestions for their implementation. Given the significant burden of invasive fungal infections in vulnerable pediatric populations, identification of actions to improve AF stewardship practices in real-life clinical settings is essential.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41138041/,10.1007/s11046-025-01011-y 10.1016/S1473-3099(23)00692-8 10.1038/s41579-023-00861-x 10.3390/microorganisms12010145 10.1111/j.1469-0691.2009.02909.x 10.3390/cancers15133529 10.1097/INF.0000000000002394 10.1093/jpids/pix046 10.3389/fmed.2024.1386161 10.1086/655698 10.3233/PIC-14108 10.1542/peds.2009-3412 10.1055/s-0032-1329688 10.1097/01.inf.0000078159.53132.40 10.3390/jof2010005 10.7573/dic.2023-9-2 10.2147/IDR.S124918 10.1186/s12879-018-3100-2 10.1542/peds.2004-1605 10.1542/peds.2008-2055 10.1093/jpids/piy009 10.1016/j.jinf.2012.08.003 10.1128/AAC.04109-14 10.1017/ice.2017.40 10.1097/INF.0000000000002463 10.1093/jac/dky389 10.1097/QCO.0b013e32834e0680 10.1080/21505594.2016.1226721 10.1016/j.cmi.2015.01.013 10.1093/jac/dkv040 10.1093/jpids/piaf081 10.1097/MPH.0000000000003070 10.1097/INF.0000000000004445 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07844.x 10.1182/blood.V120.21.4278.4278 10.1186/s12879-018-3410-4 10.5863/1551-6776-19.3.196 10.1017/ash.2022.338 10.1007/s10096-011-1315-x 10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100727 10.1007/s40121-018-0203-4 10.5694/mja13.00154 10.1093/mmy/myab037 10.1097/INF.0000000000003402 10.1016/j.jgar.2018.08.007 10.1186/s12879-021-05774-9 10.1097/INF.0000000000001746 10.1038/s41598-021-93421-3 10.5863/1551-6776-26.6.624 10.1017/ice.2020.306 10.1097/INF.0000000000003704 10.1016/j.jinf.2020.01.002 10.1186/s13052-022-01306-6 10.1016/j.anpede.2023.09.012 10.1017/ice.2023.129 10.1016/j.jgar.2023.10.017 10.1016/j.jpeds.2020.06.008 10.1093/infdis/jiaa394 10.1097/INF.0000000000003967 10.1093/cid/ciw592 10.1093/cid/ciab928 10.1016/j.eimc.2014.04.016 10.1093/cid/ciw118 10.1097/FTD.0000000000001067 10.1093/jacamr/dlab111 10.1093/jacamr/dlae058 10.1111/tid.13928 10.1177/1078155218816779 10.2217/fmb.15.99 10.1093/jac/dkaa409 10.1186/1748-5908-8-35 10.1016/j.cmi.2017.07.017 10.1093/ofid/ofac234
41132513,Current Evidence and Gaps for Outpatient Respiratory Tract Infection Diagnostics: A Call to Action.,"Arena CJ, Frost HM, Willis P, Raux B, Wungwattana M, Veve MP",2025,Open forum infectious diseases,"Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are underrepresented in outpatient settings, where antibiotic use and overprescribing are common. Upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) account for 30% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions, highlighting the need for enhanced ASP efforts. Rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) has important value in management of outpatient URIs, such as pharyngitis, and can lead to optimized prescribing practices and significant reductions in unnecessary antimicrobial use by facilitating accurate diagnoses. Implementation of outpatient RDTs is hindered by a lack of streamlined workflows, resources, and ASPs. These gaps often lead to suboptimal use of RDTs and misinterpretation of or failure to act on the results. Future RDT evaluations should include strategies to curtail unnecessary antibiotics and expand point-of-care testing (POCT) to additional settings to enhance antimicrobial stewardship. This paper reviews outpatient RDT initiatives, and specifically POCT, in URIs. Additionally, we highlight the need for more evidence demonstrating the impact on clinical outcomes and antibiotic prescribing with the implementation of RDTs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41132513/,10.1093/ofid/ofaf519

In Palestine, dispensing antibiotics without prescription remains common despite legal restrictions, but limited qualitative evidence exists on pharmacists' perspectives. The objective was to explore community pharmacists' practices, perceptions, and challenges in dispensing antibiotics without prescription in Palestine. This qualitative descriptive study used semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 14 licensed pharmacists from urban, semi-urban, and rural districts of the West Bank, conducted between January and March 2025. Purposive sampling ensured variation in gender, experience, and setting. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed thematically using Braun and Clarke's framework. Six major themes were identified. Participants were aware of the legal prohibition but cited weak enforcement. Daily non-prescription requests were common, especially during seasonal illnesses, driven by prior positive experiences, social recommendations, and inability to afford doctor visits. Symptom-based dispensing was used in perceived 'clear cases,' influenced by customer pressure and business competition. Public misconceptions-such as believing antibiotics treat viral infections-were widespread, with frequent incomplete dosing and reuse of leftovers. Pharmacists attempted patient education but faced time and receptiveness barriers, and often experienced ethical conflict. Regulatory oversight was minimal; participants recommended stricter inspections, public awareness campaigns, and collaborative practice models. Non-prescription antibiotic dispensing in Palestine is shaped by patient demand, economic pressures, and weak regulation. Addressing these drivers requires strengthened enforcement, targeted public education, professional training, and integration of pharmacists into AMR stewardship to safeguard public health. These findings highlight the need for actionable reforms in pharmacy practice and national policy, including stricter regulatory oversight and pharmacist-led public education, to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use and strengthen AMR containment strategies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41132365/,10.1093/jacamr/dlaf195 10.3390/healthcare11131946 10.1177/2042098614554919 10.1186/s12889-015-2109-3 10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02724-0 10.1186/s12889-019-7796-8 10.1021/envhealth.4c00094 10.3390/antibiotics11060733 10.21037/jphe-23-184 10.1186/s13756-024-01417-1 10.3390/antibiotics9090597 10.2147/PPA.S384671 10.59049/2790-0231.10.1.2264 10.30574/ijsra.2024.13.2.2377 10.1155/2023/2294048 10.1093/jac/dkz348 10.1186/2050-6511-15-6 10.1186/s13756-019-0487-2

Inappropriate antimicrobial prescription and use exacerbate AMR. This study assesses the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) toward AMR and antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) among pharmacy healthcare workers involved in antimicrobial dispensing across 28 African countries. An online survey was distributed to collect data on KAP from HCWs who dispense antimicrobials in African countries. Responses were scored, and a 70% cut-off mark was used to differentiate between good and poor KAP. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with good or poor KAPs. A total of 2567 responses (40%) were received, of which 908 were from pharmacy HCWs who dispensed antibiotics in 28 countries. Of the 908 eligible respondents, 71.3% had good knowledge of AMR and AMS, 59.9% displayed good attitudes towards the burden of AMR and appropriate prescription of antimicrobials and 41.6% displayed good practices related to AMS. Patient demands and influence from pharmaceutical companies were among the factors that influenced the dispensing of antibiotics. In multivariable logistic regression, licensed pharmacists were more likely to have good knowledge of AMR than pharmacy technicians (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.78; 95% CI 1.64 to 1.93). Male dispensers were less likely to have a positive attitude towards AMR than female dispensers (aOR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.94). Moreover, dispensers affiliated with public health facilities demonstrated better AMR practices than those affiliated with private facilities. Overall, good AMR knowledge status was significantly associated with positive attitudes (χ²=97.1, p<0.001) and practices (χ²=6.5, p<0.05) of AMR. This study revealed limited understanding of AMR among dispensers without formal pharmaceutical training and a positive association between good knowledge and positive attitudes and practices.

Higher KAP scores were associated with education, employment, urban residence, and access to water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure. Misconceptions persisted across all groups, however, particularly regarding AMU in healthy animals and personal AMR risk. While surveyed participants demonstrated generally good KAP, gaps remain.

However, they pose significant public health risks by facilitating the transmission of zoonotic pathogens and contributing to the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). High human-animal interactions, poor hygiene, and unregulated antimicrobial use contribute to the emergence and spread of resistant microorganisms. Despite these risks, the role of open markets in the spread of zoonotic pathogens and AMR has received limited attention. Thus, this review explores the possible mechanisms by which AMR may spread in open markets, the role of microbial genetic exchanges in the emergence of new resistant strains in these settings, and the zoonotic risks associated with the live animal trade. It also discusses strategies and future directions to mitigate these issues, emphasizing the urgency of taking the required One Health actions to minimize the spread of AMR and the zoonotic infections globally. These actions should include robust surveillance, regulatory measures, public health initiatives along with advocacy and training, all crucial for protecting global health.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41127627/,10.1016/j.onehlt.2025.101228 10.1016/j.tim.2021.02.007 10.2196/11477 10.1016/S2542-5196(21)00112-1 10.4178/epih.e2023097 10.46784/E-AVM.V17I1.361 10.3389/fmicb.2019.02618 10.1016/S2542-5196(18)30186-4 10.5367/OA.2011.0056 10.3201/eid1012.040707 10.1016/j.foodcont.2009.05.011 10.4315/JFP-20-406 10.1590/1678-4685-GMB-2020-0355 10.3390/microorganisms8091405 10.3390/su141912806 10.1177/2632010X241300679 10.1016/j.ijid.2020.05.091 10.1007/s42398-021-00165-x 10.3389/fvets.2020.582743 10.1007/s10460-019-09987-2 10.1177/0276146799192004 10.1006/viro.1999.9820 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60903-4 10.1016/j.coesh.2021.100310 10.3390/v14122756 10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113358 10.1016/j.ijheh.2019.07.007 10.3389/fvets.2024.1340548 10.3390/su14020589 10.1371/journal.pone.0095430 10.1007/s10393-013-0885-8 10.56557/upjoz/2024/v45i33898 10.1111/j.1863-2378.2008.01222.x 10.3390/pathogens8040191 10.22034/jzd.2022.14378 10.3390/antibiotics10010068 10.3390/pathogens9030202 10.3390/microorganisms11030583 10.3390/microbiolres14010011 10.1080/01652176.2022.2086718 10.1007/s10068-023-01406-x 10.21608/ejabf.2024.378875 10.1093/fqsafe/fyac013 10.3390/biomedicines12071457 10.3201/eid3009.240135 10.3906/sag-2004-127 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)15329-9 10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029 10.1179/2047773213Y.0000000103 10.3389/fvets.2024.1513123 10.1016/j.jiph.2024.102591 10.1152/ajplung.00354.2014 10.1093/bmb/ldw005 10.1089/vbz.2008.0167 10.1002/jmv.25390 10.1016/j.coviro.2014.12.007 10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2020.108986 10.3389/fmicb.2023.1239079 10.1016/S1386-6532(02)00268-8 10.1016/j.coviro.2017.09.004 10.4314/sokjvs.v16i2.8 10.1146/annurev.ento.44.1.51 10.1101/2025.03.24.25324509 10.30918/irjmms.81.20.013 10.1186/s12879-018-3470-5 10.3390/ijerph17041346 10.1007/s00203-017-1393-y 10.1155/2020/4674235 10.14202/vetworld.2017.286-292 10.2903/j.efsa.2008.765 10.3390/foods11192966 10.2147/IDR.S428837 10.3389/FMICB.2018.00362/BIBTEX 10.3390/foods14020253 10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0254465 10.1016/J.SCITOTENV.2016.06.208 10.1111/j.1863-2378.2010.01360.x 10.3390/tropicalmed4010054 10.1021/ACS.EST.2C00799 10.3390/md15060158 10.3389/fmicb.2022.928509 10.3390/antibiotics12030555 10.3389/fmicb.2015.01356 10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2012.05.021 10.4103/1658-631x.170883 10.2903/j.efsa.2013.3025 10.1371/journal.pone.0138173 10.1017/S0950268811001038 10.1002/FSN3.4723 10.1093/sumbio/qvae017 10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e39294 10.14202/vetworld.2022.2293-2301 10.1016/j.envint.2021.106836 10.1016/j.jiph.2019.03.017 10.3390/microorganisms7090344 10.3389/fmicb.2019.02892 10.1016/j.envint.2021.106927 10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2019.24.32.1900149 10.2217/fmb-2019-0053 10.3390/antibiotics10050539 10.2903/j.efsa.2022.7586 10.1007/s11356-023-28532-7 10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2023.110148 10.1016/j.onehlt.2025.101053 10.1016/j.gfs.2019.100325 10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2018.03.010 10.20546/ijcmas.2018.708.004 10.1093/jac/dkw481 10.3390/agriculture12020289 10.3349/YMJ.2024.0108 10.1016/j.foodres.2022.111376 10.1146/annurev-food-041715-033251 10.1071/MA24020 10.1016/j.cofs.2022.100882 10.3390/life4020217 10.1093/jacamr/dlz072 10.5455/jabet.2023.d161 10.3390/antibiotics12030523

However, excessive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics should be avoided. Implementing antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) in haematology units is challenging due to high infection-related risks, and data on interventions remain scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the safety of an AMS bundle on a haematology ward. A prospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary care centre among patients with high-risk (≥7 days) neutropenia. The AMS bundle consisted of replacing empirical meropenem with ceftazidime, and shortening treatment duration to 2 days in case of defervescence and negative blood cultures. Data on ICU admission, all-cause mortality, antimicrobial use and microorganisms identified were compared with a (retrospective) pre-intervention cohort. A total of 396 patients were included (206 pre-intervention, 190 post-intervention). Allogeneic stem cell transplantations increased from 21% pre-intervention to 37% post-intervention. There was no statistical difference in the adjusted composite endpoint of ICU admission and all-cause mortality [adjusted HR (aHR) 1.46; 95% CI, 0.76-2.81;  The AMS bundle led to a shift towards narrower-spectrum antibiotics, and reduced treatment duration and overall antibiotic use without a significant impact on the primary safety outcome.

MUEs can explore safety concerns, high costs, or inappropriate use associated with any medication, among other factors. This can offer a valuable opportunity for Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASPs) to promote stewardship goals, which often overlap with these concerns for specific antimicrobials. MUEs can also provide an avenue to promote interdisciplinary collaboration with targeted groups relevant to the ASP's goals as well as an opportunity to give trainees ownership of system-facing stewardship projects. Stewardship pharmacists may often have experience with leading this process as part of their training, but MUEs represent a gap in training for physicians.

We report the first known case of a previously healthy 1-year and 7-month-old boy who developed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) NSTI following peripheral venous catheter (PVC) insertion. The patient developed swelling and erythema at the PVC site. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) confirmed diffuse fascial inflammation consistent with NSTI, which guided the urgent decision for surgical intervention. Aggressive management with vancomycin, meropenem, and clindamycin, along with emergent, tissue-sparing surgical debridement, was initiated. The patient recovered uneventfully after 11 days, with minimal scarring and normal range of motion at 3-month follow-up. This case highlights a rare but serious complication of PVC insertion and emphasizes the need for vigilance in distinguishing between infectious and non-infectious PVC-related complications in children. The challenges in routine replacement practices, skin preparation protocols, and monitoring underscore the need for continuous improvement in clinical practices. Importantly, this case illustrates how imaging can play a decisive role in early diagnosis and surgical planning. The tissue-sparing debridement approach adopted represents a strategic departure from historical aggressive methods, aiming to preserve viable tissue while achieving infection control. We propose incorporating vigilant monitoring, optimal nurse-to-patient ratios, and pediatric-specific protocols to enhance early detection and reduce morbidity associated with NSTI. Infectious diseases consultation was involved in guiding antibiotic de-escalation, highlighting the importance of balancing early broad-spectrum coverage with antimicrobial stewardship.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41126165/,10.1186/s12887-025-06240-0

To improve rational prescribing, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed core prescribing indicators and the AWaRe antibiotic classification. Evidence from Afghanistan remains scarce, especially in outpatient settings. This cross-sectional prescription audit was conducted from June to December 2024 in six public and private hospitals in Kabul. Prescriptions were sampled from outpatient departments of internal medicine, pediatrics, surgery, and ENT. Of 623 prescriptions screened, 306 (49.1%) contained at least one antibiotic and were analyzed using WHO prescribing indicators and the AWaRe classification. Data were processed with SPSS v25. A total of 374 antibiotics were prescribed, with an average of 1.5 per prescription. The most common agents were ceftriaxone (19.9%), metronidazole (16.0%), ciprofloxacin (12.4%), and amoxicillin (11.4%). Generic prescribing accounted for 63.3%, while 42.7% of prescriptions included parenteral antibiotics. All antibiotics were from the National Essential Medicines List. AWaRe analysis showed Watch antibiotics (58.6%) predominated, while Access antibiotics (41.4%) were underused; no Reserve antibiotics were prescribed. No culture and sensitivity testing supported prescribing. Antibiotic prescribing in Kabul outpatient settings substantially exceeded WHO standards, with high reliance on broad-spectrum Watch-group agents, injectables, and non-generic formulations.

Periodic microbiology reports were available for 57.9%, hospital alcohol-based hand rubs consumption per 1000 bed-days in 42.1% and defined daily dose of antimicrobials per 100 bed-days in 55.3% hospitals with a significant difference between Northern and Southern regions (90.9% vs 22.2%; P = 0.006). Active monitoring of hand hygiene and contact isolation compliance was implemented in only half of the hospitals. Structured HAI surveillance systems were implemented in fewer than 20% of hospitals. Components on IPC implementation activity, such as no-touch sanitizing systems, checklist for environmental cleaning, informatic flags, bundles for pathogens revealed the lowest score. The appropriateness of antibiotic therapy prescribing was assessed in 73.7% of facilities. Only 42.1% of hospitals had budget goals. This survey provides a baseline assessment and identifies key barriers to the implementation of IPC programs across Italian acute care hospitals. The findings highlight priority areas for intervention and will inform the next phase of the INSIEME project, which aims to develop and implement tailored strategies that address the specific needs of healthcare workers and institutions nationwide.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41125745/,10.1038/s41598-025-20893-y

Antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs) are designed to optimize antibiotic use, but ideal strategies for implementing evidence-based guidelines remain unclear. We tested facilitation, a dynamic process where trained individuals support healthcare personnel in bridging evidence-practice gaps, as a promising strategy for the de-implementation of unnecessary postoperative antibiotics in healthcare. The OPerAtiC trial employed a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled design across nine hospitals to compare the effectiveness of two ASP-led strategies, specifically order set changes to align with antibiotic guidelines (baseline arm) and facilitation training (intervention arm). Facilitation workshops were informed by the i-PARIHS framework, emphasizing context analysis, evidence application, and recipient engagement; and were conducted remotely. Data were collected from 2019 to 2024, involving interviews with stewardship team members every two months. Data collected included proximal implementation outcomes of each ASP team member (acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness), intermediate outcomes (facilitation skill use) reported by the ASP team, and order set change completion rates. Proximal implementation outcomes for both strategies were rated high across all study phases, indicating strong baseline enthusiasm among participants (N = 30). Key facilitation skills-effective communication, conflict resolution, and data presentation-were pivotal for successful implementation. Most order set changes (76%) were completed post-facilitation, targeting various specialties and achieving reductions or eliminations in antibiotic use. Facilitation was associated with significantly more completed order sets targeting antibiotic reduction (p = 0.01), suggesting a potential pathway to improve the appropriateness of antibiotic use through implementation strategies. Facilitation is a valuable approach in refining ASP efforts, contributing to the successful reduction and de-implementation of unnecessary antibiotic use in children's hospitals. The study underscores the need for ongoing training and support for ASP teams to enhance their effectiveness in promoting appropriate antibiotic-prescribing practices. Future research should explore the long-term impacts of facilitation on antibiotic stewardship and patient outcomes.

Science. B,"The risk factors and role of mother‒child gut microbiota in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) remain unclear. We aimed to explore the clinical risk factors associated with PIBD, analyze the characteristics of gut microbiota of children and their mothers, and examine the correlation of the microbial composition in mother‒child pairs. We conducted a case-control study including children with PIBD and their mothers as the case group, as well as healthy children and their mothers as the control group. Questionnaires were used to collect information such as family illness history and maternal and early-life events. Fecal samples were collected from the children and mothers for microbiota 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing to analyze the composition and its potential association with PIBD. A total of 54 pairs of cases and 122 pairs of controls were recruited. A family history of autoimmune disease and antibiotic use during pregnancy were associated with an increased risk of PIBD, and a higher education level of the father was associated with a decreased risk of PIBD. Children with PIBD and mothers exhibited different gut microbiota compared to healthy children and mothers. Similarities were observed in the gut microbiota of mothers and children in the same groups. Some bacterial biomarkers of mothers discovered in this study had the power to predict PIBD in their offspring. PIBD is influenced by maternal risk factors and has unique gut microbiota characteristics. The mother‒child gut microbiota is closely related, suggesting the transmission and influence of the gut microbiota between mothers and children. This study highlights the potential pathogenesis of PIBD and provides a basis for developing targeted interventions. 在儿童炎症性肠病（PIBD）发病中，母子肠道菌群的作用及相关风险因素尚未明确。本研究旨在探究PIBD发病的临床危险因素，分析患儿与母亲的肠道菌群特征，并探讨二者肠道菌群的相关性。研究采用病例-对照设计，纳入54对PIBD患儿及其母亲作为病例组，122对健康儿童及其母亲作为对照组。通过问卷收集家族疾病史、围产期及生命早期事件等信息;采集两组儿童及母亲的粪便样本，进行微生物16S rRNA测序，分析肠道菌群组成及其与PIBD发病的潜在关联。结果显示，自身免疫病家族史、孕期抗生素使用与PIBD发病风险升高相关，而父亲学历较高则与PIBD发病风险降低相关。病例组母子的肠道菌群与对照组存在显著差异，且同组内母亲与子女的肠道菌群具有相似性。此外，母亲的肠道菌群生物标志物可预测其子女患PIBD的风险。综上，PIBD的发病受母源性危险因素影响，患者存在独特的肠道菌群特征;母子肠道菌群的密切关联提示二者间存在菌群传递与相互影响。本研究为阐明PIBD的潜在发病机制提供了依据，并为针对性干预措施的开发奠定了基础。.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41116208/,10.1631/jzus.B2400330 10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100884 10.1136/gutjnl-2022-327724 10.1038/nature09944 10.1128/mSystems.00164-16 10.3390/microorganisms10061231 10.1128/mSystems.00857-19 10.1038/nmeth.2276 10.1542/peds.2022-058037 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167034 10.1038/s41385-018-0085-5 10.1016/j.cmet.2023.03.003 10.1080/19490976.2024.2323231 10.1016/j.xcrm.2023.101124 10.1016/s0140-6736(23)02586-2 10.1080/19490976.2023.2192478 10.1038/s41587-020-0548-6 10.1016/j.cgh.2024.02.010 10.1093/bioinformatics/btr381 10.1016/j.chom.2018.06.005 10.1038/s41564-023-01559-9 10.7759/cureus.39466 10.3390/jpm10040243 10.3389/fcimb.2022.1015890 10.1038/s41575-023-00864-2 10.1186/s40168-018-0567-4 10.1093/ibd/izz225 10.1053/j.gastro.2021.12.282 10.1016/s0140-6736(23)00966-2 10.3748/wjg.v20.i5.1127 10.1111/1751-7915.14480 10.1053/j.gastro.2022.07.004 10.1016/j.chom.2024.04.020 10.1111/1751-2980.12909 10.1080/19490976.2021.1875796 10.1093/bioinformatics/btr507 10.23736/s0026-4806.19.06389-4 10.1038/s41579-022-00768-z 10.1128/cmr.00060-18 10.1080/19490976.2020.1802866 10.1038/nrgastro.2012.14 10.1016/j.gendis.2019.10.003 10.1136/gutjnl-2017-314352 10.1007/s11626-022-00691-w 10.1111/1462-2920.13316 10.1053/j.gastro.2019.04.016 10.1053/j.gastro.2019.11.294 10.1039/D1FO03131G 10.1038/s42255-022-00649-y 10.1128/iai.00814-08 10.1172/jci72334 10.1186/gb-2011-12-6-r60 10.1038/s41592-019-0431-x 10.3389/fphar.2023.1205323 10.3389/fimmu.2021.700995 10.1080/19490976.2023.2206505 10.1038/s41586-022-05620-1 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjac043 10.1016/j.tim.2019.07.010 10.3390/ijms231911210 10.3389/fcimb.2021.711884 10.1136/gutjnl-2022-328970 10.1681/asn.2022020189

The aim of the study is to comprehensively analyse the prevalence, risk factors, clinical implications and strategies to combat antibiotic resistance in sepsis. Methods include a systematic literature review and evaluation of the effectiveness of different approaches based on empirical evidence. Alarming levels of resistance to reserve-line antibiotics have been observed among Gram-negative pathogens in ICU. Irrational use of antibiotics, lack of adherence to infection control measures and limited implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programmes are key factors contributing to the development and spread of resistance. Infections caused by resistant pathogens are associated with increased mortality, risk of complications, longer hospitalization and higher treatment costs. This creates a situation where opportunities for effective antibiotic therapy become exhausted. Sepsis caused by resistant pathogens significantly complicates treatment and worsens prognosis, increasing the risk of complications and mortality. Overcoming the problem of antibiotic resistance requires a comprehensive approach that includes the development of new antibiotics, rational use of existing drugs, strengthening infection control measures, improving epidemiological surveillance and exploring alternative therapeutic strategies. Antibiotic stewardship programmes (ASPs), infection control measures and combined strategies have demonstrated the greatest effectiveness in combating the spread of resistance in ICU. This study contributes to the understanding of the magnitude of the antibiotic resistance problem and offers specific recommendations for improving clinical practice and health policy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41115031/,

Limited national-level data exist for Kazakhstan, where livestock farming is a major agricultural sector. This study aimed to evaluate antibiotic residues in meat and feed samples collected from across Kazakhstan and assess their implications for public health and food safety. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between December 2023 and March 2025 across 14 regions of Kazakhstan. A total of 1,026 meat samples (beef, horse, chicken, lamb, and pork) and 150 feed samples (succulent, coarse, concentrated) were collected from licensed facilities. Samples were processed under standard protocols and analyzed using the Evidence Investigator biochip system (Randox, UK), employing Antimicrobial Array I Ultra and Antimicrobial Array II Plus panels. Statistical analyses, including analysis of variance, were performed using International Business Machine Statistical Package for the Social Sciences v25, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Residual antibiotics were detected in all categories of meat and feed, with several concentrations exceeding permissible limits. Succulent feeds showed the highest contamination (streptomycin 86.43 ppb; quinolones 35.56 ppb). Among meats, chicken contained the highest residue levels (quinolones up to 91.97 ppb; streptomycin up to 492.00 ppb), followed by beef (sulfadimethoxine 18.26 ppb; dapsone up to 285.14 ppb). Statistically significant differences were observed among meat types for quinolones (p = 0.000), ceftiofur (p = 0.000), thiamphenicol (p = 0.003), tylosin (p = 0.000), and tetracyclines (p = 0.005). Streptomycin levels varied widely but were not statistically significant (p = 0.072). The findings highlight uncontrolled antibiotic use in Kazakhstan's livestock sector, particularly in poultry farming. The presence of elevated antibiotic residues in meat and feed underscores urgent food safety concerns and the potential acceleration of AMR. Strengthened regulatory oversight, strict adherence to drug withdrawal periods, and adoption of sustainable alternatives such as probiotics and phytogenic feed additives are crucial. Establishing a national monitoring program and expanding laboratory surveillance capacity are essential steps to safeguard public health and promote safe, sustainable livestock production.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41113203/,10.14202/vetworld.2025.2839-2849

Point-of-care testing (POCT) for C-reactive protein (CRP) may help differentiate bacterial from viral infections and support more rational antibiotic use. Objective To assess the effectiveness of POCT CRP testing in reducing antibiotic prescription rates among febrile children in an outpatient pediatric setting. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Maharashtra, India, involving 208 children aged one month to 18 years with febrile illness (≤5 days). Participants were randomized into two groups: Group 1 (n=106) received POCT CRP testing, and Group 2 (n=102) received standard clinical care. CRP was measured using the LumiraDx fluorescence immunoassay (LumiraDx UK Ltd, Alloa, UK). The primary outcome was the rate of antibiotic prescription. Results Antibiotic prescription was significantly higher in Group 1 (59.4%) than in Group 2 (46.1%) (p=0.023). Within the POCT group, 84.2% of children with CRP >20 mg/L were prescribed antibiotics compared to 45.6% with CRP ≤20 mg/L (p=0.0001). Elevated CRP levels were significantly associated with antibiotic prescription, especially in cases of fever and abdominal pain. Conclusion POCT CRP influenced physicians' prescribing decisions, particularly when CRP levels exceeded 20 mg/L. However, without structured integration into clinical algorithms, its use alone did not reduce overall antibiotic use. Physician training and adherence to CRP-based guidance are essential to optimize the benefits of POCT CRP in antimicrobial stewardship.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41111836/,10.7759/cureus.92646
41111801,Adherence to NICE Guidelines and Centor Criteria in Acute Sore Throat Management: An Audit Cycle.,Lynch C,2025,Cureus,"Introduction Antibiotic stewardship is becoming critically important as resistant bacteria become increasingly prevalent. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as a major global health challenge, driven in part by the misuse and overuse of antibiotics. An acute sore throat is one of the most frequent reasons for patients to seek medical care, yet only a minority of cases require antibiotic treatment. Despite this, inappropriate prescribing is rife, often influenced by diagnostic uncertainty, patient expectations, and non-clinical pressures. These challenges highlight the importance of reinforcing evidence-based strategies, such as the use of Centor criteria, to support accurate assessment and reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing in patients presenting with a sore throat. This quality improvement project evaluated adherence to Centor criteria and subsequent antibiotic prescribing in an accident and emergency (A&E) department in the Northwest of England, before and after clinician education on NICE guidance and documentation of Centor criteria. Materials and methods One hundred patients presenting with an acute sore throat between January and March 2023 were identified. Electronic patient data were collected retrospectively to analyze the documentation's adherence to NICE guidelines and Modified Centor criteria. Results Pre-intervention, 16% of clinicians documented all Centor criteria, 48% incorrectly prescribed antibiotics, and only 20% prescribed appropriate antibiotics. Through post-intervention teaching and literature dissemination, the figures changed to 54%, 22%, and 56%, respectively. Conclusion Targeted clinician education and adherence to NICE guidelines improved antibiotic prescribing for the acute sore throat, underscoring the value of audit cycles while highlighting the need for sustained, larger-scale efforts to reduce AMR.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41111801/,10.7759/cureus.92540
41111768,"A Pioneering Study Assessing Knowledge and Awareness of Sickle Cell Disease and Its Association with Oral Health Among Pediatric and General Dentists in Madhya Pradesh, India.","Parihar V, Pradhan D, Paul N, Tiwari S, Thakur R, Parihar S, Gupta V, Sinha K, Menon AG, Vishwakarma A",2025,Cureus,"Introduction The region of Central India, particularly Madhya Pradesh, is characterized by a high incidence of sickle cell disease (SCD) affecting diverse demographic groups. Given the intricate relationship between SCD and oral health, this research aims to assess the understanding and awareness of dentists in Madhya Pradesh, focusing on both pediatric and general dental practitioners. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted using a structured, self-administered questionnaire (Google Forms, Google Inc., Mountain View, CA) comprising 22 closed-ended questions. The questionnaire was disseminated to 200 dental professionals, including 100 pediatric dentists and 100 general dentists practicing in Madhya Pradesh, via WhatsApp groups (Meta Platforms Inc., Menlo Park, CA) of dental associations and personal networks. The gathered data underwent analysis via IBM SPSS Statistics software, version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY), revealing statistical patterns and correlations. Results A significant knowledge gap was observed between pediatric dentists and general dentists in Madhya Pradesh regarding the oral health consequences associated with SCD. While 84% of pediatric dentists recognized the association between SCD and oral health, only 30% of general dentists demonstrated correct knowledge. General dentists showed limited understanding in areas such as SCD testing timing (36%), bone marrow transplant as a cure (29%), common oral manifestations (41%), pulp necrosis in healthy teeth (24%), and local anesthesia safety (33%). However, both groups exhibited good knowledge of aspirin contraindications and prophylactic antibiotic use. Conclusion While pediatric dentists showed satisfactory knowledge, general practitioners require supplementary education to improve their awareness and management of SCD. Future studies should expand to multiple states, use objective measures, and include larger, random samples to enhance generalizability. Clinical significance This pioneering study in Madhya Pradesh and India highlights the need for enhanced education on SCD among dental practitioners. It emphasizes training on SCD diagnosis, oral features, and patient management to improve dental care for SCD patients in the region.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41111768/,10.7759/cureus.92486

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a combination of ampicillin or benzylpenicillin with gentamicin for severe pneumonia in children aged 2-59 months. Real-world adherence to these guidelines remains limited. We conducted a retrospective observational study at St. Luke Hospital in Woliso, Ethiopia, including all children aged 2-59 months admitted with severe pneumonia between May 2021 and April 2024. Antibiotic prescriptions were evaluated for adherence to WHO guidelines and categorized using the WHO AWaRe classification. Clinical outcomes were analyzed based on adherence status using univariate and multivariate analyses. Among 427 patients, 46.1% received guideline-adherent treatment, based on drug selection alone. Gentamicin and ampicillin were underdosed in 94.5% and 62.4% of cases, respectively. Overall, 43.6% of children received at least one antibiotic from the Watch group. In adjusted analyses, adherence to WHO guidelines was associated with longer duration of oxygen therapy (0.7 days, 95% CI: 0.1-1.3, p = 0.02) but showed no significant association with mortality or treatment failure. Adherence to WHO guidelines was suboptimal, particularly regarding antibiotic dosing.

This qualitative study examined communication between infection control workers and pharmacists at MOH hospitals through semi-structured interviews ( This study identified four key themes from 9 participants (6 male, 3 female) regarding antimicrobial stewardship communication challenges: (1) Patient Safety & Communication - emphasizing protocol adherence, interdisciplinary rounds, and preference for formal channels over WhatsApp; (2) Interdisciplinary Collaboration - where leadership engagement and face-to-face committees enhanced decision-making; (3) Healthcare Delivery Challenges - particularly staffing shortages, excessive workloads, and unclear medication protocols; and (4) Training & Development - revealing gaps in feedback systems, limited educational resources, and reactive crisis communication. Critical findings included the need for structured antibiotic monitoring, COO-level support for stewardship programs, resolution of role ambiguities, and implementation of proactive training initiatives to optimize infection control practices. Structured communication—through regular meetings, stewardship rounds, and clear antibiotic guidelines—significantly enhanced infection control outcomes by fostering collaboration between pharmacists and infection control teams. This approach improved adherence to protocols, optimized antibiotic use, and strengthened emergency preparedness, directly contributing to patient safety.

Despite efforts to improve antimicrobial stewardship, behavioral determinants influencing antimicrobial dispensing remain understudied, particularly in low-resource settings like Ethiopia. This study was aimed to explore the behavioral drivers of antimicrobial dispensing among pharmacy professionals working at community drug retail outlets of Addis Ababa. This convergent, parallel mixed-methods study was conducted in three randomly selected sub-cities of Addis Ababa from March to May 2025. The quantitative component addressed the prevalence and predictors of dispensing behavior, surveying 240 pharmacy professionals selected via multi-stage sampling from 120 drug retail outlets. Data were collected using digital (Google Forms) and paper-based questionnaires, measuring TDF-based behavioral determinants and dispensing behavior. Participants were pharmacists and druggists with at least three months of dispensing experience, selected from private pharmacies and drug stores. Hierarchical multiple regression and confirmatory factor analysis were performed using SPSS and AMOS. The qualitative component explored contextual nuances through in-depth interviews with 16 professionals until thematic saturation, analyzed using Dedoose software with a thematic approach, without a predefined framework to allow free expression of feelings. Data quality was ensured through pre-testing, digital validation, and transcription cross-checking. Quantitative findings revealed inappropriate dispensing in 53.75% of cases (129/240). One-sample t-tests showed significant positive deviations for most TDF domains (p < .001), except environmental context (p = .642). Hierarchical regression indicated demographic and behavioral factors explained 62% of dispensing behavior variance, with age (β = 0.630, p < .001), female gender (β = 0.343, p < .001), and behavioral factors; (Professional Role and Self-Regulation: β = 0.456, p < .001; Emotional and Social Dynamics: (β = 0.359, p < .001)) as positive predictors, while Skills and Belief Systems (β=-0.431, p < .001) and experience (≥ 5 years) negatively predicted appropriate dispensing (β=-0.304, p < .001). Qualitative insights highlighted systemic barriers, including patient pressure, profit motives, and weak regulatory enforcement, which often overrode professional knowledge. Triangulation revealed that while pharmacists understood guidelines, workplace pressures and financial incentives drove non-compliance. Inappropriate antimicrobial dispensing was prevalent and significantly influenced by key determinants: longer experience negatively predicted appropriate dispensing, while female gender positively predicted it. Behavioral factors, particularly social and commercial pressures like patient demand and competition, were stronger drivers than knowledge alone.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41107407/,10.1038/s41598-025-20558-w 10.2147/IDR.S428837 10.2147/IDR.S290835 10.2147/IDR.S349358

National guidelines for managing acute diverticulitis recommend that antibiotics should only be given to patients who are systemically unwell, have a background of immunosuppression or have complicated diverticulitis. We analysed the compliance with these guidelines at our hospital, identified gaps, and introduced appropriate measures to improve service provision. This was a closed-loop audit. The first cycle was a retrospective analysis conducted between July and December 2024. Following the identification of gaps in practice, appropriate educational interventions were undertaken, and a second audit cycle was conducted to evaluate their impact. The second cycle was prospectively undertaken between February and May 2025. Adult patients with a computed tomography-confirmed diagnosis of acute diverticulitis met the inclusion criteria. Measured outcomes included demographics, signs and symptoms at presentation, relevant imaging, observations and antibiotic prescription. Standards were derived from National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines with target compliance set at 100%. Forty-three patients were evaluated during the first audit cycle. 24/43 (56%) patients had uncomplicated diverticulitis. Of these, 3/24 were immunocompromised and were appropriately prescribed antibiotics; all the remaining 21/24 patients with a competent immune system and systemically well were given antibiotics against the recommendations, resulting in non-compliance with standards. 19/43 (44%) had complicated diverticulitis, with all receiving antibiotics as recommended, therefore resulting in 100% compliance. Following appropriate interventions, the subsequent audit cycle was conducted, where 35 patients were included in the second cycle. 26/35 had uncomplicated diverticulitis; of these, 8 (31%) required antibiotics due to systemic illness or immunosuppression, 12 (46%) were not prescribed antibiotics in line with the standard, while 6 (23%) unnecessarily received antibiotics against the standard. Compliance therefore improved from 0% to 66% between audit cycles with regards to managing uncomplicated diverticulitis. All nine of the remaining 35 patients with complicated diverticulitis received appropriate antibiotics, achieving 100% compliance, consistent with the previous audit cycle. This quality improvement project highlights the importance of differentiating amongst complicated and uncomplicated diverticulitis, which therefore dictates management, and potentially avoids unnecessary administration of intravenous antibiotics and hospital stay. This article aims to increase awareness among relevant surgical teams in order to improve patient outcomes and reduce pressures on the health care system.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41103853/,10.7759/cureus.92378

Genetic factors are increasingly recognized as contributors to individual susceptibility, yet the specific variants influencing T2DM-associated CHD remain incompletely defined. Complement 5a receptor 2 (C5L2) serves as a receptor for acylation-stimulating protein (ASP) and C5a, regulating glucose uptake, triglyceride clearance, lipid metabolism, and immune signaling, and has been implicated in both pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways. This study investigates whether C5L2 polymorphisms are associated with T2DM-CHD and integrate with metabolic and inflammatory markers in the Han Chinese population from Xinjiang. A hospital-based case-control study was conducted involving 951 adult participants (206 with T2DM and CHD, and 745 controls), who were genotyped for two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), C5L2 rs2972607 and rs8112962, using improved multiplex ligation detection reaction methods. Clinical, hematologic, and biochemical traits were measured. Logistic regression assessed genotype-disease and genotype-phenotype links (sex-adjusted). MDR evaluated high-order gene-environment interactions using 10-fold cross-validation and balanced accuracy. rs2972607 was significantly associated with HDL-C, lymphocytes, platelet indices, AST/ALT, UCB, and 5'-NT; rs8112962 was associated with monocytes and HDL-C. Sex-stratified analyses confirmed associations between HDL-C and UCB in both sexes; platelet effects were stronger in females. In multivariable models, rs2972607 remained a modest but significant independent predictor (OR = 2.07;  C5L2 polymorphisms, particularly rs2972607, are modest but consistent contributors to T2DM-associated CHD and integrate with lipid, platelet, and inflammatory markers, highlighting a potential role in immune-metabolic interplay.

However, the combined use of IPC and ABS measures and ways to optimize their integrated implementation have been insufficiently considered and assessed. The REVERSE trial, funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 program, involves 24 acute care hospitals from four European countries, all with high rates of AMR and HAI. REVERSE aims to investigate whether the sequential implementation of an IPC and an ABS practice bundle is feasible and sustainable and whether externally guided tailoring as an enhanced implementation strategy leads to superior clinical and implementation outcomes compared to a basic implementation condition. REVERSE will be designed as a stepped wedge cluster randomized, hybrid type 2 trial, including an embedded implementation trial. Four cohorts of six acute care hospitals will sequentially enter the trial over 38 months and work to implement first IPC, and, after 1 year, add the ABS practice bundle. Simultaneously, hospitals will be provided basic implementation training and instructed to tailor their implementation, with half of the hospitals being self-guided in their tailoring, whereas hospitals in the enhanced implementation condition will receive time-limited external facilitation in practicing tailoring. Qualitative data will be collected longitudinally to investigate contextual conditions for implementing IPC and ABS locally and how they contribute to tailoring results. IPC and ABS feasibility, fidelity, and sustainability will be assessed together with tailoring fidelity using repeated measures. Retrospective, in-depth, explanatory case studies will be conducted to interpret hospital outcomes. REVERSE is an extensive and complex effectiveness-implementation trial aimed at investigating tailoring effectiveness. It will contribute to the still scarce evidence base for this adaptive approach to integrating research-supported interventions into routine healthcare settings. By identifying pathways toward strengthening the integration of IPC and ABS practices at European acute care hospitals, REVERSE also has the potential to inform much-needed concerted efforts to combat the growing challenge of antimicrobial resistance in the region. In November 2021, the REVERSE study was registered with the ""International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number"" (ISRCTN) register under nr.12956554.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41102820/,10.1186/s13063-025-09132-x

This scoping review aims to synthesise evidence on the opportunities and challenges of leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to tackle AMR within the One Health framework. This review adhered to the PRISMA-ScR guideline. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, along with citation searching and Google Scholar. A total of 543 studies were identified from these databases. After removing duplicates, 343 studies remained for screening. Following the title and abstract screening, 273 publications were selected for full-text review, and 43 studies were included in the final analysis. Studies written in English that explored the application of AI tools and techniques for AMR in any One Health domain were included. The review found that AI is widely applied to combat AMR across different sectors (human, animal, and environmental health), with key opportunities including the rapid identification of resistant pathogens, AI-powered surveillance and early warning, integration of diverse datasets, and support for drug discovery and antibiotic stewardship. However, significant challenges remain, such as data standardisation issues, limited model transparency, infrastructure and resource gaps, ethical and privacy concerns, and difficulties in real-world implementation and validation. Overall, while AI has great potential to improve AMR management, fully realising its benefits will require investment in explainable AI, better data infrastructure, stronger cross-sector collaboration, and clear regulatory frameworks to ensure ethical and effective use within the One Health approach.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41102753/,10.1186/s42522-025-00170-8

We conducted a prospective observational study to test a novel chemiluminescence assay that helps differentiating bacterial and viral infections by combining three host-response proteins (C-reactive protein, TRAIL and IP-10). We enrolled 255 children (age 1-243 months) presenting to a Pediatric Infectious Diseases Unit with fever (60%), cough (22.4%), gastrointestinal symptoms (22%), proven infection (38%). The 22.7% of patients carried at least one comorbidity. The baseline test demonstrated 51% sensitivity and 91% specificity. The diagnostic accuracy was better than traditional biomarkers (C-reactive protein, white blood cell count). Stratifying the analysis by pre-admission antibiotic treatment, naïve patients showed higher sensitivity for bacterial infection (0.70 vs. 0.15), better negative predictive value (0.60 vs. 0.45) and lower error rate (0.24 vs. 0.51). A significant score reduction was observed shortly after starting antibiotic therapy in a subgroup with microbiologically confirmed bacterial diagnosis (mean - 45.12, mean interval = 4 days). We concluded the test could improve infection management in pediatric settings, support initial therapy decision and potentially reduce unnecessary antibiotics.

We estimated incidence rates of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis diagnoses and related antibiotic prescribing among US males and transgender individuals using Merative MarketScan® Research Databases during 2017-2019. Follow-up encompassed 38,543 person-years among recipients of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), 29,228 person-years among people living with HIV (PLWH), and 19,918 person-years among people with prior-year STI diagnoses. Incidence rates of STI diagnoses among PLWH and PrEP recipients with ≥1 prior-year STI diagnosis totaled 33.3-35.5 per 100 person-years. Direct effects of doxyPEP could prevent 7.4-9.6 gonorrhea diagnoses, 7.3-8.1 chlamydia diagnoses, and 3.1-5.9 syphilis diagnoses per 100 person-years of use. However, expected increases in tetracycline consumption resulting from doxyPEP implementation totaled 271.9-312.9 additional 7-day doxycycline treatment courses per 100 person-years of use. These increases corresponded to 37.0-38.7, 36.5-37.0, and 46.1-100.2 additional 7-day doxycycline treatment courses for each prevented gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis diagnosis, respectively. Increases in doxycycline use exceeded anticipated reductions in STI-related prescribing of cephalosporins, macrolides, and penicillins by 16-69-fold margins.

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of a more explicit abbreviation (SFP or 'Susceptible increased exposure') than 'I' on the use of overly broad-spectrum antibiotics for the treatment of infections caused by wild-type (WT) Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A retrospective observational multicenter study was conducted across five hospitals. Two study periods were defined, before and after the implementation of the new abbreviation (from September 2020 to February 2022, and from March 2022 to August 2023). All patients with an infection caused by WT P.aeruginosa treated with β-lactams were included.

41100370,Prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of ESKAPE pathogens in skin and soft tissue infections.,"Singh KN, Agarwal K, Singh P, Rukadikar AR, Hada V, Mohanty A, Rana S, Rahul A, Mishra S",2025,"Indian journal of dermatology, venereology and leprology","Background Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) encompass a wide range of conditions, from superficial infections to life-threatening necrotising fasciitis. Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp. (ESKAPE pathogens) are leading causes of SSTIs and are notable for their antimicrobial resistance. Aim This study aims to determine the prevalence of SSTIs and analyze the resistance patterns of ESKAPE pathogens,providing critical insights for effective treatment strategies. Methods A prospective, observational, cross-sectional study was conducted from January to December 2024 in the Bacteriology section of the Department of Microbiology. A total of 2,300 clinical specimens, including pus, pus swabs, and tissue samples, were processed using standard microbiological techniques. Isolates were identified, and antibiotic susceptibility was assessed following the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Results Among 2,300 samples, 1,311 (57%) were culture-positive, with ESKAPE pathogens detected in 808 (61.6%) culture-positive isolates. Staphylococcus aureus (59.5%) was the most frequently isolated organism, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.8%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was found in 52.2% of isolates. Among Gram-negative bacteria, 15.3% were multidrug-resistant (MDR), but all remained susceptible to colistin. Limitations Conducted at a single center without long-term follow-up, the study may not capture regional differences in resistance, patient demographics, or healthcare practices, nor assess sustained intervention outcomes or relapses. Conclusion ESKAPE pathogens contribute significantly to SSTIs, posing a challenge due to their resistance mechanisms. The high prevalence of MRSA and MDR Gram-negative bacteria highlights the need for continuous surveillance, rational antibiotic use, and alternative treatment strategies to combat antimicrobial resistance effectively.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41100370/,10.25259/IJDVL_417_2025

41094731,Decreased Lumbar Puncture Utilization Following Implementation of Febrile Infant Guidelines in a Pediatric ED.,"Guernsey D, Horner C, Patel P",2025,Pediatric emergency care,"Fever in infants under 60 days old raises concern for invasive bacterial infections. In 2021, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released updated guidelines, including revised recommendations for infants aged 22 to 28 days, to reduce unnecessary lumbar punctures (LP), hospitalizations, and antibiotic use. This study hypothesized that the guidelines would reduce LPs, specifically in the newly stratified age group. We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a single pediatric emergency department of febrile infants aged 22 to 60 days presenting between October 1, 2019, and September 30, 2023, with October 1, 2021, being the division between groups. Infants were excluded if ill-appearing, <37 weeks of gestation, or had complex medical histories. The primary outcome was the proportion undergoing LP. Subgroup analysis was performed by age group, and those identified as low-risk by initial laboratory evaluation. Secondary outcomes included hospital admission, length of stay, and antibiotic use. A total of 132 infants met the inclusion criteria (52 pre-guidelines, 80 post-guidelines), and no exclusion criteria were applied. Following guidelines, the proportion of LPs had a statistically significant decrease (P=0.02), with the reduction maintained in the 22- to 28-day subgroup (P=0.002). The rate of hospital admission and antibiotics followed a similar statistically significant decrease post-guideline introduction, which also maintained for the 22- to 28-day subgroup. There was no statistically significant difference for length of stay or in the 29- to 60-day subgroup analyses. For infants identified as low-risk by laboratory risk-stratification, we discovered a statistically significant reduction in LP following the guidelines (P <0.001). Implementation of the 2021 AAP guidelines was associated with reduced LPs, hospitalizations, and antibiotic use in infants aged 22 to 60 days, with the greatest impact in the 22- to 28-day subgroup. These guidelines improve risk stratification and reduce invasive interventions while maintaining safe care. While the small sample size limits generalizability, these findings suggest a positive shift in clinical practice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41094731/,10.1097/PEC.0000000000003499
41094492,Comparison between vacuum sealing drainage (VSD) and conventional dressing for fournier's gangrene: a single-centre retrospective study.,"Li X, Zhang Y, Xiong F, Li J, Qi S, Wang Q, Mu S, Cao D, Niu S, Liu W, Liu L, Zhang Z",2025,BMC surgery,"Fournier's gangrene (FG) is a life-threatening infection associated with high mortality and often necessitates urgent surgical intervention. Vacuum sealing drainage (VSD) has emerged as a promising adjunct to surgical debridement; however, its impact on antibiotic stewardship remains inadequately studied. This study compares the efficacy of VSD and conventional dressings in the management of FG. In this single-center retrospective study, 104 patients with Fournier's gangrene (FG) treated between January 2022 and December 2023 were analyzed. Patients were categorized into VSD (n = 42) and conventional dressing (n = 62) groups following surgical debridement. Data included demographics, comorbidities, infection sites, Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) scores, antibiotic duration, and clinical outcomes. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was applied to mitigate confounding biases. Before IPTW adjustment, the VSD group exhibited longer durations in key clinical outcomes compared to the control group, including time to leukocyte normalization (+ 1.6 days), antibiotic use (+ 2.0 days), and hospital stay (+ 2.0 days). After IPTW adjustment, all three indicators showed improvement in favor of the VSD group. Generalized weighted regression further confirmed that VSD was associated with significant clinical benefits: shortened time to leukocyte normalization (mean difference: -1.8 days; 90% CI: -3.5 to -0.1), reduced duration of antibiotic therapy (-2.0 days; 90% CI: -3.7 to -0.4), and decreased length of hospitalization (-3.0 days; 90% CI:-5.7 to -0.4).Post-IPTW, VSD emerged as a protective factor, with all standardized mean differences (SMDs) remaining below 0.2, indicating acceptable covariate balance. VSD may improve clinical outcomes in patients with Fournier's gangrene by accelerating recovery and reducing antibiotic use and length of hospitalization. These benefits appear more pronounced in patients with high LRINEC scores or extensive infections. Nevertheless, individualized treatment strategies should consider systemic disease severity, such as the Fournier's Gangrene Severity Index (FGSI).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41094492/,10.1186/s12893-025-03242-8

This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable machine learning (ML) model for forecasting prolonged hospital stays of the AECOPD population. A retrospective analysis was performed utilizing data from the MIMIC-IV database on patients diagnosed with AECOPD. The dataset was split into a training set (80%) and a validation set (20%). Feature selection was executed through LASSO regression and the Boruta algorithm. Logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), neural network (NN), gradient boosting machine (GBM), naive Bayes (NB), as well as K-nearest neighbors (KNN) models were constructed based on the selected features. Model performance was evaluated via receiver operating characteristic (ROC), calibration and decision curves. The interpretability of the optimal model was enhanced through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. 7,373 AECOPD patients were encompassed. The final model incorporated the following features: hemoglobin, platelet count, anion gap, blood urea nitrogen(BUN), potassium, chloride, antibiotic use, invasive ventilation, vasopressor use, SOFA, body temperature(Tb), heart rate(HR), acute kidney injury (AKI), as well as sepsis. The RF model demonstrated the best predictive performance, with an area of the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.817 in the training set and 0.715 in the validation set, along with good calibration and clinical utility. SHAP analysis further enhanced the interpretability of the model, providing valuable clinical decision support. The RF model developed in our study exhibited excellent performance in predicting prolonged hospital stays in AECOPD patients. The incorporation of interpretability analysis improved the transparency and reliability of its clinical application. Not applicable.

41089327,Knowledge and practices related to antimicrobial use in fighting cocks - a survey of fighting cock owners in Timor-Leste.,"Pereira AJ, Amaral F, Coppo MJC, Bailey KE, Ting S, Gilkerson J, Browning GF, Jong JBDC, Toribio JLML",2025,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,"Cock fighting is an industry with a long standing in Southeast Asia and the birds have a high value. However, there is scant published literature on antimicrobial use and knowledge about antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among fighting cock owners in Timor-Leste. This survey assessed knowledge of fighting cock owners about antimicrobials and AMR, and their use of antimicrobials in fighting cocks. This was a cross-sectional survey conducted on randomly selected owners of fighting cocks in urban areas in Timor-Leste between February and March 2023. Data collection was done using a structured questionnaire administered by face-to-face interviews. A total of 275 participants were interviewed. Knowledge about antimicrobials and AMR among fighting cock owners in Timor-Leste was poor. Owners in urban areas (aOR = 2.4, 95% CI [1.4-4.1], p-value = 0.002) and those with higher education (aOR = 2.3, 95% CI [1.3-4.2], p-value = 0.007) were more knowledgeable about antimicrobials. The majority used antimicrobials (76.2%, 205/269) in their cocks and the most common antimicrobials used were amoxicillin (77.5%, 159/205) and ampicillin (54.2%, 111/205).

41088991,RGD Peptide-Based Hydrogel Enhances the Osteogenic Differentiation of Periodontal Ligament Stem Cells via Wnt Signaling.,"Naeem N, Siddiqui MA, Ahmed N, Ansari AS, Haneef K",2025,Current protein & peptide science,"Periodontitis results in progressive loss of gingival tissue and periodontal ligament, eventually resulting in tooth instability. As regenerating degraded periodontal tissue is not possible without intervention, therefore, a tissue-engineered substitute is a good option. Bone regeneration strategies often rely on either biochemical stimulation or engineered scaffolds, but rarely in a coordinated manner. Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid (RGD) hydrogel provides a unique combination of biocompatibility and biodegradability, making it an attractive scaffold for tissue engineering. The study aims to investigate the effect of combining Wnt pathway activation with Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid (RGD) hydrogel (a three-dimensional environment, 3D) to enhance the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from periodontal ligament tissue. The cells were isolated from the root of the extracted tooth. They were grown in an osteogenic medium with and without a Wnt activator in two-dimensional (2D) and RGD hydrogel- based 3D environments to expand in vitro. Osteogenic gene expression was evaluated by qPCR in 2D and 3D cultures. Mesenchymal stem cells isolated from periodontal ligament tissue showed osteogenic differentiation when cultured in a differential medium with or without the Wnt signaling activator, CHIR99021 (a GSK3β inhibitor). The data of our study revealed that osteogenic genes were expressed in both 2D- and 3D-- cultured cells. However, higher expression of osteogenic genes was found in Wnt signaling-activated cells. Furthermore, the RGD hydrogel provided better differentiation efficacy and a significant increase (p < 0.001) in terms of Wnt-activated differentiation. The RGD hydrogel-Wnt activation model described in this study holds strong potential for translation into preclinical bone regeneration strategies. By enhancing osteogenic differentiation through a synergistic interaction between the Wnt signaling pathway and the 3D peptide hydrogel matrix, this platform offers a promising approach to early-stage testing of bone regeneration therapies. Hence, the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) hydrogel-based 3D microenvironment along with a Wnt signaling activator provides superior efficacy in differentiation since it allows cell encapsulation and an environment that closely simulates native tissues. Therefore, these findings highlight the synergistic effect of biochemical and biophysical cues in directing stem cell fate and offer a promising strategy for advancing stem cell-based bone tissue engineering.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41088991/,10.2174/0113892037389217250916074726

EMR specific barriers of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) remain under documented. A mixed methods study was conducted to explore barriers and opportunities for ASP implementation in EMR focusing on low (LIC) and lower middle-income countries (LMIC) with relatively stable policy environments and demonstrated interest, capacity, and infrastructure for stewardship. We used literature review, semi-structured interviews of experts, and a stakeholder consultation. Seven key themes emerged: One, AMS implementation capacity varies across the region, necessitating tailored approaches. Two, the limited availability of expertise requires urgent upscaling of knowledge and capacity. Three, mentorship and the development of centres of excellence is needed. Four, existing AMS tools should be enhanced, disseminated, and occasionally, adjusted to local needs. Five, the lack of a sustainable platform for networking impedes collaboration. Six, accreditation and national level mandates for hospital AMS can support scale-up. Seven, expanding research is critical to inform local evidence-based action. Several components of ASPs are achievable in the EMR using existing resources with targeted support from local and identified regional and global partners.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41088298/,10.1186/s13756-025-01625-3

However, research on the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) in Chinese ICUs is limited. This study aimed to assess the impact of ASP implementation on antibiotic use and bacterial resistance in a Chinese ICU.  This retrospective, interventional study employed an interrupted time series design and was conducted in an ICU beginning on June 1, 2019. The ASP included the formation of a multidisciplinary team, the development of facility-specific criteria, prescriber education, the implementation of preauthorization processes, and retrospective prescription audit and feedback (RPAF). Patient data were collected from June 1, 2018, to May 31, 2020. An interrupted time series analysis was used to evaluate the impact of the ASP. A total of 862 patients were admitted during the pre-intervention period, and 946 patients were admitted during the post-intervention period. The interrupted time series analysis demonstrated a reduction in the monthly consumption of carbapenems (β3: -2.25 DDD/100 PD, p < 0.001) and linezolid (β3: -0.49 DDD/100 PD, p = 0.003) after the intervention. Additionally, a decrease in the incidence of bacteremia caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms overall (β3:-0.03 events/100 PD, p = 0.036) and MDR Gram-positive organisms (β3:-0.01 events/100 PD, p = 0.002) was observed post-intervention. Reduced antimicrobial consumption and decreased incidence of infections associated with MDR organisms were observed following the implementation of an ASP strategy that incorporated clinical pharmacists as core team members.

Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) have been shown to reduce resistance, adverse effects, and healthcare costs. MALDI-TOF MS enables fast and accurate microbial identification. This study evaluates the impact of its implementation on antibiotic therapy adequacy and mortality in Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. A quasi-experimental pre-post study was conducted at a university hospital, covering two periods: June 2015/April 2017 (pre) and June 2021/April 2023 (post). The impact of MALDI-TOF on antibiotic adequacy and mortality was analyzed. A total of 176 episodes were included (85 pre, 91 post). No significant epidemiological differences were observed between groups, although higher rates of sepsis and septic shock were noted in the post phase. MALDI-TOF was associated with improved antibiotic adjustment (3.51 vs. 1.75 days; P < .001). A non-significant trend toward lower early mortality was observed in the post-intervention group (P = .06). Mortality was associated with higher comorbidity (Charlson index), sepsis/septic shock, and MRSA bacteremia. The implementation of MALDI-TOF, in conjunction with a multidisciplinary ASP, enhances early adjustment of empirical antibiotic therapy and may be associated with reduced early mortality in S. aureus bacteremia.

This study aimed to develop and externally validate a machine learning model for predicting MDR UTIs in patients with brain and spinal cord injuries. We retrospectively analyzed 849 patients with brain or spinal cord injuries and culture-confirmed UTIs. Data from a single institution were used for model training, and the other served as an external test set. Five machine learning models and ensemble models were trained and evaluated. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The finally selected ensemble model, combining Naive Bayes and Random Forest, achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.8425, with an accuracy of 0.7688, sensitivity of 0.7647, specificity of 0.7697, positive predictive value of 0.4262, and negative predictive value of 0.9360. Important predictors included recent antibiotic use, total Functional Independence Measure score, neutrophil-to-platelet ratio, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, age, hematocrit, hemoglobin, serum protein, serum albumin, and urethral indwelling catheter. Externally validated, the model showed consistent performance across institutions. It may support early MDR risk stratification in patients with brain and spinal cord injuries.

This study aimed to evaluate the association of ASP suspension with hospital-wide antibiotic consumption. This retrospective single-center study analyzed monthly antibiotic use as days of therapy per 1,000 patient-days from January 2021 to November 2024. Interrupted time-series analysis using segmented regression was applied to evaluate changes before and after suspension. After ASP suspension, restricted antibiotic use significantly increased in both level (coefficient: 15.998; 95% CI, 3.492-28.504; P = .013) and trend (coefficient: 2.475; 95% CI, 0.326-4.625; P = .025). Preauthorization antibiotics showed significant increases in both level (coefficient: 12.501; 95% CI, 4.692-20.310; P = .002) and trend (coefficient: 1.497; 95% CI, 0.133-2.862; P = .032). Prospective audit and feedback-targeted antibiotics exhibited no level change but a significant postsuspension trend increase (coefficient: 1.337; 95% CI, 0.531-2.143; P = .002). Nonrestricted antibiotics did not show significant changes. The suspension of ASP was associated with a marked increase in restricted antibiotic use, particularly those subject to preauthorization.

We investigated the clinical impact of implementing direct disk diffusion testing (dDDT) for Gram-negative bacteremia. This retrospective cohort study compared patients with Gram-negative bacteremia before (n=212) and after (n=214) dDDT implementation. The primary outcome, 30-day mortality, was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, with logistic regression for sensitivity analysis. Secondary analyses on therapy appropriateness and the antibiotic spectrum index (ASI) were performed using a mixed-design ANOVA. dDDT reduced the mean time to susceptibility results by ∼24 hours (37.6±14.3 hours vs. 61.6±16.3 hours hours). Post-implementation, the appropriateness of therapy for multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) significantly improved from 76.5% to 91.2% (p=0.048). ASI analysis confirmed these changes were driven by appropriate escalation for MDROs and de-escalation for non-MDROs. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed lower cumulative mortality post-dDDT (p=0.023), but dDDT was not an independent predictor of 30-day mortality in multivariate analysis (aHR 1.27, 95% CI 0.76-2.14). dDDT implementation significantly shortens time-to-results and improves antibiotic appropriateness, facilitating timely stewardship. While a trend towards lower mortality was observed, dDDT was not an independent predictor of survival, highlighting the multifactorial nature of patient outcomes. Direct disk diffusion testing (dDDT) for Gram-negative bacteremia significantly shortens susceptibility reporting, improves antibiotic appropriateness, and may guide antibiotic stewardship. While a trend towards lower mortality was observed, dDDT was not an independent predictor of survival in this study.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41083046/,10.1016/j.ijid.2025.108127

Sea Cucumber Peptides (SCP) are recognized for their antioxidant properties and neuroprotective potential, while no specific SCP have been documented for PD treatment. Moreover, sea cucumbers have long been consumed as a traditional food; viewed through the lens of ""food-medicine homology"", their peptides possess clear pharmaceutical potential. This study sets out to pinpoint particular peptide sequences from sea cucumbers could combat PD, exploring their therapeutic efficacy and the underlying mechanisms. We treated Rotenone (Rot)-induced C57BL/6 J mice and SH-SY5Y cells with the SCP which were extracted from the sea cucumbers, to assess the impact on behavioral metrics in mice, histopathological outcomes, cellular viability, and in vitro bioactivity. Employing a combination of peptide profiling and silico analysis, we established a SCP spectrum to identify novel SCP with potential anti-PD activity. The therapeutic effects and mechanisms of the peptides were further investigated in 7-day-old zebrafish larvae and SH-SY5Y cells exposed in Rot, respectively. Our findings indicate that the SCP significantly improved behavioral deficits in mice, reduced the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, and increased the survival of Rot-exposed SH-SY5Y cells. Notably, a novel peptide, Gln-Trp-Phe-Asp-Trp (QWFDW), emerged from our peptide profiling and in silico analysis, showing significant anti-PD activity. QWFDW was demonstrated to enhance the behavioral performance of Rot-induced zebrafish larvae, and ameliorate the pathological features of PD by attenuating endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) and maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential in SH-SY5Y cells. At the cellular level, QWFDW activates the Nrf2/HO-1/GPX4 pathway to alleviate ferroptosis and exert therapeutic effects on PD. Collectively, our results point out that SCP, particularly QWFDW, was a prospective therapeutic agent for PD.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41082072/,10.1007/s11481-025-10242-1 10.1017/S1740925X11000093 10.1016/j.jagp.2014.05.008 10.3390/ijms25021302 10.2147/NDT.S2056 10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00218-X 10.1016/j.ntt.2004.06.014 10.3390/md15020042 10.1080/1028415X.2017.1299437 10.1111/bph.14801 10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.09.067 10.1016/j.cell.2012.03.042 10.1007/s13197-021-05245-8 10.1212/01.wnl.0000247740.47667.03 10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01426.x 10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.03.075 10.3390/ijms25074004 10.1016/j.jff.2017.12.022 10.1007/s13197-019-04081-1 10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.08.014 10.1007/s11064-014-1323-1 10.1038/s41586-021-04059-0 10.1016/j.neuint.2017.01.004 10.1111/j.1753-4887.2012.00476.x 10.3389/fphar.2023.1117337 10.1016/0304-3940(85)90580-4 10.1038/ncpneuro0924 10.1016/j.tox.2019.02.011 10.1007/s12035-022-03193-8 10.1016/j.neuro.2014.12.002 10.1016/j.jff.2010.01.003 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2020.10.323 10.1016/j.brainres.2024.148824 10.1007/s12035-025-04824-6 10.1016/j.jff.2019.06.014 10.1021/acs.jafc.1c05155 10.1021/acs.jafc.2c02696 10.1021/acs.jafc.1c06475 10.1016/j.jff.2023.105732 10.1039/D4FO01512F 10.1016/j.ejphar.2024.176430 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2020.101890 10.1016/j.biopha.2018.11.063 10.1039/C3FO60702J 10.3390/ijms20235978 10.1016/j.cofs.2024.101125 10.1007/s00702-020-02149-3 10.1371/journal.pone.0045012 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2012.05.009 10.2169/internalmedicine.8940-21 10.1038/s41573-020-00135-8 10.1002/mds.22061 10.1016/j.arr.2020.101206 10.3390/md17090505 10.1016/j.jtcme.2017.06.007 10.1016/S0166-2236(03)00144-9 10.1002/mds.23732 10.3390/md20100610 10.1016/j.redox.2018.11.017 10.1016/j.foodres.2021.110468 10.1016/j.tins.2014.02.011 10.1016/j.brainresbull.2024.110991 10.1016/j.redox.2021.101971 10.1136/pgmj.2003.013912 10.1136/pgmj.2006.054759 10.1136/jnnp-2019-322042 10.1016/j.tifs.2014.02.004 10.1007/s11064-022-03548-6 10.1038/s41531-023-00561-6 10.1186/1471-2202-11-92 10.1186/1742-2094-9-124 10.1038/srep36669 10.1016/j.bbi.2020.01.003 10.1038/s41419-021-03718-4 10.1016/j.jff.2021.104677 10.1016/j.fct.2023.113652 10.1093/nar/gkab255 10.1016/j.jff.2018.08.009 10.1016/j.jff.2020.103909 10.1016/j.cell.2013.12.010 10.1093/bioinformatics/bty707 10.1007/s12035-020-02128-5 10.1016/j.neuint.2014.06.001 10.3389/fnagi.2020.00201 10.3389/fnmol.2020.563054 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2022.06.241 10.26599/FMH.2024.9420023 10.1039/D1FO00631B 10.1016/j.jff.2015.12.003
41082070,Applying Data Science Practices to Identify Characteristics of Postsecondary Autism Support Programs From Their Websites.,"West M, Tincani M, Hantula D, Hong SR, Vucetic S, Dragut E",2025,Journal of autism and developmental disorders,"An increasing number of autistic students in the United States are seeking post-secondary education. In response, some post-secondary institutions have established Autism Support Programs (ASP) to address the comprehensive needs of this population. There is little up-to-date, comprehensive information about which institutions host these programs, what types of services they offer, and what is required to access them. Expanding on previous research, we introduce a new method, which utilizes established data science techniques, to identify ASPs at post-secondary institutions in the U.S. Our technique also allows us to identify the characteristics of the ASPs, including admissions requirements, cost, structure, and supports offered. Results highlight our method is more efficient and more robust than previous methods from the literature. For example, we identify 49 schools hosting ASPs that were not identified in past literature searches. We report on the characteristics of identified ASPs such as application process, most common supports and program cost. The bi-directional change in the number of ASPs shows that this is an evolving field, requiring automated tools to enable regular updates to data.

An a priori sample size of 30 National Health Service staff and 10 patient interviews was selected to elicit information relating to the aims. Interview schedules were developed, and all interviews were conducted via video or teleconferencing between December 2021 and December 2022 and lasted between 10 and 60 minutes. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 National Health Service clinicians and seven patients and legal representatives. National Health Service staff were risk-averse to stopping empirical antifungal therapy, especially if the patient was improving, while patients were risk-neutral. Although there is a clear unmet need for new rapid testing strategy, clinical confidence in its accuracy, clinical utility, cost-effectiveness and usability were strong factors for its consideration for use in decision-making and adoption. Patients did not exhibit strong feelings towards stopping empirical antifungal treatment as they expressed reliance on clinical judgement. There was a potential for selection bias as interview participants being from participating sites. The target recruitment numbers of patients and their legal representatives was not achieved due to low retention rates. If found to have high accuracy and cost-effectiveness, the potential of the Antifungal STewardship Opportunities diagnostic strategy to aid decision-making on antifungal prescribing could change intensive care unit clinicians practice, as they are risk-averse to stopping empirical antifungal treatment. However, consideration of the resources needed including staff, and lab facilities, adequate training as well as established guidelines to facilitate its adoption is required. Our next aim is to use Antifungal STewardship Opportunities results to inform the update of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines and explore schemes such as the Accelerated Access Collaborative and MedTech funding mandate to propel the adoption of this testing strategy. This article presents independent research funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme as award number 15/116/03. Invasive candidiasis is a serious fungal infection of the blood or other organs which can lead to death, especially in critically ill patients. Diagnosing this infection involves a lengthy process which takes up to 2 days or more. Due to the risks of starting treatment late, doctors often start treatment with antifungal medications before having results available. Faster diagnosis is crucial for efficient antimicrobial stewardship and to reduce unnecessary use of potentially toxic and costly drugs. Antifungal STewardship Opportunities study is investigating the use of rapid tests to improve how we diagnose invasive candidiasis in the United Kingdom. ‘Stewardship’ is about responsible use of medications that fight off infections. It is believed that these tests will help physicians make the decision on whether antifungal drugs are needed in a timelier way. Our objective was to understand the risk preferences of patients and physicians in using the Antifungal STewardship Opportunities testing strategy for stopping or modifying medications prescribed before test results were available. The study involved interviews with 21 National Health Service staff members and seven patients or their legal representatives, conducted between December 2021 and December 2022. The results of the interviews indicated that National Health Service clinicians were generally reluctant to take the risks of stopping the use of antifungal medications if the patient’s health conditions improved. Patients trusted their physicians in their decision to continue or stop the treatment. All agreed that there is the need for a quicker, cost-effective, reliable and easy-to-use test. These factors would increase the likelihood for the test to be adopted. To assess the potential of the test, National Health Service needs to have staff and lab capacity to deliver on faster turnaround times. If the Antifungal STewardship Opportunities diagnostic strategy is proven effective, the development of guidelines to support its implementation in National Health Service will follow.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41081795/,10.3310/GJRM3321

Given the ongoing advancements in scientific evidence, it is imperative to discuss the Infectious Diseases training program. The aim of this study was to characterize and explore the respondents' perceptions regarding Infectious Diseases training and the clinical learning environment. A survey was developed to assess the clinical learning environment, targeting residents and young specialists who completed their training within the past five years. The questionnaire received 73 responses, 75.3% from residents. Most respondents agreed with the duration of Internal Medicine (83.5%), Microbiology (76.7%), and General Infectious Diseases (71.2%) rotations, but considered that the Intensive Care rotation should last less than six months. The areas of Infection Control/Antibiotic Stewardship and Immunosuppression/Infectious Risk were suggested as mandatory rotations by 84.9% and 65.8% of participants, respectively. Most respondents (67.1%) considered prolonged Internal Medicine Emergency rotations beyond the first year detrimental. In contrast, 84.6% of ARS Norte participants only performed this activity during the first year, whereas 86.8% of ARS LVT participants continued, at least, until the fourth year. Regarding clinical and scientific output, ARS Norte interns reported, on average, higher numbers of weekly assisted (21.7 vs 17.1) and performed (20.8 vs 17.7) appointments, as well as higher annual participation (3.7 vs 3.1) and presentations (2.8 vs 2.4) in scientific events, published articles (1.1 vs 0.6), and weekly study hours (7.4 vs 4.5), compared with ARS LVT. The main challenges reported were a lack of dedicated study time during working hours, scientific updates, and clinical practice in Internal Medicine Emergency rotations. Regarding the evaluation of the residency program, only 2.7% agreed completely with the current exam model and 1.37% with the current curriculum grid. The majority (64.4%) of participants considered themselves at least satisfied with the specialty. The results suggest a need to review the Infectious Diseases training program, include new areas of specialization, and discuss evaluation models throughout residency. Regional asymmetries were observed in emergency work, clinical and scientific output, which affect the equity and quality of training. Discussion of the Infectious Diseases training program is crucial for adapting the curriculum to current and future challenges. Introdução: A Organização Mundial de Saúde definiu as 13 mais importantes ameaças à Saúde Global da década, das quais se destacam a prevenção de doenças infeciosas e a resistência antimicrobiana. Dada a evolução célere da evidência científica e a necessidade de atualização, é imperativo discutir a formação em Doenças Infeciosas. Este estudo teve como objetivo caracterizar e explorar a perceção dos inquiridos relativamente à formação em Doenças Infeciosas e ao ambiente clínico de aprendizagem. Métodos: Foi desenvolvido um questionário sobre os ambientes clínicos de aprendizagem, dirigido a médicos internos e recém-especialistas que tenham concluído o seu programa de formação nos últimos cinco anos, inclusive. Resultados: O questionário obteve 73 respostas, 75,3% de médicos internos. A maioria concordou com a duração dos estágios de Medicina Interna (83,5%), Microbiologia (76,7%) e Infeciologia Geral (71,2%), mas considerou que o estágio de Medicina Intensiva deveria ter uma duração inferior a seis meses. Foi sugerido que as áreas de Controlo de Infeção/Prescrição Antibiótica e de Imunossupressão/Risco Infecioso tivessem estágios obrigatórios, por 84,9% e 65,8% dos participantes, respetivamente. A maioria (67,1%) dos inquiridos considerou prejudicial a realização de urgência externa de Medicina Interna para além do respetivo estágio, sendo que 84,6% dos participantes da ARS Norte realizaram esta atividade apenas durante o 1.º ano, em contraste com 86,8% da ARS LVT cuja atividade se prolongou pelo menos até ao 4.º ano. No que concerne à produção assistencial e científica, comparativamente aos médicos internos da ARS LVT, os da ARS Norte reportaram, em média, um maior número de consultas assistidas (21,7/17,1) e realizadas (20,8/17,7), semanalmente, assim como um maior número de participações (3,7/3,1) e apresentações (2,8/2,4) anuais em eventos científicos, artigos publicados (1,1/0,6) e horas de estudo semanais (7,4/4,5). As principais dificuldades reportadas foram a ausência de tempo de estudo dedicado no horário, a atualização científica e a realização de Urgência Externa de Medicina Interna.

41081037,Regulatory gaps in over-the-counter antifungal access for vulvovaginal candidiasis in Uganda: A policy analysis framework.,"Jonani B, Kwizera R",2025,IJID regions,"Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) affects approximately 75% of women globally, with a particularly high prevalence (30-45%) among women of reproductive age in Uganda. Over-the-counter (OTC) antifungal medications are a critical access point for treatment in resource-limited settings; however, their unregulated availability raises important questions regarding appropriate use, diagnostic accuracy, and antimicrobial stewardship. We aimed to analyze Uganda's regulatory framework governing OTC antifungal medications for VVC management, identify key policy gaps, and develop an evidence-based framework to balance accessibility with appropriate use. This study employed a documentary analysis of Ugandan pharmaceutical policy documents (2000-2025) combined with a systematic review of the published literature on medication regulation and self-medication practices. A structured policy analysis framework was applied to examine the classification systems, implementation mechanisms, and provision of oversight for antifungal medications. Uganda's current regulatory framework increases antifungal accessibility through liberal OTC classification but neglects complementary measures to ensure appropriate use and safety. Five critical policy gaps were identified: (i) diagnostic accuracy: no provisions ensure proper differentiation of VVC from other conditions; (ii) treatment completion: no mechanisms ensure adherence to recommended treatment durations; (iii) safety screening: absence of pregnancy screening requirements for contraindicated fluconazole; (iv) personnel training, inadequate VVC-specific training for drug shop operators; and (v) product regulation: insufficient oversight of combination products. These gaps exist within the healthcare context, where 62% of antimicrobials are supplied by private vendors with minimal oversight. We propose an evidence-based framework that balances accessibility with appropriate use. The identified policy gaps potentially compromise women's health outcomes through inappropriate treatment, incomplete therapy courses, preventable medication risks, and conditions that favor the development of antifungal resistance. The policy tensions between accessibility and appropriate use highlight the need for gender-sensitive pharmaceutical regulations that maintain access while implementing targeted safeguards for improved health outcomes and antimicrobial stewardship.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41081037/,10.1016/j.ijregi.2025.100746 10.1093/cid/ciy776 10.1016/S1473-3099(18)30103-8 10.1093/cid/ciab1057 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60917-9 10.9734/BMRJ/2015/13804 10.1093/mmy/myac037 10.1016/j.ijregi.2025.100680 10.1128/CMR.00076-09 10.3390/jof6010027 10.2147/IDR.S118892 10.1016/S0140-6736(24)01695-7 10.1126/science.aap7999 10.1128/AAC.01299-15 10.1186/1472-698X-10-29 10.1186/s40545-014-0018-y 10.1186/s12889-025-21380-9 10.1258/0956462054308387 10.4269/ajtmh.21-1132 10.3390/jof8050508 10.1177/20499361241255261 10.2147/ppa.s4091 10.1111/j.1468-2397.2010.00771.x 10.4269/ajtmh.2009.80.905 10.1186/s12916-015-0346-z 10.1186/s12936-017-2072-9 10.1363/2025.300621 10.1186/s40545-020-00265-9 10.1089/pop.2020.0265 10.1097/AOG.0000000000000551 10.1136/bmj.m1494 10.1007/s40257-020-00580-6 10.1007/s40588-024-00219-8 10.21203/rs.3.rs-3937181/v1 10.1371/journal.pone.0115440

Machine learning model developed using expert-labeled point-prevalence data. Single-center adult academic hospital. Hospitalized patients 18 years or older on internal medicine services between May 2021 and August 2022. Infectious disease experts assessed antibiotic orders for necessity and optimal use to create labels which were used as ground truth to train a machine learning model that uses automatically queried data from the electronic health record including vital signs, laboratory values, microbiological data, and medication administration records.

Vulnerable populations - particularly pregnant women - arriving there require both routine and urgent medical services. We describe a novel approach to triaging pregnant migrant women, observed clinical presentations, and the effects on healthcare resource utilization. The Lampedusa Protocol was implemented in March 2023 by the Agenzia Sanitaria Provinciale (ASP) of Palermo and the Italian National Institute for Health, Migration and Poverty (INMP). Clinical and demographic data from 28 March 2023 to 31 May 2024 were collected and analyzed by cross-referencing the clinical databases of the policlinic of Lampedusa and the Italian Red Cross, the managing entity of the migrant hotspot. Resource utilization data were collected from the helicopter transfer data recorded by the emergency medical service for the island. Associations between patient characteristics and need for helicopter evacuation were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. A total of 571 pregnant patients were assessed and treated between 3/28/2023-5/31/2024. Patients represented 23 nationalities, average age was 26 years (SD=6.6 years), and average ultrasound-estimated gestational age was 25.2 weeks (SD=9.6 weeks). The most common causes for needing helicopter transfer were late gestational age or concern for, or symptoms of, labor.

PADL aligned well with the medicine's reconciliation process, the process of accurately listing a person's current medicines, which meant it better aligned with pharmacists' and MOPTs' roles than doctors' roles. Healthcare worker (HCW) confidence to deliver PADL remained low among some doctors and pharmacists, but all reported that with time and support PADL would embed. Competing priorities in an inadequately resourced healthcare setting made PADL challenging. Professional bodies formally defining PADL as a core role for their HCWs would increase engagement with PADL. The PADL champion role was identified as key to the implementation of PADL. Competing priorities were limiting PADL engagement and as such PADL needs to be a core part of a HCW's role for it to be prioritized.

It is estimated that, in certain situations, up to 80% of antibiotic prescriptions in dentistry may be inappropriate. The aim of this study was to explore Spanish dentists' attitudes, perceptions, and contextual factors influencing antibiotic use and misuse in clinical practice. From July to December 2022, we conducted focus groups with 31 dentists from Spain Data were analysed using thematic analysis with a pragmatic orientation to address the research objectives. Inclusion criteria required participants to be dentistry graduates or oral medicine specialists (stomatologists) and actively working as dentists. The sample was selected through key informants and the snowball method. We ensured methodological quality by adhering to the COREQ checklist. We formed seven synchronous online focus groups with 31 participants. Dentists acknowledged the problem of antibiotic resistance, identifying fear, working conditions and burnout and patient trust as factors contributing to inappropriate prescribing. Despite this awareness, dentists did not see themselves as key agents of change in combating antibiotic resistance. However, they expressed interest in further education on the topic. These findings underscore the need for educational interventions that highlight dentists' role in antimicrobial stewardship. By situating these interventions within the One Health framework, dentists can be empowered to translate their leadership in oral health into active participation in the prudent use of antibiotics.

Its prevalence is increasing worldwide, however optimal management remains unclear. This study aimed to determine current practice and short-term outcomes globally. A prospective, international cohort study of patients presenting with acute diverticulitis to secondary care units was undertaken. Countries were stratified by geographical region and income groups. Patients presenting over a 44-week recruitment period (1/10/2020-31/8/2021) were included. Patient and disease covariates, management and short-term outcomes were captured in a secure web application. The primary outcome of interest was the geographical variation in presentation and treatment.

Accumulating observational evidence links prenatal, perinatal, and early childhood exposures to later IBD risk. Several mechanisms underpin this relationship, including gut microbiome development, immune system maturation, epigenetic modulation, and metabolic and endocrine programming. Building on this framework, this review outlines potential intervention strategies across key developmental stages-from maternal nutrition and microbiome modulation during pregnancy to delivery-related factors such as birth mode, intrapartum antibiotic use, and early breastfeeding practices. Postnatal strategies include breastfeeding promotion, timely and diverse dietary introduction, antibiotic stewardship, and minimization of detrimental environmental exposures. Such approaches may be particularly relevant for high-risk groups, notably children born to individuals with IBD. Practical guidance is provided for families affected by IBD, alongside a discussion on how universal and risk-stratified strategies may be integrated. However, it is important to note that most of these strategies remain hypothetical, with limited validation. Emerging research areas include maternal dietary interventions, microbiome-based therapies, and the utilization of digital tools for risk monitoring. This review also addresses ethical and implementation challenges inherent to early-life prevention research and intervention. Early life represents a critical window for immune/gut development, influencing lifelong risk of inflammatory bowel disease. Preventive approaches addressing maternal factors, microbial exposures, and environmental factors—particularly in high-risk infants—may support early risk stratification, modification and long-term disease prevention.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41078161/,10.1093/ibd/izaf205

The baseline characteristics of the population, bloodstream infection and antimicrobial treatment were compared between survivors and non-survivors as well. Of 527 cases of BSIs, 63.6% (n=335) were caused by Enterobacterales and 307 cases were included. The overall mortality rate was 11.1% (n=34). In the multivariable regression model, septic shock/multiorgan failure (HR 9.69, 95% CI: 3.28-28.63), and empirical treatment failure (HR 3.4, 95% CI: 1.36-8.45) were associated with an increased mortality risk. in this study, the mortality in pediatric BSIs was driven by severe clinical presentation and failure to control inflammatory response and infection.

41076983,Alberta beef industry stakeholders' perspectives towards adoption of preconditioning practices: A thematic analysis.,"Mijar S, Pearson J, Lutevele N, Orsel K",2025,Research in veterinary science,"Preconditioning offers significant benefits for calf health, performance, and a smoother transition to the feedlot environment, while also helping to reduce antimicrobial use in feedlots. Despite these benefits, the adoption of preconditioning by cow-calf producers, as well as the buying and selling of preconditioned calves by feedlot operators and auctioneers, remains relatively low. However, some producers continue to precondition their calves regardless of lack of industry interest. To increase the implementation of preconditioning and improve calves' welfare within the industry, it is crucial to understand the motivators and barriers influencing its adoption among cow-calf operators, feedlot operators, and auctioneers, as well as the associated market dynamics around preconditioned calves. Therefore, semi-structured interviews were conducted with twelve cow-calf operators, three feedlot operators, and five auctioneers in Alberta, and the data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Motivations and barriers were classified as either generic or specific to participant groups. Five key themes were identified regarding stakeholders' perceptions of preconditioning practices: 1) Ranchers' satisfaction and accountability: the heartbeat of preconditioning, 2) Thriving calves: preconditioning for healthier calves, smooth transition, 3) No gain, no preconditioning: financial incentives drive adoption, 4) The quest for preconditioning proof: buyers struggle without verification, and 5) Supply shortfall: shortage of preconditioned calves during periods of high market demands. Producers who preconditioned their calves were primarily motivated by a sense of personal satisfaction, driven by improved welfare of their calves. In contrast, those who did not practice preconditioning emphasized the lack of a price premium as a significant barrier. While all stakeholders recognized the health benefits and quicker acclimatization of preconditioned calves to the feedlot, auctioneers and feedlot operators reported a lack of reliable verification and the low supply of preconditioned calves as major challenges. We concluded that by implementing third-party verification of preconditioning practices, expanding online auctions tailored to preconditioned calves, and establishing trust and financial incentives can encourage greater adoption of preconditioning practices within the beef industry, ultimately leading to improved animal health, productivity, and welfare.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41076983/,10.1016/j.rvsc.2025.105931

This study evaluates ASP structure in UAE hospitals for seven core elements defined by Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organisation (WHO). A mixed-methods approach across 12 Emirates Health Services (EHS) hospitals, included document reviews, surveys, and expert interviews. Document evaluation was performed on a 3-point Likert scale. Online surveys distributed to a random sample of 385 employees, evaluated ASP dissemination using a 5-point Likert scale, analysed descriptively and through Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests (P<0.05) using SPSS. Interviews with programme experts were thematically analysed using NVIVO. Document analysis showed 6 of 7 ASP core elements fully met, with accountability partially met in all hospitals. The survey (83% response rate) revealed partial ASP dissemination (median = 4, IQR=2) across all elements, with significant differences between employee groups and hospitals (P=0.032). Interviews with 12 ASP experts identified key programme facilitators to be leadership, active interventions, pharmacist engagement, and tailored education. Barriers were inconsistent antibiotic tracking, physician resistance, lack of rapid diagnostics, competency framework and cadre training. EHS ASP demonstrates adequate structure but inconsistent dissemination across hospitals.

41075025,Effects of County Medical Community Central Pharmacy on antibiotic use in primary care: a multicenter quasi-experiment.,"Gao T, Huang S, Shen L, Yin J, Sun Q",2025,International journal of clinical pharmacy,"Antimicrobial resistance poses a growing global health threat and is largely driven by the inappropriate use of antibiotics. Primary healthcare institutions, particularly in low-resource settings, often face challenges, such as limited oversight and irrational prescribing practices. While progress has been made in improving antibiotic stewardship in higher-level hospitals, efforts to optimize prescription in primary healthcare institutions remain insufficient. The County Medical Community Central Pharmacy (CMCP) program was introduced as an integrated intervention to enhance pharmacy services and promote rational antibiotic use through centralized oversight, training, and pharmacist collaboration. This multicenter quasi-experimental study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the CMCP program in reducing antibiotic misuse and improving prescribing rationality in primary healthcare institutions in Shandong Province, China. This multicenter quasi-experimental study was conducted between July and December 2023 in six geographically and economically diverse rural regions of Shandong Province. A total of 37 primary healthcare institutions were included, with 25 voluntarily implementing the CMCP program (intervention group) and 12 continuing routine practices (control group). Data were collected at two time points via structured questionnaires and reviews of 100 randomly selected outpatient prescriptions from each primary healthcare institution. A difference-in-differences (DID) regression model was applied to estimate the impact of the intervention on antibiotic usage and irrational prescribing, controlling for institutional and staffing characteristics. Antibiotic usage rates increased in both groups, but to a lesser extent in the intervention group (from 15.726 to 18.732%; P = 0.006) than in the control group (from 17.682 to 26.582%; P < 0.001). DID analysis showed a mitigating effect on antibiotic use (DID coefficient = - 0.061; P = 0.054). Irrational antibiotic use in the intervention group decreased from 50.660 to 27.655% (P < 0.001), whereas it remained largely unchanged in the control group (36.893% vs. 35.238%). The CMCP program was effective in curbing unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions and enhancing prescription quality in primary healthcare institutions. These findings support the continued implementation and scale-up of CMCP as a strategy to strengthen antibiotic stewardship at the primary care level in resource-limited settings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41075025/,10.1007/s11096-025-02014-x 10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30596-X 10.1016/j.envres.2024.118313 10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.130042 10.1007/s00239-019-09914-3 10.1186/s13756-023-01271-7 10.1001/jama.291.13.1587 10.2147/RMHP.S222200 10.1038/s41598-024-75728-z 10.3390/healthcare12111150 10.3201/eid2804.211975 10.1136/bmjqs-2021-013615 10.1186/s12913-023-09559-5 10.1136/bmjopen-2020-039810 10.1016/j.cmi.2025.02.026 10.1136/bmj.l4016 10.1186/s12992-016-0167-7 10.1186/s12913-021-07300-8 10.1093/jac/dkx469 10.1038/s41598-023-35138-z 10.3390/antibiotics10111356 10.1136/bmjopen-2020-048267 10.3390/antibiotics11070957 10.1016/j.cmi.2022.11.015 10.1186/s13756-020-00821-7 10.26719/2000.6.4.747 10.1080/19371918.2010.525149 10.3390/ijerph192113827 10.1176/appi.ps.202000265 10.3389/fpubh.2022.825328 10.1186/s12939-017-0543-9 10.2147/DHPS.S266749 10.1186/s12879-015-1323-z 10.3390/antibiotics12061027 10.1136/bmjopen-2019-036703 10.3390/healthcare11142019 10.1371/journal.pone.0297340 10.1093/jac/dkx504 10.1371/journal.pmed.1003139 10.1186/s13756-023-01311-2 10.2215/CJN.08140718 10.1093/jac/dkv273 10.1093/cid/ciw658

Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASPs) offer structured, multidisciplinary approach to optimize antibiotic use and mitigate AMR. This study aims to model the cost-effectiveness of implementing an ASP in tertiary care facilities in India. We performed cost-effectiveness analysis from health system perspective using Markov model comparing ASP and non-ASP scenarios in tertiary care hospitals in India. The model simulated 1000 hospitalized patients over daily cycles, with transitions between health states (e.g., development of sensitive or resistant infections, ICU admission, recovery, and death) informed by published literature, local hospital data, and expert opinion. Key outcomes included hospital and ICU days saved, deaths and DALYs averted, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for DALYs averted. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using Monte Carlo simulations to test the robustness of our findings. The ASP scenario achieved total care cost of ₹6.29 million ($74998.06), compared to ₹22.07.09 million ($267263.34485,458.99) in non-ASP setting - 72.0 % cost reduction. ASPs reduced ward, ICU, and overall hospital stay by 677, 187, and 865 days, respectively, and averted 4.9 deaths (5.3 % reduction). All ICURs were negative, demonstrating that ASPs are both cost-saving and more effective. Implementation of ASPs in Indian tertiary care facilities is economically advantageous and clinically beneficial. By reducing healthcare costs, resource utilization, and mortality, ASPs represent a sustainable strategy to mitigate AMR in resource-limited settings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41073237/,10.1016/j.idh.2025.09.003
41072157,Tackling wicked problems through street-level diplomacy: the case of antimicrobial stewardship in Northern Europe.,"McKenna M, Rodrigues C, Brown P, Bradby H, Gale N",2025,Social science & medicine (1982),"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) can be considered a wicked problem because the phenomenon is characterised by multiple, interdependent factors, functioning within ostensibly intractable dynamics. Collaborative or networked governance is often seen as the most appropriate approach to address wicked problems, and there is often scepticism regarding the scalability of micro-level local solutions contributing to neglect in the literature of the role that street-level actors play. Our study focuses on AMR stewardship practices in Northern Europe (Netherlands, Sweden and England), a region which has been relatively successful in controlling antibiotic use in healthcare. We conducted purposively sampled, theoretically-informed, qualitative interviews to explore stewards' practice as policy actors - how they carried out their tasks, worked with others, and dealt with tensions in their role. Using abductive analysis, we demonstrate that participants pursued sustained engagement with antibiotic prescribers and sought creative ways of working with, rather than against, embedded professional values. They deployed deliberative and diplomatic relational practices to build trust. Street-level diplomacy offers a theoretical framework for understanding how policy actors can work in the context of wicked problems. Street-level diplomats operate, with high levels of discretion, within complex, adaptive systems utilising their relational skills to build dynamic forms of influence amongst those implementing policies that have direct impact on citizens and services users. This provides a pragmatic analytical route through the extremes of romanticised calls for 'collaboration' to solve wicked problems or critical perspectives that suggest that wicked problems are intractable.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41072157/,10.1016/j.socscimed.2025.118629

Carriage in young children has been linked to increased morbidity and mortality. However, there is limited information on the prevalence of ESBL-PE among children under five in our settings. This study aimed to determine the fecal carriage of ESBL-PE in children under five years old suffering from diarrhea at a tertiary hospital in Tanzania. This cross-sectional study was conducted over a three-month period at Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Participants' socio-demographic and clinical information were collected using a structured questionnaire and the child's clinic card. Stool samples were collected and screened for the presence of ESBL-PE using MacConkey agar supplemented with ceftazidime. Confirmation of ESBL-PE was achieved through a double disk synergy test. Logistic regression analysis was employed to identify factors independently associated with ESBL-PE carriage. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We enrolled 181 children with a median age of 29 months (interquartile range: 20-37). The female-to-male ratio was 1:1. Among all participants, 54.1% (98/181) were malnourished, and the parents of 54.1% (98/181) had low levels of education. The overall fecal carriage rate of ESBL-PE was 65.7% (119/181). A total of 120 ESBL-PE isolates were confirmed. E. coli was the predominant ESBL-PE, contributing to (74.2%, 89/120), followed by K. pneumoniae (21/120, 17.5%), K. oxytoca (8/120, 6.7%), and Citrobacter spp. (2/120, 1.7%). Malnourished children had a higher carriage rate of ESBL-PE (77.6%) compared to non-malnourished children (51.8%) (p = 0.0003). Prolonged hospital stay (aOR=1.12, 95% CI = 1.05-1.19, p = 0.001), malnourishment (aOR=3.15, 95% CI = 1.61-6.19, p = 0.001), and a history of antibiotic use (aOR=2.28, 95% CI = 1.15-4.54, p = 0.018) were independently associated with the carriage of ESBL-PE. Furthermore, we observed that ESBL-producing E. coli isolated from malnourished children had high resistance rates of 75% and 65% against aztreonam and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, respectively, while ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolated from the same group exhibited high resistance rates of 84.6% and 69.2%. The present study revealed that children under five years old with diarrhea have a higher rate of ESBL-PE fecal carriage. Furthermore, prolonged hospital stays, malnutrition, and a history of antibiotic use are independently associated with ESBL-PE carriage. We also report high resistance rates of ESBL-PE isolated from malnourished children. These findings emphasize the importance of enhancing infection prevention and control measures to mitigate the spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens in both hospital and community settings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41071789/,10.1371/journal.pone.0334051 10.1093/jtm/tax022 10.1093/jacamr/dlaf001 10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101823 10.1016/j.jgar.2022.05.023 10.1097/QCO.0000000000000448 10.3390/nu16010001 10.3201/eid1503.071637 10.1371/journal.pone.0241776 10.1136/bmjgh-2022-009548 10.1186/s12866-023-03102-6 10.3389/fped.2022.880355 10.1371/journal.pone.0299575 10.1016/j.ijid.2022.03.047 10.1016/j.ijmm.2018.06.012 10.1186/s41182-020-00271-2 10.1017/ice.2019.336 10.1371/journal.pone.0258117 10.1186/s12879-020-05272-4 10.1186/s12866-023-03102-6 10.1177/23333928221131709 10.1371/journal.pone.0143729 10.1093/jacamr/dlad051 10.4103/2229-5186.129336 10.1186/s12879-020-05272-4 10.1371/journal.pone.0168024 10.1155/2021/5153237 10.3855/jidc.7593 10.1186/s13756-017-0208-x 10.1093/cid/ciy976 10.3390/antibiotics11070953

This study aimed to identify factors contributing to prolonged time intervals before specialist consultation in South Africa's public healthcare sector, and to inform potential interventions to address these delays. A cross-sectional, survey-based study was conducted. Patients were recruited weekly, and data were collected through individual interviews. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse responses. At initial specialist presentation, 58.9% of patients were diagnosed with stage III/IV disease, with oral cavity malignancies being most common. Nearly half (47.06%) experienced delays because of inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions and misdiagnoses. The median time from symptom onset to specialist review was 135 days. The most frequently cited patient-related barrier was poor health literacy (57.84%). The majority of patients presented with advanced-stage head and neck cancer. Delays were attributed to both clinician-related factors - such as misdiagnosis and unwarranted antibiotic use - and patient-related factors, primarily limited health literacy. The observed median delay exceeds international benchmarks, underscoring the need for targeted interventions. This study highlights the urgent need for earlier referral and specialist assessment of head and neck cancer patients. Findings support the implementation of clinician education, patient awareness initiatives and policy development aimed at reducing diagnostic and referral delays within South Africa's public healthcare system.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41070179/,10.4102/jcmsa.v3i1.215 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60951-X 10.1186/s12889-020-8368-7 10.1371/journal.pone.0192071 10.7196/SAMJ.2019.v109i3.13283 10.1111/jnu.12529 10.1634/theoncologist.2019-0057 10.1001/jamaoto.2019.4311 10.1186/1758-3284-1-14 10.1016/j.radonc.2007.04.001 10.1016/j.oraloncology.2014.12.003 10.1007/s10552-021-01411-7 10.1111/ecc.13718 10.1016/S1368-8375(00)00066-X 10.1111/ecc.13589

However, the implementation of pediatric ASPs presents distinct challenges that set them apart from adult-focused initiatives. Additionally, many existing ASP guidelines are primarily tailored to the U.S. healthcare system, requiring significant adaptation to fit the diverse healthcare infrastructures, resources, and prescribing practices across different countries. These factors highlight the need for context-specific strategies to ensure the effective implementation of pediatric ASPs worldwide. To develop a national, intersociety consensus on pediatric ASPs in Italy, an ASP steering committee was established, bringing together a multidisciplinary group of experts. A systematic scoping review was conducted to identify relevant literature on ASPs and DSPs published between 2007 and August 2024, retrieving 260 articles. Based on this evidence, 33 recommendations were formulated, covering general ASP and DSP principles (10 recommendations), ASP interventions (14), DSP interventions (3), and monitoring strategies (6). Consensus on the importance and feasibility of each recommendation was reached using the Delphi method, with two rounds of anonymous questionnaires. The steering group defined a priori criteria for recommendation acceptance, requiring at least 80% agreement on the importance of each item. This consensus highlights the critical role of a multidisciplinary approach in ASP implementation, supported by institutional leadership. Given the variability in healthcare systems, ASP interventions must be tailored to specific settings, considering factors such as hospital resources, patient complexity, and the parent-child dynamic. Standardized metrics for assessing the impact of ASPs are essential for benchmarking and ensuring sustainability, although data collection remains a significant challenge. While there was strong agreement on the importance of the recommendations, feasibility assessments identified key areas requiring further refinement, particularly in settings with limited pediatric-specific expertise and diagnostic tools. This national consensus provides a structured framework for the implementation of pediatric ASPs in Italy, equipping clinicians with essential tools to optimize antibiotic use in both inpatient and outpatient settings. It represents a foundational step toward improving pediatric ASP, fostering national and international collaboration, and guiding future research to address implementation barriers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41068927/,10.1186/s13052-025-02112-6

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the post-prescription authorization (PPA) of antibiotics in these settings. This retrospective observational study included ER and ACU patients at Siriraj Hospital. In August 2020, a PPA for piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, imipenem/cilastatin, and ertapenem was implemented. These antibiotics were unrestricted for the first 72 h; thereafter, infectious disease physician approval was required. Data from pre-implementation (July 2020) and post-implementation (September 2020) periods were compared. Two-hundred and six patients were included in the study (103 patients each from the pre- and post-implementation periods). There were no significant differences between the groups regarding male sex (49.5% vs. 47.6%;p = 0.78) and age (67.63 ± 22.9 vs. 66.94 ± 17.4 years;p = 0.27). The respiratory tract was the most common infection site, and piperacillin/tazobactam was the most frequently first-prescribed antibiotic. Using too narrow-spectrum antibiotics was the most common reason for inappropriate antibiotic use. The day of therapy/outpatient-day of the target antibiotics was significantly lower in the post-implementation group (0.85 ± 0.41 vs. 0.72 ± 0.39;p = 0.02). Favorable clinical outcomes were significantly higher in the post-implementation group (42.7% vs. 62.1%;p = 0.005).

In this paper, we review novel and rapid sepsis diagnostic techniques compared to traditional methods, emphasizing the significance and efficiency of the emerging technologies. An extensive review of the literature was conducted through databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar with keywords such as ""sepsis"" and ""diagnostic strategies"" to identify the most suitable articles for this review. Effective management of sepsis, a complex and deadly disease, relies on knowledge and application of rapid diagnostic techniques, such as new analytic tools, for successful treatment and improved patient outcomes. Advanced molecular diagnosis and clinical trials are maximizing therapeutic control with biomarker tracking (sTREM-1, IL-6, PCT) and improving diagnostic accuracy. Introducing new technologies in molecular diagnosis, analysis, and clinical management is crucial to improve septic shock patient outcomes. Our review highlights that while traditional methods such as blood culture remain essential, they are limited by long turnaround times and reduced sensitivity. Rapid molecular assays (PCR, MALDI-TOF) and biosensor-based point-of-care platforms provide results within hours, enabling earlier targeted treatment. Among biomarkers, procalcitonin remains the most established, but newer candidates such as presepsin, CXCL5, and circRNAs show promising diagnostic and prognostic potential. Integrating these innovative technologies into clinical workflows can enhance early detection, support antimicrobial stewardship, and ultimately improve patient survival.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41067487/,10.1016/j.cca.2025.120640

To develop and internally validate a concise, clinically interpretable nomogram for EOS risk stratification in preterm neonates and to evaluate its potential for antibiotic stewardship. We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study (July 2023-June 2024) including 1,059 preterm infants admitted within 72 h of birth, randomly split 7:3 into training (n = 742) and validation (n = 317). Forty-five maternal and neonatal candidates were screened (univariable tests, LASSO), followed by multivariable logistic regression to build the final model and nomogram. Discrimination (AUC), calibration (Brier score, calibration curve, Hosmer-Lemeshow), and decision-curve analysis (DCA) were assessed; two biologically plausible interactions were prespecified. Four routinely available variables-gestational age, birth weight, umbilical cord abnormality, and mechanical ventilation within 72 h-composed the final model. In the validation cohort, AUC was 0.818 (95% CI, 0.767-0.868), Brier score 0.158, and Hosmer-Lemeshow P = 0.71; DCA showed net benefit across 5-65% risk thresholds. Using a ≥ 0.70 treatment threshold, the model identified 88% of EOS cases while recommending antibiotics for ~10% of infants. A culture-proven-only sensitivity analysis yielded comparable discrimination (AUC 0.819) with a Brier score 0.041. A four-factor nomogram using EMR-available variables accurately stratifies EOS risk in preterm infants and may support risk-based antibiotic decisions while limiting overtreatment.

41066036,An evaluation of pre-post antimicrobial stewardship healthcare educational intervention studies utilizing the Kirkpatrick model: a scoping review.,"Nasr ZG, Said HM, Barakat KR, Elwan RM, Maklad A, Nazar ZJ",2025,International journal of clinical pharmacy,"Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) education plays a vital role in addressing antimicrobial resistance (AMR), yet its long-term impact on behavior and clinical outcomes remains underexplored. Educational interventions are often assessed through knowledge-based outcomes, with limited evaluation of sustained practice changes or patient-level results, and standardized higher-level outcome measures across diverse healthcare settings. This scoping review aimed to map pre-post AMS healthcare educational interventions using the Kirkpatrick Model, evaluating their effectiveness across its four levels: reaction, learning, behavior, and results. The goal was to identify trends, highlight gaps, and provide insight into reported outcomes, delivery methods, and evaluation tools, supporting future research and strengthening the evidence base for AMS education. This review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute framework. A literature search of nine databases identified studies from 2010 to 2024. Eligible studies included pre-post AMS educational interventions targeting undergraduate students and healthcare professionals (HCPs) and reporting outcomes which were subsequently mapped by the reviewers to the Kirkpatrick Model. Data were categorized by target population, delivery format, and evaluation tools. Narrative synthesis was used to describe trends and relationships. Studies targeted HCPs such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and dental professionals, and undergraduate students in pharmacy, medicine, nursing, and dentistry. Sixty-three studies were included. Outcomes were distributed across Level 1 (Reaction) (n = 46, 24%), Level 2 (Learning) (n = 51, 27%), Level 3 (Behavior) (n = 50, 26%), and Level 4 (Results) (n = 45, 23%). While n = 24 (38%) assessed all four levels, another n = 24 (38%) reported mixed or partial levels. Face-to-face or online-only formats achieved Levels 1 and 2. Whereas blended or workplace-integrated interventions more often demonstrated behavior change and clinical outcomes (Levels 3 and 4). Longitudinal follow-up and mixed evaluation tools (e.g., surveys, chart reviews, interviews) supported higher-level impacts. Pharmacy-led, interdisciplinary, and contextually tailored interventions mapped to all levels. AMS education often leads to short-term learning gains, but fewer interventions achieve sustained behavior change or measurable clinical outcomes. Blended and practice-integrated formats, paired with long-term evaluation, are key to realizing the full potential of AMS education. Embedding such approaches in undergraduate and professional programs can better prepare the future HCPs to address AMR effectively.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41066036/,10.1007/s11096-025-02007-w 10.1007/s11096-023-01574-0 10.1093/cid/ciw118 10.1186/s13756-019-0471-0 10.1093/ijpp/riaa011 10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.028 10.2147/IDR.S290835 10.1186/s12909-022-03542-0 10.5116/ijme.59ba.2d47 10.5688/ajpe8415 10.1186/s12909-019-1623-x 10.11124/JBIES-20-00330 10.1016/j.mcna.2018.05.011 10.1093/jacamr/dlz07 10.3352/jeehp.2016.13.21 10.1016/j.ajpe.2023.02.003 10.1093/jacamr/dlae192 10.1097/00001888-200405000-00006 10.1136/bmj.g7647 10.1097/XEB.0000000000000050 10.3390/antibiotics12101546 10.1080/13561820.2016.1255600 10.1093/jacamr/dlac039 10.5688/ajpe7910157 10.5688/ajpe76587 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.0181 10.1093/ofid/ofw225 10.1136/bmjoq-2023-002327 10.26719/emhj.18.026 10.1016/j.japh.2022.02.016 10.1016/j.ajic.2015.07.004 10.3390/antibiotics10111426 10.1016/j.pedhc.2016.07.005 10.1002/jppr.1413 10.3390/antibiotics11121829 10.1093/ofid/ofac361 10.1016/j.jiac.2023.07.003 10.1016/j.cptl.2021.09.006 10.1016/j.jiph.2019.05.015 10.1111/ans.14414 10.1542/peds.2021-055686 10.1002/jac5.1517 10.1016/j.ajic.2022.05.001 10.1186/s12889-019-6779-0 10.3390/antibiotics11010006 10.1370/afm.2356 10.1016/j.jgar.2020.02.008 10.1016/j.jhin.2021.06.003 10.1186/s12879-020-05309-8 10.1177/00099228211001623 10.1186/1471-2458-14-1276 10.1093/jacamr/dlaa092 10.1016/j.jcjq/2-18.09.002 10.3390/pharmacy9040165 10.1017/ash.2023.171 10.1093/ofid/ofac492.619 10.3390/antibiotics12071192 10.1111/eje.12758 10.1093/ofid/ofad500.1488 10.2196/mededu.7719 10.35845/kmuj.2021.21286 10.37506/mlu.v19i2.747 10.1007/s15010-019-01288-4 10.1177/08971900211018419 10.5530/ijper.57.3.108 10.1016/j.nedt.2022.105362 10.1016/j.cptl.2019.11.016 10.1093/cid/ciac834 10.1016/S1473-3099(19)30573-0 10.1093/jac/dky149 10.1016/j.ijsu.2017.02.040 10.1016/j.cmi.2019.07.009 10.2147/IDR.S324865 10.1093/jac/dky163 10.1093/jac/dkx493 10.3390/antibiotics9100636 10.1016/j.ajic.2017.01.002 10.1111/bcp.13375 10.3390/antibiotics11060791 10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e39630 10.1186/s12909-024-06016-7 10.1093/jacamr/dlae054 10.1186/s12909-024-05503-1 10.1002/hpja.629 10.1080/0142159X.2023.2274137 10.22547/BER/14.2.2

While efforts have predominantly focused on livestock and human medicine, the role of pet owners remains underexplored, despite their direct involvement in antimicrobial administration and influence on veterinary decisions. This study aimed to assess perceptions, knowledge, and practices regarding antimicrobial use and resistance among pet owners in Chile, providing a baseline to inform future education and policy initiatives under a One Health framework. A cross-sectional survey targeting adult dog and cat owners was conducted from May 19 to 21, 2023, in Santiago, Chile, during a large public pet-focused event. Using a validated questionnaire, data were collected on demographics, pet characteristics, knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to antibiotics and AMR. A total of 378 valid responses were analyzed. Descriptive statistics and Chi-square tests were applied to examine associations, particularly between education level and reported practices. Most respondents were female (74.4%) with professional degrees (64%) and aged between 21 and 50 years. Dogs were more commonly owned (73.8%) than cats (26.2%). While 86.2% reported their pet had received antibiotics, only 68.2% recalled veterinarians confirming proper administration understanding. A strong majority agreed that antibiotics should only be used for bacterial infections and opposed acquiring them without a prescription. Notably, 92.4% stated that they would stop treatment early if improvement was observed. Approximately 52% had used human antibiotics for pets, and 38% were open to substituting prescribed veterinary antibiotics with human ones. No significant association was found between education level and antibiotic use behaviors (p > 0.05). Findings reveal important gaps in owner understanding and adherence to antimicrobial guidelines, particularly regarding treatment completion and human antibiotic use in pets. Strengthening veterinarian-owner communication, promoting species-specific antibiotic use, and enhancing awareness of AMR's broader implications are essential.

The antibiotic prescribing rate, measured as defined daily dose (DDD)/1000 persons/day, was stratified by age, sex, socioeconomic status, and clinical indication. Kendall's Tau was used to ascertain temporal trends. In total, 9.3 million records were analyzed. The overall antibiotic prescribing rate was 10.09 DDD/1000 person-day (minimum 8.75/year, maximum 10.64/year) and remained stable over time. The highest rates were observed for senior females (13.92) and in the most deprived areas (10.44) with an increasing trend for the latter (28% increase from 8.59 in 2006 to 11.02 in 2017, P = 0.01). Acute bronchitis (1.01), acute sinusitis (0.97), acute cystitis (0.85), pharyngitis and tonsillitis (0.77), and cellulitis and abscess conditions (0.58) received the most antibiotic prescribing, with an increasing trend for cellulitis and abscess (26% increase [0.49 to 0.62], P = 0.02). In acute cystitis, ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin were the most prescribed, with an increasing trend for nitrofurantoin (71% increase [0.21 to 0.36], P < 0.01). Clarithromycin was the most prescribed in acute sinusitis and acute bronchitis, with a decreasing trend (47% [0.40 to 0.21] and 48% [0.58 to 0.30] decrease, respectively, P = 0.02). In pharyngitis and tonsillitis, amoxicillin was the most prescribed, with a stable rate over time. Cefalexin was the most prescribed in cellulitis and abscess, with an increasing trend (55% increase [0.20 to 0.31], P < 0.01). Acute cystitis, upper respiratory tract, and skin and soft tissue infections warranted most antibiotic prescribing with an increasing trend for the latter.

RéSUMé: OBJECTIF: développer une méthode pour quantifier la consommation d’antibiotiques dans la communauté et déterminer les tendances temporelles en matière de prescription d’antibiotiques pour les indications cliniques les plus courantes en Alberta résidents âgés de 15 ans et plus. MéTHODE: nous avons développé un algorithme permettant de relier les prescriptions figurant dans la base de données des déclarations des praticiens aux délivrances d’antibiotiques enregistrées dans le système d’information pharmaceutique entre 2010 et 2017. Le taux de prescription d’antibiotiques, mesuré en doses définies quotidiennes (defined daily dose, DDD) pour 1000 personnes par jour, a été stratifié selon l’âge, le sexe, le statut socio-économique et l’indication clinique. Le tau de Kendel a été utilisé pour déterminer les tendances temporelles. RéSULTATS: 9.3 millions de données ont été analysées. Dans l’ensemble, le taux de prescription d’antibiotiques était de 10.09 DDD/1000 jours-personnes (minimum: 8.75/an, maximum: 10.64/an) et est resté stable au fil du temps. Les taux les plus élevés ont été observés chez les femmes âgées (13.92) et dans les zones les plus défavorisées (10.44), avec une tendance à la hausse pour ces dernières (augmentation de 28%, passant de 8.59 en 2006 à 11.02 en 2017, P = 0.01). La bronchite aiguë (1.01), la sinusite aiguë (0.97), la cystite aiguë (0.85), la pharyngite et l’amygdalite (0.77) ainsi que la cellulite et les abcès (0.58) ont été les affections les plus fréquemment traitées par antibiothérapie, avec une tendance à la hausse pour la cellulite et les abcès (augmentation de 26% [0.49 à 0.62], P = 0,02). Dans les cas de cystite aiguë, la ciprofloxacine et la nitrofurantoïne ont été les médicaments les plus prescrits, avec une tendance à la hausse pour la nitrofurantoïne (augmentation de 71% [0.21 à 0.36], P < 0.01). La clarithromycine a été principalement prescrite dans les cas de sinusite aiguë et de bronchite aiguë, avec une tendance à la baisse (diminution de 47% [0.40 à 0.21] et de 48% [0.58 à 0.30], respectivement, P = 0.02). Dans les cas de pharyngite et d’amygdalite, l’amoxicilline était le médicament le plus prescrit, avec un taux stable au fil du temps.

41061514,From proposal to podcast: Starting a student-driven pharmacy podcast in the classroom.,"Worden J, Duck J",2025,Currents in pharmacy teaching & learning,"Podcasts are a widely available and popular educational medium for healthcare providers, residents, students, and patients. Podcasts are convenient, accessible, and may be effective education tools for listeners. While some studies have attempted to measure the effectiveness of podcasting to enhance knowledge, there are few studies evaluating podcasts in pharmacy education. The purpose of this project was to provide students with the opportunity to create a podcast episode through an in-class, semester-long assignment and to evaluate student perceptions of knowledge, confidence, and professional identity. Over the course of a semester-long elective class, students worked in groups to develop a 10-min podcast episode on an infectious diseases topic. Students were tasked with creating, recording, and editing content for individual episodes. The podcast episodes were evaluated on accuracy, summary and impact of clinical studies, and production quality. At the end of the semester, a podcast was launched on publicly available platforms and the student podcast episodes were made available for listening. At the conclusion of the semester, students were surveyed on perceived anxiety, confidence, knowledge, and support surrounding the podcast project. Students indicated a notable increase in confidence and knowledge after completing the podcast project. All students were proud of the podcast episode they created and most indicated plans to listen to and share these podcast episodes with others. The creation of a semester-long, student-driven class podcast project is feasible and promotes learning and engagement. Students reported increased confidence, knowledge, and professional pride after completing their podcast episodes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41061514/,10.1016/j.cptl.2025.102506

Pilot cluster randomised controlled trial in 20 general practices in Germany. Practices were assigned 1:1 to POCT-guided management or usual care. All urine samples were sent for urine culture. Follow-up over 28 days involved symptom diaries, telephone interviews, and medical record review. Primary outcomes were recruitment and retention rates. Secondary outcomes included total and inappropriate antibiotic use, symptom duration and burden, recurrent and upper UTIs, re-consultations, and diagnostic accuracy of microscopy versus urine culture. Mixed-effects models accounted for clustering. Over 8 months, 157 women were recruited (90 intervention, 67 control), median of 7.5 patients per practice (range 1-15). Participant retention at day 28 was 75%. Baseline characteristics were well balanced. Antibiotic use was similar in both groups: 77% (intervention) vs. 79% (control) at initial consultation. The mean number of antibiotic courses over 28 days was 0.96 (intervention) vs. 1.00 (control), with no indication of reduced prescribing. Phase-contrast microscopy showed limited diagnostic accuracy, especially for ruling out infection (negative predictive value 46%). Exploratory analyses suggested that if GPs had access to urine culture results at the point of care, antibiotic prescribing in the intervention group could have been higher than in routine care. The POCT-guided management approach for suspected uUTIs is feasible but presents implementation and methodological challenges. Recruitment varied across sites and was lower in the control group practices, highlighting the risk of differential recruitment. Retention was below the expected 80%, indicating the need for efficient follow-up strategies in future trials. Explorative analyses suggest that simply adding diagnostic information may not support antibiotic stewardship. Novel POCTs should be carefully assessed for their influence on prescribing before routine use.

Cultural conventions and the easy accessibility of pharmacies in Saudi Arabia further aggravate this situation. Community pharmacists play a crucial role in antimicrobial stewardship, yet they continue to face substantial challenges. The objective of this study was to examine the barriers and determinants that influence community pharmacists' capability to reduce over-the-counter (OTC) antibiotic sales in the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 269 community pharmacists, utilizing a validated, self-administered questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and ordinal logistic regression to assess associations between demographic characteristics and pharmacists' views of obstacles and stewardship practices. The type of pharmacy was significantly associated with perceived barriers ( The study highlights that systemic and educational factors strongly influence pharmacists' roles in antimicrobial stewardship. This indicates that targeted interventions such as continuous professional education, digital prescription monitoring, and stronger regulatory enforcement are necessary to support pharmacists and reduce the dispensing of inappropriate antibiotics. These measures also align with Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 healthcare priorities. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate these barriers within the Aseer region, offering novel evidence on how organizational and educational contexts shape stewardship practices.

Accurate and timely diagnosis is essential to guide appropriate antibiotic use and minimize unnecessary prescribing. While bacterial culture remains the gold standard, rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) and molecular tests are increasingly implemented. A total of 100 throat swabs were prospectively collected from pediatric patients with suspected GAS pharyngitis. Each sample underwent bacterial culture, RADT, and a molecular test. Sensitivity and specificity of RADT and the molecular test were calculated using culture as the reference. In addition, culture and RADT were also evaluated using the molecular test as the reference standard. In parallel, recommendations from European, North American, and Belgian guidelines were reviewed. When compared to bacterial culture, OSOM® Strep A Test demonstrated a sensitivity of 91% [73-97] and a specificity of 100% [95-100], while ID NOW™ Strep A 2 showed a sensitivity of 87% [67-95] and a specificity of 94% [85-97]. When the molecular test was used as the reference, both bacterial culture and OSOM® Strep A Test exhibited similar sensitivities (83% [64-93] and 80% [60-91], respectively), with high specificities (96% [89-98] and 99% [92-99]). Guideline analysis revealed different approaches to GAS diagnosis, varying in reliance on clinical scores, various routine testing, or confirmatory culture. At the Laboratoire Hospitalier Universitaire de Bruxelles - Universitair Laboratorium Brussel (LHUB-ULB), a rapid antigen detection test is used as the first-line diagnostic tool, with bacterial culture performed for confirmation.

A randomized controlled trial.,"Liu B, Liu J, Ren Y, Xiang J, Xiao B, Sun Y",2025,"International journal of surgery (London, England)","The current gold standard for managing surgical site infections (SSIs) is the vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) technique, also known as vacuum sealing drainage (VSD). However, its high cost and technical complexity necessitate specialized health care personnel for proper application and monitoring, thereby limiting its widespread clinical adoption. Building on the theoretical framework and mechanistic principles of VSD systems, we developed a simplified subcutaneous negative pressure drainage device and conducted a preliminary evaluation of its clinical efficacy and potential for broader implementation. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of a novel, custom-designed simplified subcutaneous negative pressure drainage device for the treatment of SSIs following abdominal surgery. A total of 85 patients who were diagnosed with postoperative incisional infections following abdominal surgery between August 2022 and November 2024 were enrolled as study participants. These patients were randomly allocated using a computer-generated randomization sequence into either a standard care group or an intervention group. The standard care group received standard wound care, including conventional dressing changes, whereas the intervention group was treated with a custom-designed simplified subcutaneous negative pressure drainage device. The primary endpoint was wound healing status. The secondary endpoints included the wound healing time, frequency of dressing changes, cost of wound care, duration of antibiotic therapy, length of hospital stay, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, and patient satisfaction scores. Compared with the standard care group, the intervention group demonstrated superior wound healing outcomes (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the intervention group demonstrated significantly shorter wound healing times, fewer dressing changes, lower wound care costs, a shorter duration of antibiotic use, and shorter hospital stays than did the standard care group (all P < 0.001). Posttreatment CRP and IL-6 levels were significantly lower in both groups (P < 0.001). Patient satisfaction scores were also significantly higher in the intervention group than in the standard care group (P < 0.001).

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) resulting from antibiotic misuse is a major public health challenge, and non-antibiotic interventions (NAIs) may provide a safer means of prevention. This systematic review evaluated non-antibiotic strategies for preventing UTIs during pregnancy as a way to reduce antibiotic prescribing and combat AMR. The review aims to evaluate the role of NAIs in preventing UTIs during pregnancy, with a focus on their potential to reduce antibiotic prescribing and AMR within the NHS care system. A systematic search of Ovid Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus identified studies that compared NAIs to a placebo, usual treatment, or no intervention. Eligible studies included randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, and other relevant designs. Study quality was assessed using established appraisal tools, and a narrative synthesis was conducted due to intervention heterogeneity. Eight studies met the inclusion criteria, examining cranberry products, Mediterranean diet, OM-89 (an oral immunostimulant also known as Uro-Vaxom), ascorbic acid, and knowledge-based interventions. Evidence from seven studies suggests that NAIs may reduce UTI incidence, but the findings are limited, and further research is needed to confirm their effectiveness during pregnancy. The review concludes that NAIs, particularly cranberry products and the Mediterranean diet, may reduce UTI incidence during pregnancy and offer a promising strategy to limit antibiotic use and AMR. However, given the methodological limitations and low quality of available evidence, further high-quality research is required to establish the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of these therapies in pregnant women.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41054432/,10.7759/cureus.93874

We aimed to evaluate the implementation of AMS in ten non-university hospitals in Germany. A pre-existing French score covering key AMS categories (structures, resources and actions) was adapted to the German AMS guidelines and named AMS-GER score. The score was assessed before, during and after the implementation of a bundle of AMS measures. The bundle was implemented as part of the ID ROLL OUT study - a multicentre pre-post interventional study in non-university hospitals in Germany. At baseline, the median AMS-GER score was 37% (range 20-60%), indicating poor implementation in 9 out of 10 hospitals. The intervention resulted in a significant score improvement to 76% (range: 62-86%, p < 0.001). At the one-year follow-up after the intervention, the AMS-GER score had decreased in all hospitals (median: -13 percentage points (range: 48-80%, p = 0.015)). Hospitals with ongoing full-time AMS/ID staffing (4/10 hospitals) experienced a smaller decrease ( - 13 percentage points) than those without ( - 32 percentage points in 6/10 hospitals). Routine integration of AMS in a large sample of non-university hospitals in Germany is low but can be significantly improved by targeted interventions.

This study explores a novel pharmacist working model (resident pharmacists) and evaluates its effectiveness to provide evidence for optimizing pharmaceutical services in intensive care units (ICUs). From February 2024 to January 2025, resident pharmacists were embedded within the Liver ICU as part of a pilot program, delivering multidisciplinary pharmaceutical services including clinical care, teaching, research, and management. Specialized interventions targeting pediatric and infectious disease populations were implemented based on departmental needs. A retrospective analysis was conducted over 12 months to assess the impact of resident pharmacists on pharmaceutical indicators, service quality, and staff satisfaction; key outcome measures included cost reduction, prescribing appropriateness, and antibiotic use metrics. All pharmaceutical management metrics met institutional standards in 2024-2025, including Antibiotic Use Density (AUD; 112.30 vs. threshold 120.47), antimicrobial usage rate (78.68% vs. 88.54%), and proton pump inhibitor prescription rationality (100%). Pharmacists conducted 78 clinical consultations (65.38% multidisciplinary), addressed 132 medication inquiries, developed two clinical guidelines, and achieved full satisfaction scores from medical staff. The average drug cost per patient decreased by 20.05% (RMB 28,806 vs. 36,028 in 2023), with drug cost proportion declining from 30.85% to 23.59%. By deeply participating in various aspects of drug use in the wards, including medical work, management, scientific research cooperation, continuing medical education, resident pharmacists provided more high-quality pharmaceutical services and promote the improvement of pharmaceutical quality control indicators.

Endogenous cases may also arise, particularly in patients with compromised immune systems. A broad spectrum of pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses, can be involved, with some displaying high virulence. Given the rapid progression and potential for vision-threatening complications or systemic involvement such as sepsis, immediate and appropriate intervention is essential. Surgical management, especially vitrectomy, plays a central role in treatment. The Complete Early Vitrectomy for Endophthalmitis (CEVE) protocol has demonstrated high effectiveness, particularly when integrated into outpatient ophthalmic surgical practices. This review describes the protocol's practical application in such settings. In addition, it discusses preventive strategies for ocular surgery and injections, with a particular focus on the judicious use of antimicrobial agents. Incorrect antibiotic use, including unnecessary prescribing, inadequate dosing, or prolonged treatment, remains a leading contributor to the development of antimicrobial resistance and warrants critical evaluation. In summary, the CEVE approach appears to offer broad efficacy across different causes of endophthalmitis. Povidone-iodine (PI) remains the most effective agent for perioperative antisepsis. The use of prophylactic antibiotics should be confined to brief, high-potency topical therapy following intraocular procedures, including cataract surgery and phacovitrectomy. Current evidence does not support the routine use of prophylactic antibiotics after intravitreal injections due to minimal benefit and the risk of promoting resistant organisms.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41049958/,10.7759/cureus.91513

The objective of this study was to assess the guideline consistency of antibiotic prescriptions for AOM and CAP in a Canadian quaternary care pediatric emergency department (ED) and identify opportunities to improve antibiotic prescribing. We retrospectively reviewed antibiotic prescriptions for patients 0 to 18 years old discharged from the ED with a diagnosis of AOM or CAP from September 2022 through September 2023. Clinical information and prescription data were extracted from the electronic medical record. Analysis was completed using descriptive statistics. Of 2313 retrieved records, 1143 (85%) cases of AOM and 753 (75%) cases of CAP met the inclusion criteria. Six hundred and eighty-eight (60%) AOM prescriptions and 140 (19%) CAP prescriptions were guideline-consistent. Prescriptions were not guideline-consistent largely because of antibiotic duration (62% for AOM-67% attributable to excess duration; 93% for CAP- > 99% attributable to excess duration), followed by antibiotic dosing interval (31% for AOM; 22% for CAP), antibiotic selection (17% for AOM; 6% for CAP) and antibiotic dose (8% for AOM; 2% for CAP). Of 293 patients eligible for deferred prescriptions for AOM based on age and clinical presentation, only 52% received them. Most guideline-discordant prescriptions for both AOM and CAP resulted from prolonged antibiotic duration.

This study was aimed at assessing the level of awareness and knowledge regarding antibiotic use and withdrawal periods and understanding the factors that influence AMR awareness in rural Zimbabwe. Data was gathered from 17,895 households in all 60 rural districts in Zimbabwe through a household survey. Descriptive statistics and adjusted Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression models were used to identify predictors of AMR awareness and safe food handling behaviours. Findings revealed limited (18.3 %) awareness of AMR, with notable disparities across education levels and religious affiliations. Higher educational attainment and wealth status were positively associated with both AMR awareness and food safety knowledge. On the other hand, households affiliated with conservative religious groups or those with larger family sizes demonstrated significantly lower adherence to recommended practices. The study underscores the intersection of behavioural, social, and structural determinants in shaping food safety and AMR-related behaviours.

41049349,Effectiveness of Aspirin Plus Dipyridamole Versus Clopidogrel in Preventing Recurrent Ischemic Stroke: A Systematic Review.,"Osayagbon AE, Olaniyi AO, Oyovwi J, Banerjee A, Lawal OP, Butt MA",2025,Cureus,"This systematic review evaluated the comparative effectiveness of aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole (Asp+Dp) versus clopidogrel in preventing recurrent ischemic stroke. Three eligible studies were included, enrolling a total of 21,752 participants with a cumulative follow-up of 32 months. Many participants were recruited from the large-scale PROFESS trial (20,332 participants). Intervention dosing consisted of aspirin 25 mg combined with extended-release dipyridamole 200 mg administered twice daily, while the comparator was clopidogrel 75 mg once daily. In the PROFESS trial, recurrent stroke occurred in 916 patients (9.0%) in the Asp+Dp group and 898 patients (8.8%) in the clopidogrel group. The combined risk of recurrent stroke or major haemorrhagic events was comparable between groups, affecting 1,194 participants (11.7%) receiving Asp+Dp and 1,156 participants (11.4%) receiving clopidogrel. With respect to antiplatelet activity, one randomised pilot study demonstrated that Asp+Dp was associated with a delayed but significant reduction in the expression of several activation-dependent platelet receptors. Conversely, clopidogrel monotherapy was associated with earlier and more potent antiplatelet activity. Clinically, these study findings suggest that clopidogrel exerts more potent and earlier antiplatelet effects, whereas Asp+Dp produces broader but delayed downregulation of multiple platelet activation pathways. Regarding functional outcome recurrence, mortality, bleeding risk, or serious adverse events in patients with acute, mild ischemic stroke, no significant differences were observed between Asp+Dp and clopidogrel, with both regimens being practical and feasible for clinical use. In conclusion, while both therapies demonstrate comparable clinical effectiveness, further research is warranted to evaluate their long-term impact on quality of life in patients with ischemic stroke.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41049349/,10.7759/cureus.93790

Despite global calls to action, gaps between recommendations and practice persist, largely due to system factors shaping clinical work. This review examines how systems approaches have been applied to the use and governance of antimicrobials. This scoping review followed PRISMA-ScR. Eligible sources included empirical studies, reviews, protocols, theses/dissertations, and improvement projects across healthcare settings in high-income countries. Studies required explicit use of systems approaches. EMBASE, MEDLINE, and CINAHL were searched in November 2024. Grey literature was added in February 2025. Search was updated in July 2025. Three researchers extracted data on study characteristics, systems approaches, and organisational implications. Review was preregistered (https://osf.io/p3xsf). 25 articles were ultimately included. Seven focused on acute care and 18 leveraged interviews. Among studies involving participants (n = 18), 12 involved only frontline level participants, four involved participants from different organisational levels with a focus on frontline settings, and two focused on management settings. Implications of the use of systems approaches were identified across three organisational levels: micro (patient care), meso (management), and macro (leadership). This is the first review to map the implications of systems approaches for AMR at different organisational levels. Findings suggest gaps in the application of systems approaches at levels most responsible for strategic decisions and implementation. Given recent criticism about safety management and calls for strong AMS leadership, this gap represents a missed improvement opportunity. Future research should explore how alignment toward AMS is impacted due to system factors within and between organisational levels.

This study explored the decision-making process regarding antibiotic use for ARS among general practitioners (GPs) and doctors in training working in general practice. Nine semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 doctors. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using systematic text condensation. Four key themes were developed: (1) 'It all starts before the consultation': staff-led triage shaping ARS care, (2) two diagnostic worlds: experienced intuition vs. rule-bound caution, (3) C-reactive protein (CRP) in the crossfire: guide, reassurance or irrelevant in antibiotic decision-making and (4) 'Sometimes it's a negotiation': managing patient expectations without losing stewardship. Although diagnosing ARS was often straightforward, distinguishing bacterial from viral infections proved difficult. C-reactive protein testing was common, but its reliability was questioned. Antibiotic prescribing decisions were influenced by patient history, comorbidities and risk factors. While antibiotics were rarely considered necessary initially, patient expectations and doctor-patient relationships sometimes influenced prescribing. This study illustrates the complexity of diagnosing and managing ARS, shaped by clinical uncertainty, competing priorities and non-clinical pressures. Variation in doctor involvement, diagnostic practices and CRP thresholds reveals the challenges of standardization. Training, guidelines and patient education are valued but may not ensure optimal antibiotic use. Diagnostic decisions are relational, negotiated and context-specific, influenced by public health concerns, patient needs and workflow demands. Without acknowledging this complexity, antibiotic stewardship efforts could potentially fall short.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41044985/,10.1080/02813432.2025.2568043

In Africa, up to one-third of patients undergoing surgery may be affected by an SSI, and high rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) pose an additional threat. Data on the epidemiology and microbiology of these infections are needed but scarce. This prospective, observational, pilot study investigated the incidence, risk factors, and microbial spectrum of SSI. All consenting patients undergoing surgery at Mbouo Protestant Hospital in Cameroon were included. An active SSI surveillance system was established and continued after discharge. Data collection took place from April 2021 to February 2022. Risk factors for SSI and for mortality were recorded as well as microbial data. The SSI incidence and the Odd's ratios were calculated. One hundred forty-eight patients were included. The total SSI incidence was 7% (11/148) with 3% (2/67) for Obstetrics/Gynaecology, 3% (1/30) for General Surgery and 16% (8/51) for Orthopaedics/Trauma. About 55% (6/11) of SSI appeared after discharge from hospital. Risk factors for SSI were Orthopaedic/trauma procedure, dirty/infected wounds, high intraoperative blood loss and long duration of the operation. The total postoperative mortality was 3% (4/148) with 0% (0/67) for Obstetrics/Gynaecology, 10% (3/30) for General Surgery and 2% (1/51) for Orthopaedics/Trauma. Mortality risk factors were laparotomy, high ASA class and high age. Multi-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacteria were the main SSI germs. All (2/2) of the non-AMR SSI wounds healed until the end of the study in contrast to only 25% (1/4) of the AMR SSI, all of the non-healed being orthopaedic AMR SSI. This pilot study reveals a significant burden of SSIs, AMR and perioperative mortality at a district hospital in Cameroon. Despite its limitations, the study identified critical areas for improvement, including developing adapted guidelines for orthopaedic SSIs, improving the implementation of SSI prevention guidelines, and enhancing perioperative antimicrobial stewardship.

However, their excessive and inappropriate use is leading to the emergence of antibiotic resistance, a major public health problem worldwide. Pregnant women's attitudes and knowledge about the use of antibiotics have a significant impact on their practice and, consequently, on maternal and infantile child health. This study therefore aims to assess the knowledge, attitudes and self-reported practices of pregnant women regarding the appropriate use of antibiotics. It also seeks to identify the factors associated with the irrational use of antibiotics by pregnant women in the city of Marrakech. This was a cross-sectional study conducted between January and April 2022. The study population included all women receiving postnatal care in birthing centers or during vaccination sessions in health centers in the city of Marrakech. Using a self-administered questionnaire, we collected data on women's knowledge of antibiotic use, attitudes and self-reported practices during pregnancy. Regression analysis was performed to identify the factors associated with the irrational use of antibiotics by pregnant women in the city of Marrakech. Out of 292 women, 58.2% (n = 170) of pregnant women used antibiotics during their pregnancy. The use of prescription antibiotics represents 76.1% (n = 137) and 23.9% (n = 43) self-medicated. The most commonly used antibiotics were amoxicillin (n = 91, 53.5%) and amoxicillin clavulanic acid (n = 79, 46.5%). The symptoms most frequently reported by pregnant women were respiratory (n = 97, 53.9%), urinary (n = 38, 21.1%) and otorhinolaryngological (n = 24, 13.3%). The multiple logistic regression model showed that women's family structure and level of education were significantly associated with knowledge. The number of consultations was significantly associated with attitudes. Family structure, level of education, number of children, number of consultations and place of birth were significantly associated with practice. This study highlighted knowledge gaps and misconceptions about antibiotics among pregnant women, as well as inappropriate attitudes and practices that encourage suboptimal use of these drugs. These results indicate the need to develop targeted educational programs to improve understanding and appropriate practice of the use of antibiotics during pregnancy.

While veterinary surgeons, physicians, and ecologists are typically emphasized in One Health discourse, the role of university-trained veterinary nurses-whose formal recognition remains nascent in parts of Europe-has received limited attention. Veterinary nurses occupy pivotal positions in clinical practice, implementing infection prevention protocols, conducting zoonotic disease surveillance, and maintaining hygiene standards among staff and clients. They support antimicrobial stewardship through responsible administration and client education, reducing the emergence of resistant pathogens. Additionally, veterinary nurses enhance animal welfare via behavioural assessments, safeguard food safety by supporting livestock health, and facilitate animal-assisted therapy through rigorous evaluation of therapy animals' health and behaviour. Their involvement in disaster response sustains animal health services, contributing to community resilience. As trusted professionals, veterinary nurses also serve as public health educators, leveraging their relationships with animal owners to promote evidence-based guidance on zoonoses prevention, biosecurity, and responsible antimicrobial use. Despite these multifaceted contributions, veterinary nursing practice in Europe is constrained by heterogeneous educational standards, inconsistent legal recognition, and limited participation in policy forums. Professional advocacy has driven incremental reforms; however, systematic harmonization of curricula, regulatory frameworks, and interdisciplinary collaboration remains essential.

41029889,Factors influencing the use of microbiology services: A cross-sectional study in Ethiopian public hospitals.,"Akililu KK, Tarekegn W, Kasa ZS, Tessema MS, Mamo BT, Berhane Y",2025,"Journal of health, population, and nutrition","Empiric management of infectious diseases is prevalent in low-resource settings. This has resulted in the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance. In Ethiopia, there is scarce evidence on the extent of use and factors influencing the utilization of microbiologic services in routine clinical practice. This study aims to address this gap. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 400 clinicians from eight public hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. After obtaining informed consent, participants completed a self-administered questionnaire. The collected data was cleaned and analyzed using SPSS 27, with binomial and multinomial regression tests performed to measure statistical association between identified factors and microbiologic service utilization. Two-hundred-twelve (53.0%) of the 400 clinicians had limited knowledge on the availability and/or types of microbiologic services provided in their facilities. Only fifty-nine (14.8%) consistently sent out culture tests when clinically indicated. The primary reasons for clinicians' reluctance to prescribe culture tests included perceived gaps in availability, turnaround time, completeness of antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) panels, and lack of concordance with clinical pictures. Besides their overall impact on diagnostic stewardship, these gaps have also left a negative impression on prescribers. Discordance with clinical profile (AOR = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.88, P = 0.03), and incomplete AST panels (AOR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.11, 0.94, P = 0.04) have negatively affected the perception interviewed clinicians had on reliability of services provided. The findings highlight key areas for targeted intervention in the knowledge, attitudes, and use of microbiology services in public healthcare, largely due to concerns about service quality and timeliness. The determinant factors identified present opportunities to improve laboratory services and better support clinicians in their practice. Despite the critical role of culture and sensitivity tests in combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR), their use remains limited. This underscores the urgent need for coordinated action to strengthen microbiology services as a key strategy in the fight against AMR.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41029889/,10.1186/s41043-025-01081-0

Despite WHO guidelines against antibiotics for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 cases without bacterial co-infection, significant misuse has been reported globally. This study aimed to evaluate antibiotic consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic at a hospital in North Macedonia and to analyze adherence to WHO guidelines, with a focus on antimicrobial stewardship, using the ATC and WHO AWaRe classification systems. To analyze antibiotic utilization trends from January 2020 to December 2021 and assess adherence to WHO guidelines, focusing on the potential impact on AMR. This retrospective observational study measured antibiotic consumption in defined daily doses (DDD) per 100 occupied bed-days (DDD/100 OBD) using ATC and WHO AWaRe classifications. Data were obtained only from ICU inpatients treated at the Clinical Hospital in Shtip, North Macedonia. Trends in annual consumption were analyzed, including rate-of-change calculations for individual antibiotics between 2020 and 2021. Total antibiotic consumption decreased from 2902.6 DDD/100 OBD in 2020 to 2286.5 DDD/100 OBD in 2021. A third-generation cephalosporin, ceftriaxone, was the most consumed antibiotic, accounting for 57.62% of total consumption in 2020 and 48.55% in 2021. Tetracycline use slightly increased from 13.88% in 2020 to 15.83% in 2021. Fluoroquinolone use decreased significantly from 15.22% in 2020 to 6.5% in 2021. Carbapenem consumption rose sharply from 1.7% in 2020 to 14.37% in 2021, while azithromycin use declined threefold. Antibiotics in the Access group accounted for less than 20% of total usage, while those in the Watch group predominated. The study highlights a continued reliance on broad-spectrum antibiotics during the pandemic, diverging from WHO recommendations emphasizing Access to antibiotics. These trends suggest inadequate implementation of antimicrobial stewardship practices and raise concerns about their long-term impact on AMR. Limitations include the retrospective, single-center design, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. The findings underscore the high dependency on Watch category antibiotics and a limited focus on Access antibiotics, contrary to WHO recommendations. This highlights the urgent need for robust antimicrobial stewardship programs to control inappropriate antibiotic use and combat AMR.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41029017/,10.2174/0115748863385928250911004158

Evidence suggests that over three-quarters of premature deaths can be prevented through cost-effective interventions. However, compliance with evidence-based guidelines in neonatal care often falls <50%, even in well-resourced settings. The study evaluated system gaps using WHO Quality Assessment/Quality Improvement Tool for Maternal and Newborn Care (WHO QA/QI MN) and implemented Point of Care Quality Improvement (POCQI) methodology to improve and sustain the composite outcome of mortality and/or major morbidities, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis stage 3, late-onset sepsis and intraventricular haemorrhage grade ≥3. The study was conducted over 14 months. The adapted WHO QA/QI MN tool and POCQI methodology were used to focus on key clinical practices, namely, kangaroo mother care (KMC), use of mother's own milk (MoM) and antibiotic usage, utilising multiple plan-do-study-act cycles. Among 961 preterm neonates enrolled, KMC rates increased from 70.25% to 85.58%, and exclusive MoM use by day 7 increased from 59.24% to 70.2%. Antibiotic use declined from 25.5% to 20.67%. While process improvements were noted, the composite outcome of mortality and major morbidities did not show statistically significant reduction; however, a decreasing trend was observed post-intervention. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using the WHO tool by trained personnel for gap analysis. POCQI is an important approach to enhance evidence-based care practices and sustain good outcomes for preterm neonates in resource-limited settings. A longer follow-up may be needed to observe significant improvements in clinical outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41027681/,10.1136/bmjoq-2025-003420 10.1056/NEJM198501103120204 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60820-4 10.1016/j.ebiom.2015.05.023 10.1016/S2214-109X(18)30386-3 10.1136/bmjqs.2009.037895 10.1136/qhc.12.6.458 10.5455/aim.2012.20.226-234 10.7189/jogh.10.020433 10.1186/s12913-020-5065-2 10.1093/intqhc/mzab028 10.1136/bmjoq-2021-001459 10.1136/bmjoq-2021-001775 10.1016/j.pedn.2022.09.011 10.1038/sj.jp.7210999 10.1371/journal.pone.0125643 10.1007/s12098-017-2306-4 10.1016/j.ijpam.2018.12.003 10.1038/s41372-020-0707-0 10.1038/sj.jp.7211758 10.1159/000370058 10.1038/jp.2013.2 10.1136/bmjoq-2021-001456 10.1038/s41372-018-0041-y 10.1136/bmjoq-2021-001470 10.1136/bmjoq-2017-000285 10.1136/bmjoq-2021-001474 10.1097/CCM.0000000000003463 10.1542/peds.2015-0389 10.1503/cmaj.190940 10.1093/ije/dyq031 10.1038/sj.jp.7211283 10.1016/j.jped.2013.01.009

Its prevalence has increased due to the aging population and increased antibiotic resistance. Early identification and the use of innovative technologies are crucial for improving patient outcomes. Modern methodologies are needed to minimize the turnaround time for diagnosis and improve outcomes. Rapid diagnostic tests and multiplex PCR are effective but have limitations in identifying a range of pathogens and target genes. Our study evaluated two novel probe-based multiplex real-time PCR systems: the SEPSI ID and SEPSI DR panels. These systems can quickly identify bacterial and fungal pathogens, alongside antibiotic resistance genes. The assays cover 29 microorganisms (gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria, yeast, and mold species), alongside 23 resistance genes and four virulence factors. A streamlined workflow uses 2 µL of broth from positive blood cultures (BCs) without nucleic acid extraction and provides results in approximately 1 h. We present the results from an evaluation of 228 BCs and 22 isolates previously characterized by whole-genome sequencing. In comparison to the reference methods, the SEPSI ID panel demonstrated a sensitivity of 96.88%, a specificity of 100%, and a PPV of 100%, whereas the SEPSI DR panel showed a sensitivity of 97.8%, a PPV of 89.7%, and a specificity of 96.7%. Both panels also identified additional pathogens and resistance-related targets not detected by conventional methods. This assay shows promise for rapidly and accurately diagnosing sepsis. Future studies should validate its performance in various clinical settings to enhance sepsis management and improve patient outcomes.IMPORTANCEWe present a new diagnostic method that enables the quick and precise identification of pathogens and resistance genes from positive blood cultures, eliminating the need for nucleic acid extraction. This technique can also be used on fresh pathogen cultures. It has the potential to greatly improve treatment protocols, leading to better patient outcomes, more responsible antibiotic use, and more efficient management of healthcare resources.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41025980/,10.1128/spectrum.00559-25
41025489,Norwegian Anaesthesiologist's Perspectives on Perioperative Allergies and Penicillin Allergy Evaluations: A National Survey.,"Alnæs MB, Guttormsen AB, Terreehorst I, Oppegaard O, Kittang BR, Schaufel MA, Savic L, Storaas T",2025,Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,"Penicillin allergy is a frequent challenge in perioperative antibiotic stewardship. Although 3%-10% of hospitalised patients declare a penicillin allergy, up to 95% of penicillin allergy labels are refuted through allergologic testing. Identifying incorrect penicillin allergy labels reduces the consumption of broad-spectrum second-line antibiotics, benefiting patients and society. Penicillin allergy evaluation is a recommended action for fighting antimicrobial resistance, and the procedure is under-facilitated perioperatively. Anaesthesiologists are important stakeholders in perioperative antibiotic stewardship, but knowledge about their attitudes and potential barriers to adopting penicillin allergy evaluation is scarce. We conducted a national, cross-sectional online survey among 1667 members of the Norwegian Anaesthesiology Association. The study was informed by the British Drug Allergy Labels in Elective Surgical Patients anaesthesiologist survey. The survey examined knowledge about perioperative allergies and penicillin allergy evaluations. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively, and qualitative data were analysed using systematic text condensation. We received 405 responses (24% response rate). Barriers to penicillin allergy evaluation included: (1) a perceived lack of knowledge, (2) time constraints and the absence of structured workflows, and (3) not feeling responsible for evaluating penicillin allergies. If respondents believed that the declared penicillin allergy was highly unlikely to represent a true allergy, 65% would administer penicillin. However, in patients de-labelled by oral provocation testing with penicillin, 34% of the respondents would still not re-expose the patient to penicillins. Senior clinicians expressed the lowest confidence in evaluating penicillin allergies, and respondents were mostly unaware of national penicillin allergy evaluation guidelines. Distrust in penicillin allergy evaluation procedures is prevalent among Norwegian anaesthesiologists. Key barriers to the implementation of perioperative penicillin allergy evaluation include time constraints, insufficient knowledge and unclear clinical responsibilities. To improve commitment, targeted education, specialty-specific guidelines, a simplified drug allergy warning system, and clearly defined roles are essential. We compared our results with results from the UK and found similar challenges. As our findings reflect challenges reported in other European countries, we call for a coordinated European initiative to enhance the implementation of perioperative penicillin allergy evaluations. Increasing anaesthesiologists' engagement in penicillin allergy evaluation can potentially improve perioperative outcomes and reduce antimicrobial resistance. This survey study assessed clinician opinions of penicillin allergy evaluation in one Scandinavian country. The authors present suggestions for improving the process for evaluation of suspected penicillin allergy as part of a general clinician responsibility for antibiotic treatment stewardship.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41025489/,10.1111/aas.70129 10.1111/aas.13066

This study aims to assess physicians' awareness and attitudes towards AMR and appropriate antimicrobial use across different medical specialties in Japan. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted from January 31 to February 5, 2024, among 280 physicians from three specialties (internal medicine, pediatrics, and otorhinolaryngology) who were working in outpatient clinics in Japan. Participants were asked about their familiarity with the National Action Plan (NAP) on AMR and the manuals of Ministry of Health and Labor Welfare (MHLW) on prudent antimicrobial use. Their opinions on AMR facts and antibiotic use were also surveyed using five-point Likert scales. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, multilevel mixed-effects ordered logistic regression and generalized linear models to examine factors influencing NAP/manuals adherence. Most respondents were male (85%) and predominantly aged 50 and above (73.9%), Familiarity with the AMR Action Plan varied, with 36.4% of respondents reported understanding its content, while 37.5% only knew its name. Similarly, 27.1% of respondents used the MHLW manuals, whereas 48.6% were aware of them but did not use them. Internal medicine physicians showed the highest adherence to antimicrobial stewardship and most concern about AMR facts, while pediatricians demonstrated the highest adherence to MHLW manuals (AOR = 2.4, p = 0.000 compared to internal medicine doctors). Otorhinolaryngologists reported higher awareness of NAP (AOR = 2.6, p = 0.006 compared to internal medicine doctors) but had the lowest adherence to NAP and MHLW manuals. Younger physicians (< 50 years) were more proactive in addressing AMR and adhering to antimicrobial stewardship than older physicians. Messages emphasizing the prevention of drug resistance and societal impacts of AMR were most associated with positive attitudes from physicians in outpatient clinics. This study highlights significant variability in AMR awareness and adherence across specialties and age groups. Internal medicine physicians showed the highest adherence, while pediatricians were the most familiar with AMR manuals. Otorhinolaryngologists demonstrated strong awareness but lower adherence. Targeted educational interventions, particularly focusing on older physicians and specific specialties, are needed to improve antimicrobial use and combat the growing threat of resistance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41023885/,10.1186/s12879-025-11583-1

This study assessed public understanding and misuse of antibiotics in China to inform targeted interventions. Data were extracted from the Psychology and Behaviour Investigation of Chinese Residents (2024), including 25,047 respondents over the age of 18 years. The study evaluated antibiotic knowledge, use practices, and associated factors using validated electronic health literacy scales. Of the 25,047 respondents, 59.1% (14,806/25,047) reported having heard about antibiotics, with 34.8% (5154/14,806) correctly identifying their function. Regarding antibiotic use, 49.3% (7292/14,806) reported purchasing antibiotics without prescription at least once; 36.8% (5454/14,806) did not follow physicians' instructions specifically, 15.1% (2235/14,806) discontinued their medication independently, 9.4% (1391/14,806) adjusted their doses, and 16.6% (2457/14,806) stopped taking the antibiotic immediately after their symptoms disappeared during the treatment. Female (OR = 0.843, 95% CI: 0.790-0.900), minority (OR = 0.786, 95% CI: 0.674-0.917) and rural respondents (OR = 0.812, 95% CI: 0.743-0.887) were less likely to have a correct knowledge of antibiotics.

We queried the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric for all patients age <90 days undergoing select thoracoabdominal surgical procedures between 2021 and 2023. Procedures were further subcategorized by anatomic site. SAP regimens were classified as being ""adherent,"" ""undercoverage,"" or ""overcoverage"" per established guidelines and expert consensus. The primary outcome was surgical site infection (SSI). Associations between SAP classification and SSI rates for each procedure subcategory were analyzed, with further subset analyses to delineate the effects of common SAP regimens on postoperative outcomes. A total of 11 062 cases met criteria, with an overall SAP adherence of 87.2%. Rates of overcoverage (2.8%-55.5%) and undercoverage (2.8%-28.3%) varied widely by procedure type. SAP undercoverage did not increase the odds of SSI for most procedures analyzed, with the exception of patients undergoing colorectal procedures, in whom cefazolin monotherapy (undercoverage) was associated with higher odds of SSI (OR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.08-4.18). Broadening SAP coverage (overcoverage) and prolonging SAP duration were not associated with reduced SSI rates for any subcategory of procedure. Adherence to empiric SAP guidelines was poor among neonates and very young infants undergoing surgical intervention. There appears to be limited benefit to broadening SAP coverage for surgery in this patient population. These findings underscore the need for increased adherence to recommendations driven by neonatal-specific data, aiming to balance optimized postoperative outcomes with antimicrobial stewardship goals.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41016460/,10.1016/j.jpeds.2025.114839

We analysed antibiotic use patterns, farm management practices, and factors influencing use among 398 semi-intensive poultry farms in Thai Nguyen province, Vietnam. Data on antibiotic use and mortality during the last production cycle, and biosecurity measures were collected using a structured questionnaire and analyzed descriptively and statistically. Antibiotic use was reported by 77 % of intensive farms, 70 % medium-scale farms and 33 % small-scale farms, with 76 %, 59 % and 54 % of these respectively, indicating use for therapeutic purposes. Doxycycline and Amoxicillin were the most used antibiotics on intensive and medium-scale farms, while tylosin and amoxicillin were common on small-scale farms. Biosecurity levels were low across all farm types, although intensive farms reported higher implementation. Farmers prioritised external biosecurity measures, particularly those related to infrastructure, biological vectors, and feed and water management. Mortality rates were low, averaging 1.5 % on intensive farms, 3 % on medium-scale farms, and 1.7 % on small-scale farms. In small-scale farms, antibiotic use was significantly associated with the presence of other poultry types (OR: 3.3), farmers' perception of antibiotic effectiveness (OR: 2.3), having a fence (OR=3.3) and high morbidity (OR=1.1). Storing feed on elevated floors reduced likelihood of use (OR=0.2). On medium-scale farms, high morbidity (OR=1.3) and storing feed in a separate room (OR=3.5) were linked to increased use.

We aimed to describe the results of surveillance of gonococcal AMR conducted globally by WHO and discuss the actions needed to retain our ability to treat gonorrhoea. In this retrospective observational study, we present gonococcal AMR data reported to WHO by 77 countries between Jan 1, 2019, and Dec 31, 2022. Gonococcal isolates were tested for minimum inhibitory concentrations of one to four key antimicrobials (ceftriaxone, cefixime, azithromycin, and ciprofloxacin) in each country. We used breakpoints for resistance and decreased susceptibility to antimicrobials from the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing or Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute. 29 (39%) of 75 participating countries reported at least one isolate with resistance or decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone, 28 (50%) of 56 reported resistance or decreased susceptibility to cefixime, 58 (88%) of 66 reported resistance to azithromycin, and 74 (99%) of 75 reported resistance to ciprofloxacin. Globally, azithromycin resistance is increasing, as is resistance or decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone and cefixime, especially in the WHO Western Pacific region. Resistance to ciprofloxacin remained very high globally. Since 2017-18, the numbers of reporting countries, examined isolates, and resistant isolates have increased. However, surveillance levels remain inadequate in central America and the Caribbean, eastern Europe, and the WHO African, Eastern Mediterranean, and South-East Asia regions. Global AMR surveillance conducted by WHO is expanding and, in selected countries, improving through standardisation and quality assurance, as well as implementation of extragenital sampling, test of cure, and whole-genome sequencing. This approach provides evidence-based data for management guidelines and public health policies. Improvements in prevention, early diagnosis, treatment of patients and their contacts, surveillance (of infection rates, AMR, treatment failures, and antimicrobial use), and antimicrobial stewardship are essential. WHO supports this work through several global action plans on AMR, new global gonorrhoea treatment recommendations, surveillance, and research.

Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programs optimize use. This prospective interventional study outlines a five-year antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) in Bahrain's primary health care (PHC) facilities. A prospective interventional study was conducted in Bahrain's governmental PHC centers to evaluate the impact of a newly implemented ASP on antimicrobial use and cost. Starting in 2015, the ASP included a situational analysis of prescribing patterns and resources. A multidisciplinary team was formed to guide AMS activities, develop educational programs, establish clinical guidelines, create an electronic prescribing reporting system, and provide feedback on prescribing trends. The study analyzed antimicrobial prescription order reports and evaluated all antimicrobials prescribed between January 2016 and September 2021, assessing antimicrobial prescription per 1000 inhabitants, defined daily doses (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants, and antimicrobial costs. A total of 2032,653 prescription were ordered between January 2016 and September 2021, with penicillins (68.74 %), cephalosporins (18.13 %), and antiparasitics (9.43 %) being the most common. Over 70 % of the PHC prescriptions were from the WHO-recommended Access category for the whole study period. After AMS interventions, prescriptions decreased 4.5-fold, from 67.6 to 15.1 prescriptions per 1000 inhabitants, with statistically significant reductions (P < 0.001) in all antimicrobial classes except nitrofurantoin. The DDD/1000 inhabitants, and cost also decreased significantly (P < 0.001), saving around 4.1 million Bahraini Dinars, ($10.97 million). The first published country wide ASP in primary health care in the Eastern Mediterranean significantly reduced antimicrobial prescriptions and DDD/ 1000 inhabitants. Leadership support, multifaceted interventions, and active multidisciplinary participation are key to sustaining and improving outcomes at a country scale. Further analysis can identify additional gaps and necessary system changes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41014968/,10.1016/j.jiph.2025.102971
41013706,Periprosthetic joint infection after arthroplasty: advances and future prospects.,"Xiong X, Xu J, Zhou B, Luo M, Gao J, Bi Q, Ying Q, Zhang J",2025,Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,"To comprehensively analyze the prevention, diagnosis and management strategies of periprosthetic joint infections(PJIs), provide new ideas for overcoming PJI, and provide references for clinicians. By synthesizing the latest research results at home and abroad, this study deeply analyzed the multidimensional prevention strategies, diagnostic criteria and technological advances, and treatment management strategies for PJI. The management of PJI remains a significant challenge in orthopedic surgery, which warrants focused attention. The prevention of PJI holds paramount priority and should be integrated throughout the perioperative period. Although diagnostic criteria for PJI have undergone multiple updates, the 2011 MSIS criteria remain the most widely adopted, requiring comprehensive evaluation of laboratory, pathological, and imaging examinations for diagnosis. PJI treatment necessitates combined antibiotic and surgical interventions. Antibiotic therapy includes empirical treatment after diagnosis, targeted therapy following pathogen identification, and suppressive antibiotic therapy(SAT) for non-surgical candidates. Surgical options comprise debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention(DAIR), one-stage/two-stage revision, and salvage procedures. Implementation of standardized infection prevention protocols, rational antibiotic use, surgical technical innovations, and advancements in biomaterials have contributed to a reduction in PJI incidence. However, the spread of bacterial resistance and multidrug-resistant organisms in healthcare settings pose new challenges for PJI prevention and treatment. In the future, the research and development of new antimicrobial materials, the innovation of biofilm control technology and the application of precision medicine are expected to further reduce the incidence of PJI, improve the quality of life of patients, and promote a breakthrough in the field of arthroplasty regarding this issue.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41013706/,10.1186/s13018-025-06257-2
41013468,Effect of preoperative antibiotic use on the implant success rate: a retrospective cohort study of cefixime and ornidazole in China.,"Lou A, Zhu X, Pei H, Zhou J, Li M",2025,BMC oral health,"This study aims to enhance the current clinical understanding of prophylactic antibiotic treatment in China before implant surgeries, and improve the experience and adherence of patients who undergo implant procedures.  METHODS : Patients eligible for inclusion in the past six years were divided into two groups of 500 patients each. Patients in the medication group received one 500 mg cefixime tablet and one 500 mg ornidazole tablet 0.5 hours before implantation. Patients in the non-medicated group did not receive any medicine. Patients were evaluated at two follow-ups: 7-14 days and 3-6 months after implant surgeries. The primary outcome was implant failure, which was characterized as implant detachment or complete loss during follow-ups, implant mobility (clinical mobility >1 mm) detected by surgeons when manually tightening abutments at the second follow-up (3-6 months after surgeries), or complications requiring clinical intervention occurred, including peri-implant bone resorption exceeding acceptable levels. Secondary outcomes were postoperative infection and adverse events. We statistically analyzed study outcomes using the Pearson Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and a multiple logistic regression model to evaluate differences between the two groups. P values less than 0.05 or 95% confidence intervals of relative risk or odds ratio values excluding one were considered statistically significant. We noted implant failures (medication group: four patients, 0.8% and non-medicated group: three patients, 0.6%) and postoperative infections (medication group: 23 patients, 4.6% and non-medicated group: 25 patients, 5.0%) were no statistically significant difference between the two groups. However, adverse events showed a statistically significant increase in the medication group (medication group: 111 patients, 22.2% and non-medicated group: 21 patients, 4.2%), including nausea, vomiting, hypersomnia, dizziness, and diarrhea. There was a statistically non-significant increase in fever in the non-medicated group. No statistically significant evidence existed in preventing postoperative infection between the two groups across smoking status, age, implant system, number of implants (1, 2-3, and ≥4), sinus elevation surgery, implant placement, and guided bone regeneration surgery. Antibiotic prophylaxis using ornidazole in conjunction with cefixime in implant surgery may not have clinical benefits but significantly increases adverse events. Therefore, the necessity of prophylactic antibiotic use in healthy patients before implant surgeries needs to be reconsidered.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41013468/,10.1186/s12903-025-06853-y

This study describes the epidemiology of sepsis in emergency department attendees across England by analysing a unique multi-site linked dataset to inform approaches to strengthen surveillance and improve our understanding of clinical outcomes. An existent study dataset was utilised comprising a sample of paediatric and adult emergency department admissions screened for community-onset sepsis in the Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) program in the 2017/18 financial year linked to Hospital Episode Statistics and Office for National Statistics death registrations. This dataset was linked to the United Kingdom Health Security Agency's Second-Generation Surveillance System for microbiological data. Descriptive analyses were conducted to characterise sepsis screen positives and negatives in CQUIN, including demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, microbiological profiles, and clinical outcomes. Of the 4,027 sepsis-screened emergency admissions included, 2,454 (60.9%) were sepsis screen positive under the CQUIN indicator. Only 11.2% (453/4,027) had a positive blood culture within 2 days of hospital admission. Blood culture positivity rates were 15.2% (373/2,454) and 5.1% (80/1,573) for sepsis screen positive and negative in CQUIN, respectively. Monomicrobial episodes predominated (86.5%), with Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus species being the most commonly isolated bacteria. The study showed a case fatality rate of 17.1% (420/2,454) for sepsis screen positive in CQUIN but revealed no significant difference in all-cause 30-day mortality between sepsis screen positives in CQUIN with and without positive blood cultures. Sepsis screen positives in CQUIN with a focal site of infection code were more likely to have positive blood cultures, except for respiratory infections. This study provides novel insights into the epidemiology of sepsis screening in emergency departments across England, highlighting variability in blood culture positivity rates and microbial profiles. The findings underscore the importance of enhanced surveillance strategies, optimised screening protocols, tailored antimicrobial stewardship practices, and quality improvement initiatives to optimise sepsis management and outcomes. Systemic approaches are needed to address knowledge gaps and inform evidence-based interventions for sepsis care.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41013411/,10.1186/s12879-025-11539-5

This study aims to identify and analyze the key factors influencing antimicrobial use (AMU) and thereby/or the spread of AMR within the poultry production chain, spanning from farm to consumer. A scoping literature review was conducted to investigate factors influencing AMU and/or the emergence and dissemination of AMR in poultry production. Knowledge synthesis was conducted from 69 relevant publications covering data from 41 countries. A total of 327 factors were identified from the various studies. Most factors (221) were related to knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) concerning farms. The other significant group, with 57 factors, involved intentional misuse or poor practices related to antimicrobials. The findings highlight the complexity of factors influencing AMR in poultry production, including financial pressures on farmers and varied training effectiveness.

41012726,Comprehensive Prevention and Control of Mastitis in Dairy Cows: From Etiology to Prevention.,"Yu W, Zhang Z, Wang Z, Lin X, Dong X, Hou Q",2025,Veterinary sciences,"Mastitis, an inflammatory disease caused by the invasion of various pathogenic microorganisms into mammary gland tissue, is a core health issue plaguing the global dairy industry. The consequences of this disease are manifold. In addition to directly compromising the health and welfare of dairy cows, it also precipitates a substantial decline in lactation function, a precipitous drop in raw milk production, and alterations in milk composition (e.g., increased somatic cell counts and imbalanced ratios of milk protein to fat). These changes result in a marked degradation of milk quality and safety, and in turn, engender significant economic losses for the livestock industry. Therefore, the establishment and implementation of a comprehensive prevention and control system is a key strategy to effectively curb the occurrence of mastitis, reduce its incidence rate, and minimise economic losses. This review systematically explores the complex etiological factors and pathogenic mechanisms of mastitis in dairy cows, and summarises various diagnostic methods, including milk apparent indicators monitoring, pathogen detection, physiological parameter monitoring, omics technologies, and emerging technologies. Furthermore, it undertakes an analysis of treatment protocols for mastitis in dairy cows, with a particular emphasis on the significance of rational antibiotic use and alternative therapies. Moreover, it delineates preventive measures encompassing both environmental and hygiene management, and dairy cow health management. The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive and scientific theoretical basis and practical guidance for dairy farming practices. This will help to improve the health of dairy cows, ensure a stable supply of high-quality dairy products, and promote the sustainable and healthy development of the dairy farming industry.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41012726/,10.3390/vetsci12090800 10.3168/jds.2010-4074 10.3390/ani11010131 10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.09.005 10.1016/S0169-409X(01)00160-0 10.3168/jds.2017-13023

Despite the widespread adoption of the laparoscopic approach and advances made in perioperative care, post-operative infections-particularly intra-abdominal abscesses-continue to pose a substantial clinical challenge, with an overall probability that ranges from 5 to 15%. Nowadays, it is essential not only to improve patient outcomes by reducing these complications but also to promote responsible antibiotic use. This review provides an in-depth examination of post-appendectomy infections in adults, synthesizing research from the past decade. It explores the various risks involved, including those related to the patient, the disease itself, and the surgical techniques employed. There is particular emphasis on the impact of surgical approach, closure methods, timing of surgery, and intraoperative decisions such as drain placement, peritoneal lavage, and routine bacterial cultures. Part of the discussion is about emerging data regarding the use of antiseptic solutions and specimen retrieval techniques. Additionally, the review examines current approaches to managing postoperative intra-abdominal abscesses. It assesses when antibiotics are necessary, evaluates image-guided percutaneous drainage, and considers laparoscopic re-intervention as a possible solution. While recent studies offer valuable insights, the heterogeneity of available evidence highlights the pressing need for high-quality, standardized research. Ultimately, a deeper understanding of infection pathways and preventative strategies is vital-not only for reducing morbidity and hospital readmissions, but also for safeguarding the long-term efficacy of antibiotics and delivering safer, more effective surgical care.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41009932/,10.3390/antibiotics14090954 10.1001/jamasurg.2019.6030 10.1007/s00464-014-3809-y 10.1159/000447647 10.1097/SLE.0000000000001234 10.1038/s41598-019-51172-2 10.1186/s13017-020-00306-3 10.1097/JS9.0000000000001938 10.1186/s13017-024-00549-4 10.1089/sur.2019.003 10.1177/1553350617739424 10.1007/s00423-016-1459-3 10.1177/0300060519856154 10.1186/s12893-021-01279-z 10.4174/jkss.2013.84.1.27 10.1002/14651858.cd010168.pub5 10.1177/1457496918783721 10.1007/s00423-020-01913-z 10.1007/s11605-023-05736-3 10.1097/SLE.0000000000000745 10.1186/s13017-021-00391-y 10.1089/lap.2020.0610 10.1093/bjsopen/zrae121 10.1016/j.surg.2019.02.010 10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2015.11.013 10.1186/s13017-021-00387-8 10.1016/j.ijsu.2016.01.069 10.1056/NEJMoa1411162 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2013.07.041 10.1007/s00268-018-4871-8 10.1007/s13304-020-00917-0 10.1038/s41598-020-67591-5 10.4240/wjgs.v16.i3.816 10.1089/sur.2024.112

41009918,Health Literacy and Interventions on Antibiotics Use and AMR in Younger Generations in High-Income Countries-A Systematic Review.,"Molan K, Zore A, Kregar Velikonja N",2025,"Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)","Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing threat to global health, accelerated by the widespread inappropriate use of antibiotics. Although educational initiatives have been launched worldwide, there is little evidence on how younger generations in high-income countries (HICs) understand and address AMR. Addressing the AMR crisis requires proactive education of younger generations, including children, adolescents, and young adults, who will shape future healthcare practices. This review analyzes existing research on AMR literacy among these age groups in HICs, as knowledge gaps and risky behaviors persist even in HICs, despite their strong education and health infrastructures. The purpose of this review is to examine the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance in younger generations while identifying effective educational interventions. We performed a comprehensive literature search in PubMed until June 2025, followed by AI-assisted screening (Claude 4.0 Sonnet) and a manual review. The search strategy combined terms from the areas of health literacy, antibiotics, antibiotic resistance/AMR, and young populations. Studies in HICs that examined the younger generation's knowledge about antibiotics and AMR, analyzed their attitudes or behavior toward them, or evaluated relevant educational interventions were included. Data were synthesized thematically across all included studies. Nineteen studies from 11 HICs were included, including thirteen cross-sectional surveys and six educational intervention studies. The results showed that misconceptions about how antibiotics work are still very common. Several of those asked (22-80%) incorrectly stated that resistance develops in the human body and not in bacteria. Many (26-77%) mistakenly agreed with the statement that antibiotics treat viral infections. Concerning behaviors included high rates of self-medication, non-adherence to treatment, and unsafe storage practices. Several authors propose an amendment of curricula. Educational interventions, particularly gamification and peer education approaches, showed improvements in knowledge and sustained learning outcomes. Knowledge of AMR among young people in HICs is still inadequate, despite educational advantages. Most existing studies focus on college students, while children and adolescents, crucial groups for early prevention, are underrepresented. Targeted, age-appropriate education employing interactive methods represents an evidence-based strategy to improve antibiotic use behavior and support global AMR control efforts.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41009918/,10.3390/antibiotics14090940 10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02724-0 10.1016/S0140-6736(24)01867-1 10.3390/healthcare11131946 10.3390/ijerph19031591 10.1097/PHH.0000000000001324 10.1186/s12889-017-4267-y 10.3389/fpubh.2024.1387874 10.1007/s10389-023-02179-7 10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046453 10.3390/antibiotics11010089 10.1186/s12909-022-03853-2 10.1186/s12889-019-6878-y 10.3855/jidc.10574 10.3389/fpubh.2023.1230848 10.1002/puh2.70034 10.1186/s12982-025-00631-5 10.1371/journal.pone.0182460 10.3855/jidc.12329 10.1016/j.jiph.2017.01.015 10.1371/journal.pone.0264500 10.1080/07448481.2021.1947842 10.1016/j.jiph.2017.02.010 10.3390/antibiotics7010010 10.1016/j.jiac.2020.06.021 10.1186/s13756-023-01251-x 10.1371/journal.pone.0122476 10.3138/jammi-2022-0008 10.1016/j.cptl.2017.12.007 10.3390/antibiotics12101546 10.1371/journal.pone.0240471 10.2196/games.6420 10.1093/jac/dkx083 10.1016/j.infpip.2020.100060 10.1186/s13643-025-02783-6 10.3390/healthcare11233040 10.3389/fpubh.2018.00370 10.3390/ijerph15040687 10.1111/jocn.14073 10.1093/jac/dky150 10.4103/aihb.aihb_92_25 10.3389/fpubh.2024.1462976 10.1186/s12909-025-06856-x 10.1186/s12909-024-06434-7 10.3390/pharmacy9040199 10.1186/s12889-020-08806-2 10.3390/ijerph10072920 10.1093/jac/dkr133 10.3389/fmicb.2022.977319
41009893,Determinants of Implementation of Antimicrobial Stewardship Interventions for Managing Community Adult Acute Respiratory Infections: Qualitative Analysis from the OPTIMAS-GP Study Co-Design Phase.,"Jordan M, Burns M, Cortie C, Radford J, Metusela C, Mullan J, Eckermann S, Williams F, Keighley C, Mazza D, Gajanayake I, Barnett S, Bonney A",2025,"Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)","Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) interventions are critical to reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in primary care and mitigating antimicrobial resistance (AMR). While interventions are routinely employed in hospitals, implementation in general practice is nascent. This qualitative study, part of the OPTIMAS-GP project, explored determinants influencing the implementation of evidence-based AMS strategies in Australian general practice. Using Experience-Based Co-Design, three rounds of online focus groups were conducted with ten healthcare professionals (GPs, pharmacists, microbiologist, practice staff) and ten adult patients who had experienced ARI management in primary care. Participants discussed the feasibility and acceptability of AMS interventions: shared decision-making (SDM) tools, delayed prescribing (DP) and point-of-care testing (PoCT) for C-reactive protein (CRP). Thematic analysis of focus group transcriptions identified four interrelated themes: 'Patient acceptance and engagement', 'Practising within a system', 'Prescribing stewardship', and 'Diagnostic stewardship'. Patient engagement was dependent upon expectations, trust, and personalised care, while systemic factors such as continuity of care, practice culture, and resource availability influenced implementation. DP was viewed as a pragmatic but potentially confusing strategy, requiring clear patient guidance and interprofessional collaboration. SDM tools were conceptually supported but challenged by time constraints and poor health literacy. PoCT-CRP was cautiously welcomed for selective use, with concerns expressed about workflow integration and overreliance on testing. Findings were mapped to the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) and Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to identify behavioural determinants and inform future implementation strategies. Recommendations include co-designing patient-centred AMS tools with clear instructions and red flags, enhancing GP-pharmacist collaboration, and addressing barriers to PoCT integration.

Effective antibiotic stewardship in livestock veterinary practices is essential to combat resistance development and dissemination. This study aimed to explore Portuguese veterinarians' knowledge, perceptions, attitudes, and practices regarding antibiotic prescription and use in livestock, namely bovine, swine, equine, and small ruminants. A qualitative methodology, focus groups (FGs), was conducted by videoconference, between July and December 2024. The FG guide was based on a comprehensive review of relevant literature. Sessions were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analysed using thematic analysis with webQDA software. Results: In total, 19 veterinarians participated in six FG. Three main themes were identified: (i) Antibiotic prescription, use, and management, (ii) Animal welfare management, and (iii) Fostering antibiotic stewardship. Veterinarians recognised the importance of prudent antibiotic use, but faced obstacles, such as farmer non-compliance, insufficient knowledge and/or economic constraints, and limited laboratory resources. National initiatives have increased awareness and surveillance efforts; however, implementation barriers remain, especially given regional farming differences. Findings suggest that addressing AMR requires medium- and long-term, tailored strategies involving policy reforms, enhanced veterinarian and farmer education, improved diagnostic capacity, and effective communication among stakeholders. Emphasising a One Health approach and considering regional contexts are vital to promoting responsible antibiotic use, advancing antibiotic stewardship, and reducing resistance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41004860/,10.1016/j.animal.2025.101648

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy of D-mannose in preventing recurrent UTIs. In May 2024, we systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing D-mannose treatment with no intervention or standard antibiotic therapy in patients at high risk for recurrent UTI. We applied a random-effects model to pool relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We included 6 RCTs comprising 1,167 participants, of whom 534 received D-mannose and 521 (97.6%) were women. D-mannose was not associated with a reduction in recurrent UTI compared with control (RR: 0.57, 95% CI 0.29 - 1.15; p < 0.01) or antibiotics (RR: 0.39, 95% CI 0.12 - 1.25; p < 0.01). Further analyses showed that D-mannose did not improve outcomes in a subgroup of postmenopausal women.

Building on the concept of conditional activity introduced by Lin (2016), we use molecular dynamics simulations and develop an open-source Python library, CONDACT (CONDitional ACTivity), to quantify time-resolved kinetic correlations in nucleosome systems. We analyze long-time simulations of the nucleosome core particle, including two different DNA sequences, the Widom-601 and ASP (alpha-satellite palindromic) sequences. By tracking dihedral angle transitions, we identify residues with high dynamical memory and map inter-residue communication pathways across histone subunits and DNA. Our analysis reveals kinetically connected domains involving post-translational modification sites, oncogenic mutation sites, and DNA contact regions, with dynamic coupling observed over distances up to 7.5 nm. These findings offer new insight into the long-range allosteric behavior of the nucleosome and its potential role in regulating chromatin accessibility. Quantifying this allosteric behavior potentially identifies targetable residues and domains for therapeutic intervention.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41000758/,10.1101/2025.09.14.676121 10.1016/j.jmb.2022.167518 10.1021/acs.jpcb.3c07363 10.1016/s0022-2836(65)80285-6 10.1021/jacs.5b08814 10.1098/rsta.2015.0202 10.1016/j.semcdb.2015.12.007 10.1073/pnas.0810961106 10.1021/jacs.7b05313 10.1073/pnas.122653799 10.7554/elife.73601 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004746 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004620 10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00541 10.3390/ijms21030847 10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00760 10.1021/acs.chemrev.1c00279 10.1016/j.bpj.2015.12.015 10.1021/acs.jcim.4c00059 10.1016/j.bpj.2025.06.011 10.1093/bib/bbad532 10.1063/5.0235544 10.1016/j.bpj.2023.08.010 10.1186/1471-2105-11-330 10.3390/proceedings2019033031 10.1107/s0567740882004075 10.1016/s0092-8674(00)81307-0 10.1016/S0022-2836(02)00386-8 10.1016/j.jmb.2010.08.039 10.1038/38444 10.1016/j.cell.2015.02.001 10.1021/jacs.4c14136 10.1038/nature24046 10.1016/j.str.2008.05.006 10.1016/j.celrep.2015.10.070 10.1534/genetics.117.201939 10.1042/bst20210773 10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01520 10.1073/pnas.1705685114 10.1126/science.aau9904 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b05067 10.1038/s41467-021-22636-9 10.1038/s41586-019-1029-2 10.1371/journal.pone.0268760 10.1038/s41586-018-0029-y 10.1038/s41467-025-57915-2 10.1038/ncomms14860 10.1038/s41586-019-1669-2 10.1016/j.cell.2018.12.014 10.3390/ijms242015194 10.1016/j.pnmrs.2019.01.002 10.1038/s41573-025-01220-6 10.1172/jci183391

Enhancing the pathogen submission rate before antimicrobial therapy is crucial for effective antimicrobial management in healthcare institutions. This study aimed to improve this rate using the FOCUS-PDCA (Find, Orgnize, Clarify, Understand, Select, Plan, Do, Check, Act) model in a tertiary hospital. The present study was conducted from 2021 to 2024, applying the FOCUS-PDCA model. Led by the Hospital Infection Management Department, a multi-disciplinary collaboration team was set up, with indicators and problems as the guide. The interventions included improving information monitoring technology, optimizing specimen collection and delivery processes, strengthening regulatory efforts, and establishing a diversified training system. Data were collected from 56 clinical departments and compared before and after intervention. The pathogen submission rate before antimicrobial therapy was notably increased from 64.99% in 2021 to 76.40% in 2024 ( The FOCUS-PDCA model effectively improved pathogen submission rates and specimen quality, reduced the detection rate of MDRO, and promoted rational antimicrobial use.

41000181,Predicting nosocomial infections in critically Ill children: a comprehensive systematic review of risk assessment models.,"Wang LY, Feng M, Luo YL, Wang CX, Wang H, Li L, Zhang Y, Huang XL, Huang MJ, Tian YM",2025,Frontiers in pediatrics,"Nosocomial infections (NIs) pose a substantial global health challenge, affecting an estimated 7%-10% of hospitalized patients worldwide. Neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) are particularly vulnerable, with NIs representing a leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality. Similarly, pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) report that 28% of admitted children acquire NIs during hospitalization. Although prediction models offer a promising approach to identifying high-risk individuals, a systematic evaluation of existing models for ICU-ill children remains lacking. This review systematically synthesizes and critically evaluates published prediction models for assessing NI risk in ill children in the ICU. We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang from inception through December 31, 2024. Study quality, risk of bias, and applicability were assessed using the PROBAST tool. Model performance metrics were extracted and summarized. Three studies involving 1,632 participants were included. Frequency analysis identified antibiotic use, birth weight, and indwelling catheters as the most consistently incorporated predictors. All models employed traditional logistic regression, with two undergoing external validation. However, critical limitations were observed across studies: inadequate sample sizes, omission of key methodological details, insufficient model specification, and a universally high risk of bias per PROBAST assessment. Current NI prediction models for ill children in the ICU exhibit significant methodological shortcomings, limiting their clinical applicability. No existing model demonstrates sufficient rigor for routine implementation. High-performance predictive models can assist clinical nursing staff in the early identification of high-risk populations for NIs, enabling proactive interventions to reduce infection rates. Future research should prioritize (1) methodological robustness in model development, (2) external validation in diverse settings, and (3) exploration of advanced modeling techniques to optimize predictor selection.

40999450,Nursing-led strategy to combat antimicrobial resistance: multi-method design.,"Pérez-Baena MJ, Torres-Gonçalves A, Holgado-Madruga M",2025,BMC nursing,"Antimicrobial resistance is currently a global health threat. Numerous efforts have been made to prevent or mitigate this phenomenon, but all have been insufficient. Although numerous studies have postulated nursing as a potential mediator to address this problem, no research has been conducted to put it into practice. This study aims to contextualize the problem of inappropriate antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance, as well as to develop and implement a nurse-led educational intervention aimed at mitigating it, emphasizing the role of nurses in health education. Two different groups of participants were recruited using convenience sampling. Nurses administered a survey to 782 citizens in a population from Spain to assess their knowledge of the correct use of antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance. After completing the survey, nurses explained to the participants how to use antibiotics correctly and the problem of antimicrobial resistance. Furthermore, an educational intervention led by nurses was carried out with 104 adolescents, consisting of an oral presentation to raise awareness about the issue. The effectiveness of this intervention was evaluated through a comparative analysis before and after the activity (pre-test and post-test). Our results indicated that the level of knowledge about the correct use of antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance is not statistically significant related to sex in the general population ( These findings highlight the low level of knowledge in the population about the correct use of antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance. It also demonstrates how nurses, through their role in health education, can actively contribute to addressing the issue, providing a rationale for the inclusion of nursing in the design and implementation of strategies to prevent or mitigate antimicrobial resistance.

40996973,"Implementation status and challenges affecting antimicrobial stewardship programmes in private hospitals in Kampala, Uganda: Insights from a cross-sectional descriptive survey.","Kubai D, Adome R, Munanura E, Ashiru-Oredope D, Moriasi G",2025,PLOS global public health,"Private hospitals are critical to healthcare delivery in Kampala, Uganda, where antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes have been introduced as part of the Global Action Plan (GAP) to mitigate the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). However, there is limited empirical data on the extent of AMS implementation and the specific barriers these facilities face in adopting such programmes. We therefore evaluated the implementation status and identified key barriers to AMS uptake in private hospitals across Kampala, Uganda. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 9th January 2024-25th July 2024 in 17 private hospitals, using a mixed-methods approach. Quantitative data were collected using the Commonwealth Partnerships for Antimicrobial Stewardship (CwPAMS) Checklist and analysed descriptively. Qualitative data were gathered through key informant interviews and evaluated using content analysis. The findings revealed significant gaps in AMS implementation. Of the 17 hospitals surveyed, 70.6% (12/17) had not prioritised AMS initiatives in their operations. Besides, 88.2% (15/17) had no budget allocated for AMS activities and 82.4% (14/17) reported insufficient staffing. Additionally, 76.5% (13/17) had not provided AMS-specific training. Furthermore, 64.7% (11/17) lacked regular AMS reports, meeting minutes, or resources for antimicrobial prescribing optimisation, while 41.2% (7/17) had no designated AMS team lead. Besides, qualitative analysis showed structural and institutional challenges, including weak leadership commitment and a lack of sustainable financial planning for AMS programmes. The implementation of AMS programmes in selected private hospitals in Kampala was scanty and constrained by structural, financial, and institutional barriers, including inadequate budget allocation, insufficient staffing, limited training, and the lack of prioritisation of AMS activities. Strengthening institutional support through leadership engagement, funding, and embedding AMS as a core component of hospital policy is essential. Additionally, a multi-stakeholder approach is crucial to driving sustainable AMS adoption, aligning with global AMR mitigation efforts, and ensuring optimal patient outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40996973/,10.1371/journal.pgph.0004333 10.1016/bs.abr.2022.08.001 10.1016/S0140-6736(24)01867-1 10.3390/ejihpe11010006 10.1016/j.nmni.2015.02.007 10.1136/bmjgh-2020-003393 10.1186/s12879-016-1810-x 10.1016/j.jgar.2021.08.001 10.2147/IDR.S234610 10.1128/CMR.18.4.638-656.2005 10.1017/ice.2019.294 10.3390/antibiotics13030253 10.1016/j.lanwpc.2020.100084 10.1016/j.jgar.2019.09.020 10.1128/microbe.10.354.1 10.1016/j.jgar.2020.03.009 10.4103/injms.injms_118_19 10.1016/j.ijid.2021.03.035 10.3389/fpubh.2020.00454 10.1016/S2214-109X(23)00019-0 10.3390/pharmacy8020107 10.1136/bmjopen-2019-030823 10.3390/antibiotics9110764 10.1371/journal.pone.0262993 10.1016/j.chest.2020.03.012 10.18099/ijetv.v8i02.06 10.1016/j.cmi.2018.03.033 10.1186/s13756-021-00929-4 10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00070-7 10.1136/bmj-2022-072319 10.1016/j.cmi.2018.08.020 10.3390/healthcare12212122 10.1016/S2214-109X(23)00019-0 10.1093/jacamr/dlac094 10.3389/fpubh.2020.493904 10.1016/j.ajic.2021.01.020 10.3390/antibiotics13030197 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.2007 10.7196/SAMJ.2018.v108i7.13149 10.1017/ash.2022.355 10.1017/ice.2021.480 10.7196/SAMJ.2017.v107i2.12067 10.1080/17441692.2021.2003839 10.1007/s40506-020-00241-6 10.1007/s10123-022-00278-1 10.1093/jacamr/dlz066 10.1186/s12913-017-2656-7 10.1371/journal.pgph.0003314 10.1093/jac/dkv159 10.1002/j.2055-2335.2011.tb00064.x 10.1186/s12875-023-02223-1 10.1016/S0140-6736(24)01019-5 10.1038/s43856-024-00594-9 10.1097/MJT.0000000000000282 10.1001/jama.2016.0275 10.1093/jac/dky321 10.1093/cid/ciab773 10.1111/tct.12756 10.3390/ANTIBIOTICS11091149/S1

Also, to assess whether these curricula meet WHO recommendations and identify any gaps compared with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) antimicrobial prescribing and stewardship competency framework. A search for online education resources was carried out to identify UG curricula or CFs for HCPs for AMS or antimicrobial resistance applicable to the UK. Seven curricula or CFs were identified and reviewed. One AMS CF for all UG health workers, three for pharmacy UG students, one nursing AMS CF, one medical AMS CF, and the pathology curriculum. Domains varied between them but significant overlap was identified, and the majority of knowledge objectives in the WHO modules were covered in all UG curricula/CFs (except those objectives listed under the role of laboratory staff, which were only in the pathology curriculum). Gaps were identified between the most recently published UG curricula for pharmacists and the UKHSA antimicrobial prescribing and stewardship CF.

The programme included online and live courses covering relevant AMS learning goals. Participants also carried out a local AMS project using a determinant analysis with pre- and post-intervention measurements. Data were collected through surveys, exams, and an evaluation of mandatory reports to assess progress across Kirkpatrick's four levels of learning: reaction, learning, behaviour and results. Forty participants from 22 countries took part in the programme. Individual courses were positively evaluated (reaction, level 1). All participants passed the final exam (learning, level 2).

""One-size-fits-all"" campaigns have demonstrated little impact in increasing public knowledge of antibiotic use and AMR. Whilst healthcare providers are the most trusted sources of health information, only half of the adult population have a healthcare encounter annually. Their limited reach suggests inadequacies in communication channels and a need for mobilization of community-based non-healthcare influencers to increase accessibility to information on antibiotic use and AMR. Whilst the engagement of community barbershops and hair salons as health advocates has been well studied and shown to be effective for health education, there is no study to date harnessing ubiquitous neighborhood food establishments for health education and none assessing the comparative effectiveness of various types of neighborhood establishments as health advocates. This study protocol describes research which aims to compare the effectiveness of health education facilitated by neighborhood food and beauty establishments, versus neighborhood clinics, in increasing the public's knowledge of antibiotic use and AMR, and improving antibiotic behaviors. A quasi-experimental study will be conducted in highly frequented healthcare clinics, and beauty and food establishments in two neighborhoods in Central Singapore. Clients (patients/patrons) aged ≥ 21 years visiting the chosen establishments will be invited to participate in the one-year-long study by scanning the QR code on recruitment posters placed within the establishment premises. Participants will receive educational information on antibiotic use and AMR via a two-minute animated video, developed based on the knowledge needs and media preferences of the community. Outcome measures, namely participants' knowledge of antibiotic use and AMR, and antibiotic use practices will be assessed via self-administered surveys conducted at five longitudinal time-points: pre-intervention, immediate post-intervention, 1-month post-intervention, 3-month post-intervention, and 6-month post-intervention. Additionally, the reach and implementation fidelity of the intervention at the participating study sites will be assessed. Findings from the study will enable a more comprehensive understanding of the potential reach and effects of health education facilitated by neighborhood retail establishments in relation to neighborhood healthcare clinics, enabling better insights into selecting health message outreach options.

Articles' publication year ranged from 2004 to 2023, with most (n = 55) using a quantitative approach, and the remaining ones (n = 4) using mixed methods. Veterinary practices were categorized into four groups: livestock (n = 24), small animals (n = 14), equine (n = 5), and mixed practice (broader scope; n = 17). Intrinsic factors identified as potentially influencing veterinarians' antibiotic prescription included: socio-demographic factors (n = 39) and attitudes and concerns: self-confidence (n = 31); need to satisfy clients' expectations (n = 19); fear (n = 27); lack of knowledge (n = 21). Extrinsic factors were also identified in several studies: clients' lack of knowledge and/or training regarding AMR, appropriate antimicrobial use, and good production practices (n = 24); substandard hygiene conditions and biosecurity protocols (n = 14); time constraints (n = 4); cost of laboratory tests (n = 12); antibiotic policies and/or guidelines (n = 22); antibiotics cost (n = 20), and withdrawal period (n = 11); animal-related factors (n = 21), namely breeding and animals' behavior. This systematic review provides an updated and comprehensive understanding of non-clinical factors that can influence veterinarians' antibiotic prescription practices. High client demand, self-confidence, need to satisfy clients' expectations, deficient biosecurity, fear, lack of awareness from animal owners and farmers about AMR and appropriate antimicrobial use, and inadequate policies/guidelines were associated with higher antibiotic prescription among veterinarians. Many of the identified factors are potentially modifiable. Within the One Health approach, this can help in the design of interventions focusing on appropriate antibiotic use in animals to tackle AMR.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40993662/,10.1186/s12917-025-05001-6
40993594,"Analysis of antibiotic use, biosecurity and mortality in semi-intensive broiler farms in Kenya.","Kemunto NP, Muloi DM, Ibayi EL, Njaramba JK, Hoffmann V, Murphy M, Nielsen SS, Moodley A",2025,BMC veterinary research,"The indiscriminate use of antibiotics in food-producing animals contributes to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), posing a global threat. Understanding the factors associated with antibiotic use is critical to combat resistance while maintaining animal health. This study examined antibiotic use practices, mortality rates, biosecurity levels, as well as the associations between biosecurity and antibiotic use, and between biosecurity and mortality, in semi-intensive broiler farms in Kenya.The study was conducted in 129 semi-intensive farms with total flock sizes between 200 and 2000 birds across three peri-urban counties in Kenya. Data were collected prospectively over one production cycle, with farms visited biweekly using questionnaires and a drug bin approach. Biosecurity levels were assessed by a panel of experts who weighted scores for various external and internal biosecurity subcategories. Directed acyclic graphs (DAG) described potential relationships between explanatory variables, confounders and outcome. Logistic regression analysis was conducted with antibiotic use as the outcome variable. Explanatory variables with P < 0.25 in the univariable logistic regression were included in the multivariable regression. Similarly, linear regression was conducted using mortality as the outcome.Overall, 72% of farms used antibiotics, primarily for prophylaxis (66%), with erythromycin and oxytetracycline being the most commonly used antibiotics. The median mortality rate across the production cycle was 6%. There was no significant difference in mortality between farms using antibiotics and those not using antibiotics. Biosecurity practices were low, with a median biosecurity score of 14.3/67.9. Univariable screening suggested potential associations between antibiotic use and vaccination of day-old chicks, flock size, cleaning protocol for chicken drinkers, resting period between batches, feed store cleaning, water source, distance from neighbouring farms, and age. However, these were not significant in multivariable logistic regression. Linear regression showed an association between mortality and biosecurity measures, specifically disease management and visitor entry regulation.This study highlights widespread antibiotic use, low biosecurity implementation, and variability in mortality rates in the farms surveyed. There is a gap in farmers' implementation of effective biosecurity measures and understanding of prudent antibiotic use. An urgent need exists to develop comprehensive data collection methodologies, education, and interventions to promote responsible antibiotic stewardship and cost-effective biosecurity practices among poultry farmers in Kenya.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40993594/,10.1186/s12917-025-04948-w

Despite its significance, only a few studies have delved into parental perspectives. Therefore, this study used a questionnaire-based survey and a module-based learning intervention to assess Indonesian parental knowledge, attitude, and practice related to antibiotic use in pediatric care. A total of 257 parents of children aged 0-11 attending postnatal healthcare centers in Arcamanik District, Bandung, Indonesia, participated in this study using a validated questionnaire. Additionally, we developed and implemented an education module using an on-site learning approach to assist a total of 57 parents who previously participated in the questionnaire-based study and agreed to participate in managing their children's use of antibiotics. We also conducted pre- and post-tests to evaluate the improvement in knowledge. The results showed that based on the questionnaire-based survey, about half of parents believed antibiotics were necessary for children's illness (50%), and 64.5% considered their use essential when other treatments failed. Based on their previous symptoms, approximately 17.7% of parents misused antibiotics as stand-alone treatments. A significant 94.5% expressed the need for comprehensive information from healthcare providers regarding prudent use. The significant mean difference (45.79 ± 12.33; P = 0.00) between pre- and post-test analyses showed improvement in parental knowledge following the intervention. This study underscored a concerning lack of understanding among parents, leading to self-medication practices in Indonesia. Using the developed module, the educational intervention effectively increased parental awareness. This suggested the potential for tailored interventions to rectify misconceptions and promote responsible antibiotic use in pediatric care.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40993564/,10.1186/s12887-025-06084-8

Prophylactic antibiotics often control POIC risk; however, there is no clear consensus on their use in HALDN. Considering the incidence of POICs, National Health Service (NHS) resource constraints, and antimicrobial stewardship priorities, a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was conducted to evaluate the economic impact of prophylactic antibiotic use in HALDN. A CEA was conducted using data from the UK multicenter, double-blinded, randomized controlled POWAR (Prophylaxis of Wound Infections-antibiotics in Renal Donation) trial. The primary outcome was the cost per POIC avoided within 30 days post-HALDN. Effectiveness was defined as the absence of POICs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated in British pounds. Four sensitivity analyses examined variability in drug costs, length of stay, POIC severity, and cost thresholds. The ICER for antibiotic prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis was -£4,709.71, indicating that prophylaxis was cost-saving. Sensitivity analyses under all 4 scenarios confirmed the robustness of this cost-saving finding under varying assumptions. Antibiotic prophylaxis in HALDN is a cost-saving intervention. These findings support the need to review UK guidelines for antibiotic use in living donor renal transplant surgery, specifically regarding prophylactic measures for donors. Further clarification on whether HALDN should be classified as a 'clean' or 'clean-contaminated' procedure may enhance consistency in national practice and inform evidence-based antibiotic stewardship and policy aligned with NHS goals for safe and sustainable surgical care.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40989871/,10.1097/AS9.0000000000000592

A cross-sectional survey was carried out in November 2024 across four hospitals in the South West Region of Cameroon: Limbe Regional Hospital, Buea Regional Hospital Annex, Baptist Hospital Mutengene, and Kumba Baptist Health Center. For data collection, we used the standard WHO checklist to assess AMS activities at the healthcare facilities designed for low- and middle-income countries. Key informant interview involving the AMS focal persons of various hospitals enabled data collection. Limbe Regional Hospital has the highest full implementation rate of AMS activities (67%), while Buea regional hospital is the least of fully implemented activities (19%). An average of 49% of all AMS activities are fully implemented across the healthcare facilities, partially implemented activities made up 28%, only 3% of the activities are in the planning phase but not yet started. A 13% of the activities are not implemented across the studied facilities, while 7% of the activities are not implemented but identified as a priority. Although the rate is still low, there is good progress in implementation of AMS activities with most activities either fully or partially implemented; however, no health facility included AMS activities in their annual plans with key performance indicators, no management of any hospital allocated financial and human resources to initiate AMS activities.

Narrative review. This review is based on existing literature regarding CDSS in AMS across various healthcare environments, such as hospitals and primary care facilities. The systems evaluated include both stand-alone tools and those integrated into electronic health records (EHR), featuring expert rule-based logic and new machine learning (ML) models. CDSS capabilities include prescribing guidance, alerts, resistance prediction, and de-escalation protocols. CDSS are intended to aid in antimicrobial prescribing by integrating clinical guidelines with data specific to each patient. Despite their theoretical potential, their effectiveness is often hindered by inconsistent incorporation into clinical practices, low user engagement, and inadequate design. Many systems are reactive, not well-suited to user needs, or lack transparency in their recommendations. Evaluating these systems is challenging due to varied outcomes, poor methodological quality of studies, and the complexity of attributing causality in intricate care settings. Barriers to implementation include alert fatigue, perceived time constraints, poor fit with existing workflows, and resistance to change. Instances like the COMPASS trial demonstrate the disconnect between design and practical application, underscoring the necessity for user-focused development, clear reasoning, and a balanced approach between mandatory and advisory elements. CDSS have the potential to improve antimicrobial use, but widespread impact is hindered by evaluation and implementation challenges. Realizing their value requires better integration, usability, and rigorous research frameworks tailored to complex healthcare settings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40989663/,10.1017/ash.2025.10091

The precise prediction of bacterial antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and phenotypes is essential to understand resistance mechanisms and guide clinical antibiotic use. Although high-throughput DNA sequencing provides a foundation for identification, current methods lack precision and often require manual intervention. We developed a novel deep learning model for ARG prediction by integrating bacterial protein sequences using two protein language models, ProtBert-BFD and ESM-1b. The model further employs data augmentation techniques and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to enhance feature extraction and classification performance. The proposed model demonstrated superior performance compared to existing methods, achieving higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. It significantly reduced both false negative and false positive predictions in identifying ARGs, providing a robust computational tool for reliable gene-level resistance detection. Moreover, the model was successfully applied to predict bacterial resistance phenotypes, demonstrating its potential for clinical applicability.

Many medical students feel that they do not receive sufficient training in this respect during their undergraduate medical education. In recent years, digital learning formats are being successfully employed in student teaching. Our aim was to develop and evaluate a massive open online course (MOOC) on appropriate antibiotic therapy and the development of AMR. The intention was to provide the MOOC as an effective learning format in medical schools and to encourage others to develop their own MOOCs on other topics. We developed a MOOC for medical students that consisted of four modules (M1-4) on bacteriology, microbiology diagnostics, pharmacology, antibiotics, AMR, the One Health approach, principles of appropriate antibiotic therapy, and transfer of knowledge to clinical practice. MOOC learners were asked to answer the same 16 knowledge and five self-assessment questions at the beginning and end of the MOOC and to give course feedback in an anonymous online questionnaire. From July 1, 2021 until June 30, 2022 the MOOC was actively attended by 2061 learners. Of them, 473 (23%) completed the final exam and 389 (19%) answered the knowledge and self-assessment questions at the beginning and end of the MOOC. A significant increase in knowledge and a strengthening of competence and self-confidence was observed in these 389 learners. The median knowledge score increased significantly from 10/16 (IQR 8; 12) points before the MOOC to 16/16 (15; 16) afterwards (p < 0.001). Overall, course activity decreased from M1 (100% attendance) to M4 (38%). At the end of the MOOC, the online feedback questionnaire was completed by 304 (15%) learners, most of whom rated the MOOC positively. For example, 97% of them stated that they had increased their knowledge in relevant areas. A high dropout rate for voluntary MOOCs is generally reported. Therefore, a course completion rate of 23% is acceptable. The learners who completed the MOOC showed a significant increase in knowledge and self-confidence.

40982761,Use of Oral Antibiotics for Diabetic Foot Osteomyelitis: A Systematic Review.,"Sood S, Geng R, Waked J, Mufti A, Sriranganathan A, Sibbald RG",2025,Advances in skin & wound care,"The optimal treatment modality for diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) remains unclear. The current guidelines from Diabetes Canada recommend the use of oral antibiotics and/or intravenous antibiotics with no preferred agent or route of administration. This report aimed to evaluate the current evidence surrounding oral antibiotic therapy for DFO. Embase and MEDLINE databases were searched for original articles written in English that reported efficacy and safety data on oral antibiotic use for this indication. Twenty-six unique studies were included, encompassing 972 patients treated with oral antibiotics. The mean age was 64.6 years (range: 30 to 90 y). When used as monotherapy, the complete resolution and partial resolution rate for oral antibiotic therapy were 75.2% (539/717) and 3.2% (23/717), respectively. When used as a step-down therapy after intravenous antibiotics, the complete and partial resolution rate for oral antibiotics were 56.5% (155/255) and 20.4% (52/255), respectively. No resolution of DFO resulting in refractory infection or amputation was observed in 155 (21.6%) cases of oral antibiotics monotherapy and 59 (23.1%) of step-down therapy. Recurrence rates for oral antibiotics monotherapy and step-down therapy were 5.4% (39/717) and 3.9% (10/255), respectively. Oral antibiotic therapy demonstrates favorable outcomes in DFO comparable to intravenous treatment. Oral antibiotic therapy may be especially useful in low-resource settings where hospital beds are limited and in situations where patients require ambulation. Nonetheless, patients should be counselled on the vital importance of adherence, and resource stewardship should be practiced by health care providers to avoid antibiotic resistance. To present a systematic review article evaluating the utility of oral antibiotics for the treatment of diabetic foot osteomyelitis. This continuing education activity is intended for physicians; physician assistants; nurse practitioners; podiatrists/other foot specialists; and nurses with an interest in skin, wound, and diabetic foot care. After completing this continuing education activity, the participant should be better able to:Summarize the evidence the authors considered when evaluating the utility of oral antibiotics for diabetic foot osteomyelitis.Select the characteristics of the participants and settings in which oral antibiotic therapy was utilized.Identify the results of the authors' study assessing the use of oral antibiotics.Discuss﻿ potential situations in which oral antibiotic therapy may provide favorable outcomes as monotherapy or in conjunction with intravenous antibiotics for diabetic foot osteomyelitis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40982761/,10.1097/ASW.0000000000000343

Most Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) strategies rely on private-room isolation, but evidence of their effectiveness in resource-limited settings is scarce. From February-October 2021, we conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial in six general medical wards at Siriraj Hospital, enrolling adults with ≥1 CRE risk factor. Wards were randomized to standard IPC (sIC) or an enhanced CRE prevention program (eIC) comprising sIC plus monthly staff education, real-time notifications of CRE acquisition, and contact-precaution reminders. Active stool/rectal CRE surveillance was performed at enrollment and weekly. Primary outcomes were the CRE acquisition incidence and CRE acquisition-free time. A total of 363 patients were included: 174 in the intervention group (1,684 patient-days) and 189 in the control group (1,517 patient-days). The cumulative incidence of CRE acquisition was slightly lower in the intervention group (36.8% vs. 46.6%; p=0.06), with a significantly lower incidence rate per patient-day (0.038 vs. 0.058;p=0.007). In a post-hoc analysis excluding acquisitions within 24 hours, the cumulative incidence was similar between groups (25.7% vs. 33.6%; p=0.16). The probability of remaining CRE-free showed an unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.72 [95%CI:0.52-1.00;p=0.05]. After adjusting for prior antibiotic use, the adjusted HR was 0.75 [95%CI:0.54-1.05;p=0.09]. There were no differences in all-cause mortality or length of hospital stay. CRE acquisition incidence was high in this setting. The enhanced CRE prevention program tended to reduce CRE acquisition and prolong CRE-free survival. Larger studies are needed to explore benefits on morbidity and mortality.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40982552/,10.1093/cid/ciaf523

The purpose of this study was to determine the knowledge and confidence of pharmacy students in their final professional year regarding beta-lactam (BL) allergies. Students from 5 schools of pharmacy participated in a 22-question survey pertaining to experience with drug allergies, knowledge of BL allergies, and confidence regarding BL allergy management. Data were summarized among all respondents and further analyzed by infectious disease (ID) interest. A total of 160/521 students responded to the survey (31%). Most students (73%) had no course dedicated to drug allergies; however, 84% indicated the topic was taught within the curriculum. Students with an ID interest had a higher perceived knowledge regarding the details of penicillin skin testing (62% vs. 32%), clinical implications of penicillin skin test results (87% vs. 70%), and the principles behind a graded and direct penicillin challenge (64% vs. 41%). These students were more confident in educating patients about a perceived penicillin allergy (34% vs. 15%).

In January 2024, a comprehensive search was conducted in Medline, Embase, Web of Science and CINAHL to identify relevant studies on HCPs' KAP in infection management and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). After deduplication, initial screening was done using Rayyan, with 10% checked for accuracy. Two reviewers independently assessed full texts, and data extraction was verified by another reviewer. Quality assessment was conducted by one reviewer, with 20% of studies double-checked. Studies published from 2016 onwards, focusing on the UK and comparable settings, were included. A narrative synthesis was performed due to heterogeneity between studies. Of 10 990 records, 113 studies were included. KAP measures varied, complicating direct comparisons. Some studies assessed objective knowledge while most measured perceived knowledge, revealling discrepancies between the two. While most participants acknowledged the harms of inappropriate antimicrobial use, willingness to engage in antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) varied by profession. Practice behaviour assessment indicated varying hand-hygiene compliance and AMS implementation, along with significant concerns about inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. The review highlights significant gaps in HCPs' KAP regarding infection prevention and AMS, with variations across professions. This underscores the need for targeted interventions. Additionally, standardized KAP assessment measures are essential to enhance comparability across different contexts.

40980189,The role of the community pharmacist in antibiotic use - a commentary on current status and future perspectives.,"Lambert M, van Dijk L, Benko R, Llor C, Lykkegaard J, Mantel-Teeuwisse AK, Pont L, Taxis K",2025,Exploratory research in clinical and social pharmacy,"Most antibiotics are prescribed, dispensed, and consumed in the community setting. Community pharmacists have a great potential to optimise antibiotic use and mitigate antibiotic resistance in this setting through antibiotic stewardship. This commentary aims to highlight critical areas where community pharmacists can contribute to optimising antibiotic use and to offer suggestions for how this can be implemented in practice. Currently, the role of the community pharmacist is mostly limited to dispensing of antibiotics and treatment of minor infectious ailments. This role needs to evolve to optimise antibiotic use and mitigate resistance development. Following the Social Care Framework for applying person-centred healthcare, there are five strategies through which the role of the community pharmacist can evolve: awareness, adjustment, assistance, alignment, and advocacy. Concretely, this could include many different activities such as better informing and counselling patients, optimising antibiotic treatment duration and choice, exact quantity dispensing, performing point-of-care tests, pharmacist prescribing of antibiotics, and joining academic detailing and public health campaigns. To achieve this, education, policy, and research need to be further aligned. In many countries, pharmacy education on antimicrobial stewardship needs a stronger basis in universities, followed by early career specialisation and continuous professional development.

Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are critical in addressing this challenge by promoting appropriate antibiotic use and reducing resistance. This scoping review synthesizes evidence published between 2018 and 2025, examining the challenges, opportunities, and strategies for implementing ASPs in Nigeria. Key challenges include inadequate diagnostic capacity, poor regulatory enforcement, and limited resources. Opportunities exist in leveraging technology, fostering international partnerships, and adopting the One Health approach. Proposed strategies include expanding diagnostic stewardship, increasing investment in laboratory infrastructure, enforcing antibiotic prescribing policies, integrating antimicrobial resistance (AMR) content into healthcare curricula, and launching targeted public awareness campaigns. Data visualization through figures and tables highlights resistance trends across common pathogens, conceptual ASP frameworks, implementation challenges, and the systematic review flowchart of study selection.

A cross-sectional survey was conducted between October and November 2024. A multistage stratified cluster random sampling method and a self-administered questionnaire were used to collect demographic and sociological characteristics, knowledge, and behaviors regarding antibiotic use from 2,575 parents in eastern China. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the factors influencing the inappropriate use of antibiotics. Among the 2,575 participants, 49.05% reported self-storage of antibiotics (SSA) for their children, 21.90% reported self-medication with antibiotics (SMA), 57.13% reported non-adherence to antibiotic treatment (NAAT), and 8.04% reported using antibiotics for disease prevention in their children in the past year. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that parents scored less than 5 were more likely to report NAAT (adjusted OR [aOR] = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.15-1.83) and use antibiotics for disease prevention (aOR = 5.62, 95% CI = 3.26-9.69) in their children and less likely to report SSA (aOR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.54-0.86).

On 6 June 2024, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added the intervention to its clinical guidelines. However, expanding antibiotic use carries the risk of propagating antimicrobial resistance among target STIs and non-target pathogens, prompting some experts to advocate withholding doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis until further research is done. Thus, the use of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis is a question of whether the risk of antimicrobial resistance to the population is justified by the health benefits to gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men.

However, lung ultrasound (LUS) is increasingly emerging as a transformative tool in both diagnosis and management. Evidence from recent meta-analyses reveals that LUS outperforms CXR in sensitivity and rivals it in specificity, with pooled diagnostic accuracies exceeding 90 %. Unlike CXR, LUS is radiation-free, cost-effective, and ideal for bedside use, making it particularly valuable in emergency departments, intensive care units, pediatric and geriatric populations, and resource-limited settings. In children, LUS spares radiation exposure, while in elderly patients, contrast-enhanced ultrasound improves diagnostic specificity. Beyond diagnosis, LUS enables dynamic monitoring, prognostic scoring (e.g., LUS score, CPIS-PLUS), and supports treatment decisions such as ventilator weaning and antibiotic stewardship. Recent applications during the COVID-19 pandemic have demonstrated its effectiveness in triage and outcome prediction. Despite challenges such as operator dependency and reduced penetration for deep lesions, technological advances-particularly artificial intelligence and handheld devices-are mitigating these limitations. Deep learning models now interpret LUS images with high accuracy, enhancing reproducibility and accessibility for general practitioners. In low- and middle-income countries, LUS serves as a crucial diagnostic bridge, improving access and reducing reliance on costly imaging modalities. As training programs and standardized scoring systems evolve, LUS is becoming a frontline tool rather than a supplementary option. Its integration into clinical practice promises to reshape pneumonia care through rapid, accurate, and scalable diagnostics. In light of these advancements, LUS is not just complementary to radiography-it is redefining the diagnostic landscape of pneumonia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40976013/,10.1016/j.resmer.2025.101203

Infectious diseases,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping infectious disease diagnostics by supporting clinical decision making, optimising laboratory and clinical workflows, and enabling real-time disease surveillance. AI approaches improve pathogen detection, antimicrobial stewardship, and treatment monitoring, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. The role of AI in combating antimicrobial resistance is particularly significant, enabling rapid pathogen identification and personalised treatment. Despite progress over the past two decades, widespread AI adoption in infectious disease diagnostics faces challenges. In high-income countries, fragmented data ecosystems, incomplete datasets, and algorithmic bias hinder clinical integration. Meanwhile, low-income and middle-income countries contend with limited digital infrastructure, unstandardised data, and financial constraints, exacerbating disparities in diagnostic access. Further barriers include concerns over interoperability, data privacy, cybersecurity, and the regulation of AI implementation. This paper examines the role of AI in infectious disease diagnostics, highlighting both opportunities and limitations. It underscores the need for coordinated investments in digital infrastructure, harmonised data-sharing frameworks, and clinician engagement to support equitable, sustainable adoption. Addressing these challenges will enable health-care systems to harness the potential of AI to improve infectious disease detection, prevention, and management of infectious diseases, thereby strengthening global health resilience.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40972627/,10.1016/S1473-3099(25)00354-8

Despite advancements in burn care, infections remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Early and accurate detection of bacterial burden is critical for effective intervention, yet traditional diagnostic methods have limitations. Fluorescence imaging has emerged as an effective tool to enhance bacterial detection and guide infection management in burn wound management. This scoping review summarizes current evidence on fluorescence imaging-guided detection of bacterial loads in burn wounds and explores its potential role across different stages of burn care. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed using the inclusion and exclusion terms (""fluorescence"" OR ""autofluorescence"") AND (""burn"" OR ""burns"") AND ""imaging"" AND ""bacteria"" NOT ""microscopy"". This search yielded 30 publications, which were further filtered to exclude pre-clinical studies, review articles, or articles that were not specific to burns. A total of 6 articles investigating the diagnostic accuracy of fluorescence imaging (MolecuLight) in burn patients were identified. This evidence suggests that fluorescence imaging improves the accuracy of bacterial detection in burns compared to clinical assessment alone, facilitating targeted wound sampling and debridement, enhancing antimicrobial stewardship, and guiding timely interventions. Additionally, burn wound surgical planning may be optimized by fluorescence imaging-guided identification of areas requiring excision and grafting. Fluorescence imaging shows promise in enhancing bacterial detection in burn wounds, aiding clinical decision-making and infection management.

Data on patient factors (sex, age, disease, treatment, outcome) and tooth-related aspects (procedure, diagnosis, anesthesia, irrigation, obturation, antibiotics) were extracted. Of the 514 studies identified, 15 articles (133 patients) met inclusion criteria. One prospective study included 65 patients and 96 RCTs; the remaining patients were reported in case reports or series and in two retrospective studies. Endodontic protocols varied largely across studies. The most common indications for RCT were pulpitis (n = 62) and periapical lesions with acute endodontic diseases (n = 119). All patients were undergoing antiresorptive therapy with oral or intravenous bisphosphonates for the management of osteoporosis or oncologic conditions. RCT was performed in all cases using conventional protocols that included local anesthesia (in some cases without vasoconstrictors), mechanical instrumentation, chemical irrigation (most commonly with sodium hypochlorite) and root canal obturation. Five studies reported antibiotic use. The cases of MRONJ (n = 7, 5.3%; mean treatment duration was 49 months) appeared only in oncological patients. RCT appears to be a safe procedure for patients receiving bisphosphonates. Cases in which RCT appeared to act as a trigger for MRONJ are rare and ambiguous and seem primarily associated with procedural errors or high-risk patients. Although some recommendations for endodontic practice to prevent MRONJ have been proposed, there is a clear need for further research in this area.

Over 90% of prescriptions in France are issued in primary care, mainly by general practitioners. This study analyzes how RUA is integrated into the activities of Professional and Territorial Health Communities (CPTS; Communautés professionnelles territoriales de santé) based on a survey of health care professionals in two CPTS from three French regions chosen for their engagement in national initiatives on antibiotic resistance. A total of 488 health care professionals were selected, with a participation rate of 32,4%. The results show uneven awareness of RUA and the ""One Health"" concept among professionals. While antibiotic resistance is perceived as a major issue, its integration into the CPTS's objectives remains limited. The study highlights the need to improve interprofessional coordination and ongoing training to optimize RUA, adapting strategies to each profession's specific needs and strengthening collaboration with regional centers for antibiotic stewardship (CRAtb). Integrating antibiotic resistance into CPTS missions appears to be a key strategy for effectively addressing this public health issue at the local level. L’exercice coordonné favorise une approche globale, intégrant la prévention des infections et l’usage rationnel des antibiotiques (BUA), crucial face à l’enjeu de l’antibiorésistance. Plus de 90 % des prescriptions sont réalisées en médecine de ville, principalement par des médecins généralistes. But de l’étude : Cette étude analyse l’intégration du BUA dans les activités des Communautés Professionnelles Territoriales de Santé (CPTS), à travers une enquête auprès des professionnels de santé de trois CPTS dans deux régions françaises sélectionnées pour leur degré d’implication dans les missions nationales sur l’antibiorésistance. 488 professionnels de santé ont été sélectionnés avec un taux de participation de 32,4 %. Résultats : Les résultats montrent une sensibilisation inégale au BUA et au concept “Une seule santé” parmi les professionnels. Si l’antibiorésistance est perçue comme un enjeu majeur, son intégration dans les objectifs des CPTS demeure limitée. L’étude souligne la nécessité d’améliorer la coordination interprofessionnelle et la formation continue pour optimiser le BUA, tout en adaptant les stratégies aux besoins spécifiques de chaque profession et en renforçant la collaboration avec les Centres Régionaux en Antibiothérapie (CRAtb). L’intégration de l’antibiorésistance dans les missions des CPTS apparaît comme une stratégie clé pour répondre efficacement à cet enjeu de santé publique sur les territoires.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40968040/,10.3917/spub.hs1.2025.0167

We analyzed antimicrobial use before and after implementing a narrow-spectra ECMO antimicrobial prophylaxis protocol intended to standardize prophylaxis by risk related to ECMO type and configuration. This retrospective, single-center study included children under 18 years old requiring ECMO between May 2018 and December 2021. Medical and cardiac surgical patients requiring open-chested (central) or peripheral veno-venous or veno-arterial ECMO were included. We evaluated the impact of an ECMO antimicrobial prophylaxis protocol by comparing the appropriateness of antimicrobial use as well as nosocomial infections in the pre versus post protocol. Our study included 55 children with 58 individual ECMO episodes. More than 50% of the patients were open-chested during ECMO support, and the majority of ECMO support was veno-arterial. In the post protocol period, patients were 4 times as likely to have appropriate antimicrobial prescribing (Odds ratio 4.4; 95% confidence interval: 1.1-19; P = 0.036), including both prophylactic (per protocol) and therapeutic (chart documentation of an infection with appropriate therapeutic antimicrobials, including drug and duration). There was no difference in the odds of nosocomial infection occurring during ECMO pre protocol versus post protocol (pre vs. post protocol, P = 0.71 for invasive infections, P = 0.73 for all infections including potential colonization).

In Mexico, no published data are available on antibacterial consumption in children. The aim of this study was to evaluate antibacterial consumption levels and trends before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic in a tertiary care pediatric hospital in Mexico, and to forecast future antibacterial consumption. This was a secondary analysis based on time series data of monthly antibacterial consumption from January 2016 to June 2024 in a tertiary care pediatric hospital. Antibacterial consumption was retrospectively measured for the pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic periods. Consumption was expressed as days of therapy (DOT) per 1000 patient-days (pd). The mean antibacterial consumption at the Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez (HIMFG) from 2016 to 2024 was 789.3 (95% CI, 756.1-822.5) DOT/1000 pd. In the medical pediatric intensive care unit (M-PICU) and surgical pediatric intensive care unit (S-PICU), mean consumption was 1305.3 DOT/1000 pd (95% CI: 1119.1-1491.6) and 1634.5 DOT/1000 pd (95% CI: 1444.2-1824.9), respectively.

Overall, consumption rates oscillated around the mean, and no patterns were observed. The COVID-19 pandemic did not affect trends of antibacterial consumption across the hospital or in the pediatric intensive care unit.

We explore the critical role that farm environments play in shaping AMR dynamics, particularly within the rapidly expanding poultry sector, which is growing to meet the increasing global demand for animal protein. Despite the implementation of practices aimed at reducing antimicrobial use in poultry, the continued presence of antimicrobial residues and resistant bacteria in poultry farm environments may still contribute to the persistence and spread of AMR. Current surveillance efforts primarily focus on retail meat and slaughterhouse samples, neglecting environmental reservoirs. Expanding surveillance to include farm environments is crucial to understanding AMR dynamics. We also emphasize the challenges involved in measuring AMR and suggest that integrating multiple methodologies may offer a more comprehensive understanding of AMR dynamics in farm environments. Integrating environmental monitoring into AMR surveillance strategies within the One Health framework can enhance the identification of critical control points in both agricultural and environmental settings that contribute to the spread of AMR and develop more targeted mitigation strategies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40961968/,10.2460/javma.25.07.0488

Conventional blood cultures remain the Standard-of-Care (SoC) for pathogen identification but are limited by low sensitivity and prolonged turnaround times, hampering timely and targeted antimicrobial stewardship. Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) offer potential for culture-independent, rapid, and comprehensive detection of pathogens and prediction of antimicrobial resistance. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of PISTE™ technology, an NGS-based diagnostic workflow combining full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic analysis for the diagnosis of circulating bacteria in sepsis. In this prospective, multicenter, phase IIa proof-of-concept study, adult patients with suspected sepsis were enrolled from four hospitals in Athens, Greece. Blood samples were collected prior to antibiotic initiation and processed using SoC cultures and PISTE platform. PISTE integrates automated DNA purification (KingFisher, Thermo Fisher Scientific), full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomics analysis (SQK-PRB114.24, Oxford Nanopore Technologies), and real-time sequencing using Oxford Nanopore GridION Mk1b device. A dedicated analysis pipeline was developed for accurate pathogen detection and prediction of antimicrobial resistance profiles. The primary endpoint was the diagnostic concordance between PISTE and SoC cultures. A total of 100 patients (median age 79 years, median Charlson's Comorbidity Index 5) were enrolled. Of these, 71 patients met Sepsis-3 criteria. In this subgroup, PISTE showed an overall accuracy of 95.7%, with a sensitivity of 91.7%, specificity of 96.5%, positive predictive value of 84.6%, and negative predictive value of 98.2% compared to SoC. The median time to pathogen identification and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (AST) with PISTE was 12.0 hours, significantly faster than in SoC cultures (30.4 hours, p < 0.0001). Resistance gene profiling showed strong agreement with SoC AST results, particularly for β-lactam and carbapenem resistance. PISTE technology exhibited high diagnostic accuracy and significantly reduced turnaround time compared to conventional cultures, supporting its potential as a short turnaround time and reliable diagnostic tool for bloodstream infections.

This study aims to investigate the impact of an Antimicrobial Stewardship Program (ASP) on linezolid consumption and susceptibility in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). In particular, for patients with MRSA infection, ensuring optimized anti-MRSA therapy to align with international/national guidelines. A retrospective cohort study was conducted from 01.10.2022 to 31.03.2024 in the ICU of Al-Gomhoreya General Hospital, Alexandria, Egypt. This study included a total of 168 ICU adult patients; older than 18 years old and whom were prescribed anti-MRSA therapy (vancomycin, teicoplanin, or linezolid). The present study assessed the impact of ASP implementation by comparing six months before ASP, i.e. from 01.10.2022 to 31.03.2023 and following ASP implementation from 01.10.2023 to 31.03.2024. Hence, evaluating adherence to hospital protocol for MRSA management and antibiotic timeout process. One of the principal elements that this study focused on was to quantify the consumption of Linezolid before and after ASP implementation, which was measured utilizing the World Health Organization (WHO) standardized Daily Defined Dose (DDD) per 100 patient days. Thus, enabling evaluating the effect of reducing linezolid usage on MRSA susceptibility to Linezolid and analyzing the overall expenditure on anti-MRSA therapy. The comparative analyses were performed using Permutation Welch Two Sample T-test for the continuous measures, while Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test were utilized for categorical outcomes. Following ASP implementation, it was found that adherence to MRSA indication and timeout process significantly increased by approximately 74.3% and 57.9%, with (p values < 0.001 for both), standardized effect sizes (φ) of 0.70 and 0.55, respectively, Linezolid consumption decreased by approximately 85.8% and MRSA sensitivity to Linezolid improved by 18.3%. Furthermore, a reduction of 43% in the overall cost of anti-MRSA therapy was observed. It was found that implementing an ASP contributes to a substantial reduction in Linezolid consumption and preserving its efficacy by maintaining MRSA susceptibility, while improving adherence to hospital protocols and timeout process. Additionally, it reduces overall expenditures on anti-MRSA therapy. These findings highlight ASP as a viable strategy for combating antibiotic resistance, particularly in resource-limited settings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40958105/,10.1186/s12879-025-11510-4

Beyond attributable morbidity and related costs, post-transplant UTI appears to exert a deleterious effect on graft outcomes. Uncertainties on the significance of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and the increasing role as uropathogens of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) further complicate the therapeutic approach. Following a contextualizing introduction on the epidemiology, risk factors and consequences of post-transplant UTI, we reviewed the rationale underlying the 'screen-and-treat' strategy for ASB and the recently generated evidence. Most appropriate regimens for the empirical treatment of cystitis and pyelonephritis are discussed in light of recent microbiological trends. The role of novel antibiotics against MDROs is considered, as well as the management of recurrent UTI and the feasibility of dedicated antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs). Finally, future directions and unmet needs are addressed in the present narrative review. Despite advances to clarify the management of ASB and recent additions to the antibiotic armamentarium, research is needed to optimize the empirical and definitive therapy for post-transplant UTI. This should include the validation of predictive scores for MDRO infection, the effectiveness and safety of novel antibiotics, and the implementation of ASPs in KTRs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40957868/,10.1080/14787210.2025.2561646

A quality improvement initiative took place at a pediatric hospital network, including 4 emergency departments (EDs) and 5 urgent care centers. Children discharged between July 2018 and July 2022 with a community-acquired pneumonia diagnosis and an antibiotic prescribed were included. A 2-part intervention was implemented: (1) an electronic health record order set that preselected 5-day antibiotic therapy (August 2020) and (2) a revised community-acquired pneumonia pathway newly integrated into the electronic health record (April 2021). Proportions of antibiotic encounters receiving amoxicillin, azithromycin, and antibiotic durations of 5 days or fewer were analyzed using statistical process control charts to identify special cause variation. Order set implementation had no effect on pediatric community-acquired pneumonia prescribing. After pathway revision, amoxicillin prescribing increased from 60.6% to 70.9%, azithromycin prescribing decreased from 12.5% to 3.7%, and durations for 5 days or fewer increased from 2.0% to 66.1%. A revised, electronic health record-integrated community-acquired pneumonia pathway was associated with improving already high adherence to guideline-recommended antibiotic choice and reducing antibiotic durations for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in ED and urgent care settings.

Increasing resistance to carbapenems among Acinetobacter baumannii (A.baumannii) has led to using colistin as a last resort. Overuse of colistin will lead to the emergence of colistin resistance as evidenced in the past with other antibiotics. In India, reports of colistin-resistant A.baumannii are emerging. The mutations in the pmrA/pmrB genes may induce colistin resistance. However, increasing the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of colistin and detection of mutations in the pmrB gene may provide information on the possibility of emerging resistance. A total of 50 clinical isolates MDR-AB were subjected to colistin broth microdilution and colistin challenge test. Amongst them, five isolates that had slightly higher MIC were sequenced to detect mutations. Out of 50 isolates, 24 % were isolated from patients who sustained trauma due to road traffic accidents and the majority of them (96 %) required ventilator support. Twenty-seven (56 %) isolates were from patients who developed ventilator-associated pneumonia. The mortality rate was highest (71.4 %) among sepsis cases. The colistin MIC was in the susceptible range in all the isolates. Amongst the five isolates that had slightly higher MIC, only one had a mutation in the pmrB gene. Due to antibiotic pressure, A.baumannii can develop resistance to colistin through genomic mutation. If this trend continues, colistin therapy will become ineffective. This can cause serious implications in the management, especially in critically ill patients. Through a stringent antimicrobial stewardship program (AMSP) the spread of resistance could be controlled.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40953671/,10.1016/j.ijmmb.2025.100971

We retrospectively analyzed 1291 patients who underwent local excision and simple closure of skin tumors at three institutions in Japan between January 2021 and November 2024. Complications were defined as adverse events requiring medical intervention within 30 days postoperatively. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine the cutoff values for age, tumor size, operative time, and surgeon experience. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors. A total of 168 complications occurred in 164 patients (12.7%). The most common symptoms were contact dermatitis (3.7%), wound dehiscence (3.3%), and surgical site infection (2.9%). Multivariate analysis revealed tumor size ≥ 10 mm (odds ratio [OR] 1.52, p = 0.040), operative time ≥ 38 min (OR 1.84, p = 0.012), and surgeon experience ≥ 10 years (OR 1.64, p = 0.013) as significant risk factors. In contrast, intraoperative antibiotic use significantly reduced complication risks (OR 0.29, p < 0.001), especially the risk of surgical site infections (OR 0.32, p = 0.024). No serious or life-threatening events occurred. This study identified key predictors of postoperative complications in skin tumor surgery performed under local anesthesia. Larger tumors, longer operative times, and more experienced surgeons were associated with a higher risk, possibly because of the procedural complexity. Prophylactic intraoperative antibiotics effectively reduce infections and should be considered in high-risk cases. These findings support evidence-based risk assessment and perioperative management of dermatological surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40951948/,10.1111/1346-8138.17958

This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of parents regarding antibiotic use for children with ARIs and to explore the influence of sociodemographic factors on KAP outcomes. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 300 parents attending the Pediatrics Outpatient Department at Sree Balaji Medical College and Hospital, Chennai. Data were collected using a pre-validated structured questionnaire comprising items across knowledge, attitude, and practice domains. Descriptive statistics summarized participant characteristics and KAP scores. Inferential analyses, including chi-square tests, ANOVA, and bivariate regression, were used to assess associations between KAP scores and sociodemographic variables. Reliability and factor analyses validated the internal consistency and construct validity of the questionnaire. Mean scores indicated moderate levels of parental awareness and behavior regarding antibiotic use (Knowledge: 3.67; Attitude: 3.48; Practice: 3.84 on a five-point scale). Parental education, income, place of residence, and number of children were significantly associated with KAP scores (p < 0.05). Parents with fewer children, higher education levels, lower income, and urban residence demonstrated significantly better knowledge and practices. A strong positive correlation was observed between knowledge and practice domains (R = 0.511, p < 0.001), indicating that informed parents were more likely to adopt appropriate antibiotic use behaviors. ANOVA revealed significant differences in KAP scores across different demographic subgroups. The findings highlight the urgent need for targeted health education programs to improve antibiotic-related knowledge and practices, particularly in rural, less-educated, and higher-income populations. Promoting rational antibiotic use among parents may help to curb the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance. Future research should evaluate the impact of educational interventions across diverse communities.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40951046/,10.7759/cureus.89849

Multicenter quasi-experimental study. Three private tertiary referral centers in different geographical locations in India. All consecutive prescriptions with restricted antibiotics for inpatients during the study period. This study was conducted over 15 months from June 2022 to May 2023. The impact of mentoring clinical pharmacists by infectious disease physicians, enhancing their communication abilities for providing proactive feedback, and the impact on prescription practice were measured in terms of new prescriptions of restricted antibiotics, compliance to clinical pharmacist advice, and the duration of restricted antibiotic therapy usage, measured in terms of days of therapy (DOT) of restricted antibiotics. Gross mortality was reviewed as a balancing measure, and dose/dosing errors were considered as a secondary outcome. Data were captured in Microsoft Excel and analyzed using the SPSS software. Clinical pharmacist-led antimicrobial stewardship interventions were found to have a significant impact on decreasing antibiotic prescriptions, increasing healthcare organization policy compliance, and decreasing DOT for restricted antibiotics. Culture sampling, acceptance of antimicrobial stewardship advice, dosing errors, or mortality rates were not statistically significantly related to the other study parameters. Clinical pharmacist-driven AMSP can be effectively implemented irrespective of the cultural and geographical setting due to their ability to improve prescription practices.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40934030/,10.1017/ash.2025.10088

This review explores how both traditional techniques, such as microscopy, culture, and antigen detection, and emerging technologies, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, contribute to clinical decision-making and infection control. These tools not only accelerate pathogen identification and resistance profiling but also support precision medicine approaches tailored to hematologic patient needs. The expanding role of hematology nurses is emphasized, particularly in diagnostic stewardship, specimen collection, result interpretation, and coordination of infection management strategies. Educational interventions have proven effective in reducing contamination rates and improving antimicrobial targeting. Furthermore, novel point-of-care platforms, such as CRISPR-based diagnostics and AI-enhanced digital PCR, are shifting diagnostic capabilities closer to the bedside, redefining nursing workflows and responsibilities. These innovations empower nurses to engage in real-time clinical decisions, monitor therapy responses, and enhance patient education regarding diagnostic procedures and infection risks. However, gaps remain in microbiology-related training and confidence among nurses, highlighting the need for integrated educational curricula and interdisciplinary collaboration. By aligning technological advancements with frontline nursing practice, microbiological diagnostics not only optimize patient outcomes but also elevate the role of nurses as key stakeholders in infection prevention, antimicrobial stewardship, and evidence-based care.

To reduce antibiotic use, non-antimicrobial treatments, such as Uro-Vaxom (OM-89), have been proposed to prevent UTI recurrence by enhancing immune response. Still, despite being available for many years, the evidence for its effectiveness remains unclear. This updated systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy of OM-89 in reducing UTI recurrence, increasing sample size compared to previous reviews. A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, following the PRISMA guidelines. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing OM-89 with placebo in adult patients with a history of recurrent UTIs. Study selection and data extraction were performed by multiple reviewers, and a random-effects model was used for data pooling. Our primary outcome was the recurrence rate of symptomatic UTIs, while secondary endpoints included the rate of positive urine cultures at 3 and 6 months post-intervention. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool, and statistical analysis was conducted using RStudio software. Additionally, we performed a meta-regression incorporating all included studies for primary endpoint. We retrieved eight RCTs, comprising 674 patients in the OM-89 group and 677 patients in the placebo group. Our analysis showed a lower rate of symptomatic UTIs in the intervention group (OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.23-0.97; P<0.01; I Although initial meta-analysis results indicated that OM-89 was effective in reducing UTI recurrence, meta-regression reveals a decline in its efficacy in more recent studies.

This was a retrospective, single-center study with a small sample size. A total of 400 patients admitted to the Departments of Critical Care Medicine or Orthopedics between January 2022 and December 2023 were divided into a control group (n = 200, receiving conventional HAI management) and an experimental group (n = 200, undergoing MDT management). Key outcomes included compliance with infection prevention measures (e.g., isolation signs, disinfection preparation, and dedicated item use), infection control results (e.g., hand hygiene, appropriate antibiotic use, and medical waste disposal), and HAI incidence rates (e.g., MDRO, urinary, pulmonary, bloodstream, and skin infections). Pathogen specimen submission and satisfaction scores were also analyzed. The experimental group demonstrated higher implementation rates of infection prevention and control measures, and better adherence to hand hygiene, disinfection and isolation, appropriate antibiotic usage, dedicated use of medical items, and medical waste disposal, compared to the control group (p < 0.05). MDRO and other infection rates were lower in the experimental group versus the control group (p < 0.05).

40931120,Antimicrobial stewardship from a One Health perspective.,"James R, Hardefeldt LY, Ierano C, Charani E, Dowson L, Elkins S, Thursky K",2025,Nature reviews. Microbiology,"The global rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a profound threat to human, animal and environmental health. Although antimicrobials have revolutionized modern medicine, their overuse and misuse have accelerated AMR, necessitating urgent, multisectoral action. Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS), a set of coordinated strategies that promote responsible antimicrobial use, has emerged as a key intervention in managing AMR. In this Review, we explore AMS within a One Health framework, emphasizing interconnectedness across sectors. We examine clinical, economic, sociocultural and environmental drivers of antimicrobial use, highlighting disparities between high-income and low-income settings and identifying context-specific challenges to implementation. We also discuss the importance of governance, financing, digital innovation, surveillance and behavioural science in shaping sustainable AMS programmes, and we consider core components, such as policy integration, surveillance of appropriateness, and context-aware interventions. This Review ultimately advocates for equity-focused strategies that better account for structural barriers, support marginalized populations, and ensure global access to high-quality antimicrobials. By aligning political will, funding and scientific innovation, AMS programmes can be scaled effectively to preserve antimicrobial efficacy, mitigate AMR, improve health outcomes, and promote global health security. The paper concludes with key recommendations for embedding AMS across sectors as a sustainable response to AMR.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40931120/,10.1038/s41579-025-01233-3 10.1038/s43856-024-00594-9 10.2471/BLT.22.288650 10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2023.106816 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61458-4 10.1177/003335491212700103 10.1038/s41579-021-00649-x 10.1080/16549716.2025.2491200 10.1016/S0924-8579(02)00363-1 10.1038/ja.2015.98 10.1016/j.cmi.2017.08.026 10.1371/journal.ppat.1010537 10.1071/MA24023 10.1016/S0140-6736(24)01867-1 10.1038/s41579-022-00720-1 10.1080/13698575.2024.2345614 10.1016/s14733099(25)001197 10.1016/S0140-6736(19)32989-7 10.1016/j.jgar.2022.03.005 10.1111/jvim.16136 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000352 10.1002/vetr.3268 10.3389/fvets.2018.00029 10.1017/S0950268819001778 10.3390/antibiotics11040487 10.29374/2527-2179.bjvm000822 10.1126/science.aaw1944 10.1016/j.tim.2017.09.005 10.1038/nrmicro3439 10.1016/j.envc.2024.101020 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.01.032 10.3390/antibiotics12040640 10.2471/BLT.22.288614 10.1093/jacamr/dlac015 10.1371/journal.pone.0225124 10.3168/jds.2020-18874 10.1016/S2214-109X(23)00019-0 10.1186/s13756-024-01369-6 10.1016/S0140-6736(24)00862-6 10.1016/S1473-3099(22)00796-4 10.1177/00185787231224066 10.1371/journal.pgph.0002507 10.1186/s13756-023-01344-7 10.3390/antibiotics12081342 10.1186/s12879-023-08398-3 10.1093/jac/dkaa429 10.12688/openreseurope.18016.2 10.3390/antibiotics10030253 10.3389/fvets.2024.1349188 10.1371/journal.pgph.0001526 10.1016/j.onehlt.2020.100145 10.1093/cid/ciw217 10.1177/2042098614554919 10.1016/j.jgar.2021.08.001 10.1093/jacamr/dlac117 10.1016/j.cmi.2018.03.033 10.1016/j.cmi.2019.08.007 10.1017/ash.2023.499 10.3390/healthcare10091706 10.1016/j.ijid.2020.05.126 10.1186/s13756-025-01541-6 10.1016/j.cmi.2017.07.013 10.1017/ice.2019.294 10.1128/CMR.18.4.638-656.2005 10.1093/jacamr/dlab186 10.1016/j.ijid.2024.107306 10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.028 10.1186/s13756-021-00964-1 10.1086/510393 10.1016/j.cmi.2017.04.016 10.1017/ice.2019.29 10.3390/antibiotics11050642 10.1177/0897190020980616 10.1016/j.jss.2011.12.014 10.1093/cid/ciw649 10.1186/s13756-019-0471-0 10.1093/cid/ciw787 10.1007/s40506-018-0151-2 10.4065/mcp.2011.0358 10.1007/s40506-014-0015-3 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.53806 10.1111/avj.12677 10.3390/antibiotics12071162 10.1111/j.1469-0691.2006.01415.x 10.1111/zph.12298 10.1002/gch2.202100017 10.1093/jac/dky118 10.1086/511640 10.1017/ice.2015.46 10.1093/jac/dkx244 10.1007/s15010-014-0649-6 10.1016/j.prevetmed.2020.105221 10.3389/fvets.2020.00063 10.3390/antibiotics13060505 10.1371/journal.pone.0297921 10.1016/j.amjmed.2005.05.007 10.3390/antibiotics9070418 10.1007/s41999-022-00715-4 10.1016/j.cmi.2024.10.017 10.1136/bmjgh-2021-006961 10.1186/s13756-024-01494-2 10.1016/j.mayocp.2018.11.005 10.1016/j.cmi.2024.09.023 10.1136/bmjpo-2020-000643 10.1017/ice.2020.1398 10.7717/peerj.9409 10.1093/jacamr/dlac012 10.3389/fphar.2024.1381843 10.1093/jacamr/dlae059 10.1093/jac/dkae370 10.1016/S2214-109X(23)00554-5 10.1093/jacamr/dlab123 10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00070-7 10.1038/s41467-024-53253-x 10.1016/j.cmi.2025.04.030 10.2307/1229039 10.1056/NEJMp2500489 10.1017/ice.2022.136 10.1093/cid/cit212 10.1016/j.cmi.2022.01.005 10.1093/jac/dkaa001 10.1093/jacamr/dlac007 10.1002/vms3.377 10.1186/1748-5908-7-37 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025101 10.1016/j.ajic.2019.10.010 10.1371/journal.pone.0225011 10.1007/s40121-024-00996-1 10.1007/s11908-019-0683-8 10.1016/j.cmi.2017.02.028 10.1017/ice.2019.51 10.1038/s41579-021-00578-9 10.1017/ice.2023.122 10.1093/jac/dkac096 10.1007/s10096-024-05027-y 10.3390/antibiotics14020134 10.1016/j.artmed.2025.103089 10.1093/jacamr/dlab194 10.1111/avj.12836 10.1093/jacamr/dlad031
40930544,Proximal core strengthening training for anterior cruciate ligament injury prevention with biomechanical improvements in knee/hip kinematics and strength gains: a systematic review and meta-analysis of low-certainty evidence.,"Xiao J, Feng C, Chu J, Zhao W, Zhang B, Yuan X",2025,BMJ open,"This study evaluated the effects of proximal core training on biomechanical risk factors and strength parameters in individuals at high risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury (specifically: those exhibiting pathological movement patterns, neuromuscular deficits or biomechanical risk factors) and compared direct versus indirect interventions. We hypothesised that targeted training enhances dynamic knee stabilisation and hip control during high-risk manoeuvres, with direct approaches providing superior biomechanical benefits through neuromuscular control optimisation. Systematic review and meta-analysis using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. We searched (PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO Academic Search Premier (ASP)+Business Source Premier (BSP)) for relevant literature published between its inception and the date of retrieval (22 April 2024). This study included studies comparing the effects of proximal core intensification training and lower extremity training, evaluated their influences on biomechanical risk factors and strength parameters in three types of high-risk ACL populations, and compared the direct and indirect intervention effects. The three types of people include: (1) athletes with pathological exercise patterns, (2) those with neuromuscular defects after ACL injury/reconstruction and (3) those without injury but with biomechanical risk factors. Two independent reviewers used standardised methods to search, screen and code included studies. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration and Evidence Project tools. A meta-analysis was conducted using random effects models. Findings were summarised in GRADE evidence profiles and synthesised qualitatively. 24 studies with a total of 749 participants were included. Meta-analyses demonstrated that proximal core strengthening training may increase lower extremity muscle strength (quadriceps peak torque: standardised mean differences (SMD)=0.65, 95% CI (0.29 to 1.01), I²=0%; hamstring peak torque: SMD=0.53, 95% CI (0.14 to 0.92), I²=0%; both p<0.05, low-quality evidence). For movement kinematics, task-dependent improvements were observed: peak knee flexion angle likely increased during jumping (SMD=0.58, 95% CI (0.20 to 0.96), I²=32%) and single-leg squatting (SMD=0.60, 95% CI (0.07 to 1.26), I²=0%) (both p≤0.05, low-quality evidence) but may have little meaningful effect during walking (low-quality evidence). Peak hip flexion may substantially increase during jumping (SMD=0.83, 95% CI (0.19 to 1.47), I²=0%, p<0.05, low-quality evidence), while core endurance may improve (plank time: SMD=0.63, 95% CI (0.12 to 1.13), I²=0%, p<0.05, low-quality evidence). Proximal core training has the potential to improve core endurance, knee kinematics and lower limb strength in individuals at high risk of ACL injury, but evidence remains limited to late postoperative and exercise studies. Standardised protocols and harm rate validation are needed to confirm the preventive effectiveness of multidimensional protocols.

Post-intervention, antibiotic consumption declined by -35.96% (95%CI: -49.34 to -22.57), and the proportion of broad-spectrum antibiotic use decreased by -41.97% (-61.74 to -22.20). Consumption dropped significantly in both moderately developed areas and underdeveloped areas, while highly developed areas saw the largest reduction in broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Rural PHIs also showed notable declines in both overall antibiotic consumption and broad-spectrum usage.

They are at greater risk of receiving suboptimal or inappropriate care, yet guidance to support AMS practices for this population remains limited. To investigate antibiotic knowledge, perspectives, and experiences of CALD patients. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May to November 2023 at a Western Sydney tertiary hospital. Adult patients of CALD background on systemic antibiotics for more than 72 hours under surgical, respiratory, and geriatric specialties were surveyed on their understanding of their antibiotic treatment. Of the 177 patients, median age was 70 years old (21-99 years), and 95/177 (53.7%) were males. Of the 177 patients, 171/177 (96.6%) reported speaking a language other than English at home. While 160/177 (90.4%) patients were told that they were treated with antibiotics, only 67/177 (37.9%) were told about duration, 35/177 (19.8%) were told about the side effects, and 27/177 (15.3%) were given written information. Information was provided by doctors to 125/177 (70.6%) patients, 72/177 (40.7%) by nurses, and 3/177 (1.7%) by pharmacists. Patients preferred to have received information from their doctor 79/177 (44.6%) or any healthcare professional 91/177 (51.4%).

Promoting de-implementation of ineffective antimicrobial use and increasingly of low-value diagnostic testing are cornerstones of stewardship practice. Principles of de-implementation science and the interplay of implementation and de-implementation are discussed in part I of this Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America White Paper Series.In this second part of the series, we discuss a process for applying principles of de-implementation science in infection prevention and stewardship and then review some real-world examples and case studies, including a national blood culture shortage, contact precautions, and surgical and dental prophylaxis. We use these examples to demonstrate how barriers and facilitators can be mapped to evidence-informed implementation/de-implementation strategies to promote efforts to reduce low-value, ineffective, or out-of-date practices. These real-world examples highlight the need for infection prevention and stewardship programs to adapt to changing evidence, contexts, and conditions. Although barriers to practice change are often a bit different, de-implementation can sometimes be thought of as the implementation of a new program-but the new program aims to stop rather than start doing something.As the saying goes, sometimes less really is more. Medicine and public health have a strong action bias and a strong aversion to risk and uncertainty. Although our best intentions may point us to implementing more interventions, often, the best medicine instead dictates that we do less, or nothing at all. Leveraging principles of de-implementation science can help move healthcare in the right direction when interventions are low-value, ineffective, or no longer needed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40926570/,10.1017/ice.2025.76

The American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Urgent Care Medicine and Pediatric Acute and Critical Care Quality Network developed a multicenter quality improvement collaborative. We used national guidelines to determine criteria for nonsevere AOM and first-line antibiotics for AOM and pharyngitis. Participating UCCs committed at least 3 clinicians to submit 10 encounters for each diagnosis per month during the intervention period (October 2022 to June 2023). Clinicians signed commitment letters, participated in monthly learning sessions, and tested UCC-selected interventions. We recruited 84 participants from 13 UCCs. Participants submitted 5017 AOM encounters and 3762 pharyngitis encounters. The use of first-line antibiotics for AOM and GAS pharyngitis remained stable at 75.7% and 79.9%, respectively, throughout the project. The documentation of delayed antibiotic criteria increased from a range of 26%-27% at baseline to 83% [5.42% per month (95% CI: 4.03-6.81)]. This corresponded to an increase in use of delayed antibiotics for AOM from a range of 32%-42% at baseline to 70% by the end of the intervention period [2.53% per month (95% CI: 0.57-4.48)]. Rates of GAS testing before treating pharyngitis increased during baseline and remained high (>96%) throughout the intervention period.

Accurately determining the incidence of HCAIs is crucial for planning and implementing efficient interventions, as they are associated with a wide range of challenges. The objective of this study was to assess and update the incidence rates of HCAIs in Iran in 2023, using data from the Iranian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance (INIS) system, a nationwide hospital-based surveillance program. The Iranian Center for Communicable Diseases Control (ICDC) evaluated data from 1,066 hospitals using the INIS software. Hospitals' trained infection control staff collected all information and entered it into the INIS. HCAIs were diagnosed based on the CDC/NHSN case definition criteria. We calculated incidence rate (per 100 admissions and per 1,000 patient-days). We reported 170,948 HCAIs among 11,043,373 hospitalized patients, with an incidence rate of 4.95 per 1,000 patient-days, and the crude mortality rate of 19.85%. Looking at the relative frequencies, Pneumonia was the most frequent infection (28.32%), followed by urinary tract infections (UTIs) (26.6%), and surgical site infections (SSIs) (21.85%). HCAI rates were highest in intensive care units (ICUs), transplant wards, and burn units, with major surgeries like cardiovascular, neurosurgeries, and orthopedics having the highest SSI rates. The most common microorganisms were Klebsiella spp. (16.56%) and E. coli (14.6%), with high proportions of multidrug-resistance (MDR) including MRSA (43.2%), VRE (65.24%), and KPC (74.21%). This study reveals a high incidence of HCAIs in Iranian hospitals in 2023, with pneumonia, UTIs, and SSIs being most common. The high proportion of MDR pathogens underscores the need for enhanced infection control, antibiotic stewardship program, and continuous staff education to reduce HCAIs and improve patient outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40924295/,10.1007/s44197-025-00462-2

40923421,Effectiveness of a penicillin allergy delabeling program-real-world data from Croatia.,"Marković I, Barišić J, Aksentijević MB, Lokner I, Lazarević VV",2025,Allergologia et immunopathologia,"Penicillin allergy is the most commonly reported drug allergy, often leading to unnecessary avoidance of beta-lactam antibiotics, increased use of alternative broad-spectrum antibiotics, and higher healthcare costs. However, studies indicate that over 90% of penicillin allergy labels are erroneous. This study presents real-world data from a penicillin allergy delabeling program conducted at the Special Hospital for Pulmonary Diseases in Zagreb, Croatia. A total of 132 adult patients with a reported beta-lactam allergy were evaluated with a stepwise diagnostic protocol, including medical history review, skin tests, specific IgE, and drug provocation tests. Five patients were delabeled directly, while 127 underwent diagnostic testing. Among 121 participants who completed the protocol, penicillin allergy was confirmed in 13 (10.74%) patients, and the label was retained in an additional 3 patients because of high-risk history, resulting in an overall confirmed allergy rate of 13.2%. The negative predictive values for STs were 99.07% and 94.39% for immediate and delayed reactions, respectively, while the NPV of sIgE for immediate reactions was 100%. No severe reactions occurred during the diagnostic process. Hundred and five out of one hundred and thirty two (79.5%) patients were safely delabeled. These findings confirm the safety and effectiveness of PAD programs in outpatient settings and highlight the potential for improving antibiotic stewardship by reducing unnecessary beta-lactam avoidance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40923421/,10.15586/aei.v53i5.1360 10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32218-9 10.1056/NEJMra1807761 10.3389/falgy.2022.853587 10.5414/ALX02310E 10.1111/all.13848 10.1016/j.waojou.2024.100958 10.1016/j.jaci.2013.09.021 10.1136/bmj.k2400 10.3390/antibiotics11081055 10.1111/all.12142 10.1016/S0010-4825(00)00006-8 10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.0403 10.1001/jamainternmed.2023.1572 10.1016/j.jaip.2021.05.037 10.1016/j.waojou.2023.100829 10.1016/j.jaci.2020.04.058 10.1111/all.15508 10.1007/s11882-014-0459-z 10.1186/s13223-015-0098-5 10.1111/all.14122 10.1111/pai.12565 10.5414/ALX02104E 10.1159/000541243 10.1034/j.1398-9995.2001.00995.x 10.3390/antibiotics13040345
40923339,Genomic prediction and genome-wide association study for liver abscesses in crossbred beef cattle.,"Bradford HL, Kuehn LA, Snelling WM, Keel BN, Jones SA, Thallman RM, Lindholm-Perry AK",2025,Journal of animal science,"Liver abscesses are a concern in feedlot cattle, and little is known about the role of genetics in their development. This study aimed to estimate genetic parameters and to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with liver abscesses. Crossbred cattle representing 18 breeds in the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center Germplasm Evaluation Program were phenotyped for liver abscesses at slaughter (n = 9,044). Seventeen percent of cattle had liver abscesses. These cattle had genotypes that were imputed to sequence variant genotypes. After filtering and quality control, 340,723 SNPs were used in the analysis. Liver abscess prevalence was modeled with a single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction (ssGBLUP) threshold model using a Bayesian framework. The model included contemporary group (sex, treatment group, and slaughter date), additive genomic, and residual effects. Genomic heritability was 0.039 (95% highest posterior density = 0.005, 0.081), which was very small. To assess prediction quality, a 5-fold random cross-validation structure was used. Method Linear Regression was used to assess accuracy, bias, and dispersion by comparing estimated breeding values (EBV) from full and reduced analyses. Cross-validation metrics showed EBV based on genotypes had 0.05 reliability (SD < 0.01) with no bias relative to EBV based on genotypes and phenotypes. For the genome-wide association study, SNP effects were back calculated from the EBV solutions from ssGBLUP. No SNPs were associated with liver abscesses at a Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted 0.05 significance level. Although a large dataset was used, this result was because of the low genomic heritability and imprecise EBV used to calculate SNP effects. Based on these results, environmental factors contribute to most of the variation in liver abscesses. Genetic selection to reduce liver abscesses would be slow because of the low genomic heritability, measurement late in life, and inability to measure breeding animals. A faster approach would be finding additional environmental interventions that maintain animal performance. Liver abscesses cost the beef industry millions of dollars annually through reduced carcass weight and less efficient growth. Liver abscesses have been most often prevented by feeding prophylactic antibiotics. With pressure to reduce antibiotic use, other measures are needed to reduce liver abscess prevalence. Liver abscesses affect 10 to 20% of beef carcasses but can occur in 50% of individual lots. Genetic selection could be a permanent and cumulative approach to reducing liver abscesses. A population of 9,044 genotyped crossbred cattle was used to understand the genetics of liver abscesses. Based on this research, genetics has a very small contribution to the development of liver abscesses. The heritability was near 0, suggesting little variation in liver abscesses was genetic. In addition, no candidate genes were identified as affecting liver abscess development. Because liver abscesses are primarily determined by environmental factors, management strategies will be more effective than genetic selection at reducing liver abscesses in beef cattle. These strategies could include dietary changes like feeding antibiotics, increasing roughage, increasing particle size, and lengthening the transition period.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40923339/,10.1093/jas/skaf275 10.1093/jas/skaa359 10.1186/s12711-019-0469-3 10.2527/jas.2015-0161 10.2527/jas.2015-0261 10.1111/j.2517-6161.1995.tb02031.x 10.1111/jbg.12507 10.15232/aas.2023-02498 10.1093/jas/skaf048 10.1111/jbg.12860 10.15232/aas.2023-02482 10.15232/aas.2021-02228 10.1093/jas/skaf029 10.1111/asj.12470 10.1186/1297-9686-45-30 10.2527/jas.2015-9887 10.1186/s12711-018-0426-6 10.3168/jds.2009-2061 10.1093/bioinformatics/btp324 10.1071/an21257 10.15232/aas.2023-02503 10.1186/s12711-023-00839-6 10.2527/1998.761287x 10.1016/j.cvfa.2007.05.002 10.3168/jds.2016-10854 10.15232/pas.2014-01364 10.1038/s41588-020-00756-0 10.1038/s41588-023-01438-3 10.1186/1471-2164-15-442 10.15232/aas.2023-02490 10.3168/jds.2019-16985 10.3390/genes11111312 10.1016/j.livsci.2024.105478 10.2527/jas.2016-0621 10.1186/1297-9686-43-10 10.1017/S0016672312000274 10.2527/jas2017.1743 10.3389/fgene.2024.1380643 10.1093/jas/skae234.052
40921638,Views of Spanish primary care professionals on respiratory tract infection testing: a qualitative study.,"Moragas A, Cots JM, Llor C",2025,BMJ open,"Respiratory tract infection tests are increasingly available in primary care and are expected to expand in the future. However, there is limited understanding of clinicians' views on their benefits and how to effectively integrate them into daily clinical practice. The aim of this study was to explore healthcare professionals' views on using respiratory tract infection tests to safely reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions for respiratory tract infections in primary care based on their experience in routine practice. A qualitative study design was employed. Two focus group discussions were conducted. These focus group discussions were conducted in February 2025, involving 18 Spanish primary care professionals, both experts and non-experts in rational antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance. Data were audio-recorded or video-recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. Participants agreed that respiratory tract infection tests help optimise antibiotic prescriptions, reduce uncertainty, ensure the appropriate consumption of resources and guide treatment based on aetiology. While most professionals view microbiological tests and C-reactive protein testing as complementary, non-experts preferred microbiological tests. Professionals considered that patients value knowing the aetiology over the prognosis, supporting shared decision-making and addressing patients' demands more effectively. Concerns remain about using these tests as stand-alone tools and the medicalisation of self-limiting conditions. Other barriers mentioned included the high cost and time-consuming nature, the need for better professional training and the challenge of managing the increased workload associated with their use. This study highlights how clinicians perceive respiratory tract infection tests to aid prescribing decisions amid uncertainty. Both positive and negative views were reported. Participants agreed that these tests optimise antibiotic prescriptions and guide treatment, but there are still important barriers to their implementation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40921638/,10.1136/bmjopen-2025-102476 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)17907-0 10.1136/bmj.c2096 10.1136/bmjopen-2014-006245 10.3389/fpubh.2024.1397096 10.1586/14787210.2016.1151353 10.3389/fcimb.2022.807253 10.1186/s13054-024-05224-3 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-023925 10.1080/00365540410019372 10.3399/bjgp20X709865 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-012503 10.3399/BJGPO.2024.0024 10.3399/BJGP.2024.0413 10.1093/fampra/cmab002 10.1007/s11606-014-3076-6 10.1007/s11096-021-01368-2 10.4187/respcare.03275 10.1186/1471-2296-12-93 10.1111/irv.12258

In rural China, antibiotic use is common for acute respiratory infections (ARIs), which include symptoms such as coughing and fever that are most likely viral infections but with a small proportion as bacterial infections. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a comprehensive intervention based on C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A point-of-care testing (CRP&SAA POCT) in reducing the inappropriate use of antibiotics for ARIs in Chinese village clinics. This is a pragmatic, parallel-group, controlled, cluster-randomised, superiority trial featuring blinded outcome evaluation and data analysis, along with unblinded treatment. This study will be conducted over a period of six months across 40 village clinics in Hubei, China. CRP&SAA POCT will be implemented in 20 village clinics within the intervention arm. This will include additional training for village doctors on the operations of CRP&SAA POCT, which encompasses centralised training, the distribution of training manuals, and desk reminders. Patient education materials will be provided to assist patients in understanding how CRP&SAA POCT can aid in their diagnosis and treatment. The control arm will not receive any intervention except the usual care. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients of all age groups who are diagnosed with ARIs and prescribed antibiotics during their initial visit in both study arms. All analyses will be conducted using the intention-to-treat approach. Our study is one of the first trials utilizing CRP&SAA POCT to address the inappropriate prescription of antibiotics for ARIs in village clinics in China.

Despite their clinical significance, research concentrating on the epidemiology, outcomes, and risk factors influencing mortality in older cancer patients is still limited. This study aims to examine the epidemiology of bloodstream infections and factors contributing to mortality among older cancer patients. This retrospective cohort study was conducted at Etlik City Hospital from January to December 2023. The subjects included cancer patients aged 65 years and older who had experienced bloodstream infections and received a minimum of 48 hours of antimicrobial therapy. Data, including demographics, clinical features, microbiological findings, and antimicrobial therapy, were collected. Bloodstream infections were categorized as either hospital-acquired or community-acquired infections and further classified by their source. Among 160 bloodstream infection episodes observed, 68.8% of them occurred in patients with solid tumors, while 31.3% were found in those with hematological malignancies. Hospital-acquired infections comprised 78.8% of the total cases. Mortality was significantly associated with inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy, carbapenem resistance, and multidrug resistance. Additionally, patients who presented with septic shock and fungal infections had higher mortality rates. The findings underscore the urgent need for early implementation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy and effective infection control measures. The persistence of multidrug resistance and hospital-acquired infections presents critical challenges in reducing mortality rates among older cancer patients.

This systematic review examines the roles of Community Animal Health Workers (CAHWs) and Community Health Workers (CHWs) in antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) across Africa where AMR burden is highest and AMS programs are limited. Following PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review analyzed 16 studies (2017-2024) from nine African nations. We identified seven key roles of CAHWs and CHWs in AMS: 1) provision of clinical services (13 studies); 2) community mobilization (8 studies); 3) health promotion (7 studies); 4) provision of preventive services (5 studies); 5) epidemiological surveillance (4 studies); 6) advocacy (2 studies), and 7) medical waste management (2 studies). Despite their roles, challenges such as lack of supportive legislation (3 studies), inadequate remuneration (2 studies), and total reliance on foreign funding hinder AMS program sustainability. While most studies (14 studies) indicated that CAHWs and CHWs had received AMS training, their roles in the national AMR strategies remain unclear. CAHW and CHWs could be leveraged in advancing health promotion, raising AMR awareness, supporting AMR surveillance, enhancing integrated management of diseases, and improving waste management within One Health frameworks. To realize this potential, there is a need to formalize CAHW/CHW roles through targeted legislation, specialized training and sustainable funding. This evidence highlights the critical need for policy reforms to harness their potential in strengthening health systems and curbing AMR across Africa. PROSPERO registration number: CRD420251027215. Antimicrobial resistance is a global health that is most pronounced in Africa, where the overuse and misuse of antibiotics among humans and animals is very common. This review set out to identify the roles of Community Health and Animal Health Workers in promoting responsible use of antibiotics (antimicrobial stewardship) across Africa. In this review that included 16 studies from nine African countries, published between 2017 and 2024, we noted that community health and animal health workers provided the following antimicrobial stewardship related services; clinical treatment, community mobilization, health promotion, preventative services, diseases surveillance, advocacy and medical waste management in the communities they served. Despite the roles performed by community health and animal health workers, such programs face challenges such as poor funding frameworks, lack of enabling government policy nor legislation and poor provision of renumeration. Even though most articles reported training, their roles in antimicrobial resistance national action plans remain unclear. These workers could play a bigger role in stopping the spread of AMR by educating people, helping track drug resistance, and supporting public health efforts. To do this, governments need to create clear laws, provide proper training, and secure local sustainable funding.

A decade after the WHO recommended global AMR awareness campaigns to assess people's knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP), we reviewed existing KAP studies conducted among populations considered vulnerable, marginalized or deprived by SDoH indicators. We conducted a sub-analysis of KAP studies from a broader systematic review that explored the intersection of SDoH, AMR, infections and vulnerable populations. We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO and Scopus for studies published in English between 2000 and 2022. Titles, abstracts and full texts were screened, and qualitative analysis performed using thematic coding. Key findings were synthesized using a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) framework. Of the 126 papers included in the original review, 40 KAP studies met the inclusion criteria for this sub-analysis. Studies reported limited public knowledge about AMR and widespread practices of antibiotic self-medication. Existing recommendations emphasized continued health education. Although KAP studies describe 'what' antibiotic use behaviours are prevalent, they rarely address 'why' these behaviours occur-particularly in the context of SDoH and cultural norms. There is a pressing need to shift the research focus toward upstream drivers of behaviour, rather than solely on individual actions. Current KAP studies prioritize individual behaviours without adequately considering the broader social, structural and environmental determinants. While these upstream factors remain unaddressed, the practice of sub-optimal self-medication is likely to persist, despite ongoing education efforts.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40917193/,10.1093/jacamr/dlaf141 10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02724-0 10.1016/j.onehlt.2025.100986 10.1016/S0140-6736(24)01019-5 10.1016/S2214-109X(23)00554-5 10.1093/jacamr/dlaf033 10.1016/j.puhe.2021.08.009 10.1016/j.ijid.2015.12.019 10.1007/s11524-012-9692-8 10.1016/S2214-109X(23)00019-0 10.3390/antibiotics12111613 10.3389/fvets.2021.645851 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-028224 10.1177/0253717620946111 10.1093/jacamr/dlab123 10.1136/bmjgh-2024-017389 10.1177/109019818801500203 10.1037/h0054346 10.1186/s12889-020-09204-4 10.1016/j.tmaid.2018.02.004 10.21203/rs.3.rs-56378/v1 10.1186/s12889-017-4261-4 10.1108/Ijhrh-06-2018-0039 10.1080/14787210.2019.1620105 10.1371/journal.pone.0260096 10.1002/pds.4429 10.1016/j.ypmed.2004.05.016 10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2004.03.001 10.1186/s13756-022-01169-w 10.15585/mmwr.mm6428a5 10.1371/journal.pone.0138179 10.2147/IDR.S348765 10.3390/antibiotics11040454 10.1155/2019/9398536 10.1177/004947550003000105 10.1016/j.japh.2019.03.004 10.3390/antibiotics11060714 10.1186/s12889-019-7718-9 10.1080/14787210.2020.1769477 10.3390/geriatrics4040061 10.1097/00006199-200603000-00004 10.3399/bjgp16X686809 10.1186/s12889-018-5614-3 10.1136/bmjopen-2019-030845 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-055464 10.1071/HC09030 10.1186/s12889-022-12855-0 10.3389/fpubh.2022.1074154 10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046432 10.1186/s13756-019-0636-x 10.1186/s13756-020-00862-y 10.3390/antibiotics11121751 10.3390/antibiotics11060823 10.1186/s12992-020-00637-5 10.3390/antibiotics8030135 10.3855/jidc.11938 10.4103/aihb.aihb_119_24 10.1080/21645515.2020.1780846 10.3390/antibiotics11040445 10.1016/S2542-5196(21)00280-1 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-019492 10.3390/antibiotics7040095 10.1038/d41586-022-03389-x 10.1016/s2542-5196(18)30186-4 10.5688/ajpe7627 10.1080/10410236.2021.1875557 10.1111/1753-6405.13265 10.1017/ice.2015.342 10.1038/545023a

Intensive Care Units (ICUs) are particularly susceptible to AMR due to frequent invasive procedures, extended hospital stays, and the selective pressure exerted by broad-spectrum antibiotics. This review aims to shed light on the current landscape of antibiotic resistance within ICUs of Saudi hospitals. It also explores molecular patterns of bacterial resistance and identifies potential strategies to address this issue. Additionally, it discusses the challenges in implementing these strategies within the Saudi healthcare system. We conducted a literature search across electronic databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Google Scholar, until September 30th, 2024, to identify relevant studies. Selected studies were analyzed to extract insights into prevailing bacterial resistance trends in Saudi ICUs and the molecular mechanisms responsible. Our findings provide an overview of the current state of AMR in Saudi ICUs, including the emergence and prevalence of specific molecular patterns of bacterial resistance. Moreover, it presents potential strategies to combat antibiotic resistance, including antimicrobial stewardship programs, infection control measures, and the development of new antibiotics. It also highlights the inherent challenges in implementing these strategies within the unique healthcare landscape of Saudi Arabia. The increasing emergence and spread of MDR bacteria in Saudi Arabia are attributed to the unoptimized antibiotic use, over-the-counter antibiotics without prescription, a high volume of international travellers, and challenges in adherence to infection control practices. Addressing the challenges and implementing effective prevention strategies are critical to maintaining antibiotic efficacy and combating AMR. Several strategies have been employed by the National AMR Committee, in partnership with WHO, to address antibiotic resistance in intensive care units. AMR in Saudi ICUs is a pressing concern requiring immediate attention. A multifaceted approach combining surveillance, education, and policy interventions is essential to overcome this issue. Addressing AMR is crucial for global efforts to preserve the efficacy of antibiotics and maintain the effectiveness of critical healthcare interventions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40916433/,10.2174/0127724328391436250902082555

Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) addresses this by promoting judicious use of antimicrobials. This study evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of an AMS program in district hospitals in Vietnam. A before-and-after study was undertaken in four district hospitals in Vietnam over 6 months. Interventions included (i) establishing AMS committees and teams, (ii) distribution of antimicrobial guidelines, (iii) healthcare worker training, and (iv) conducting periodic standardised audits of appropriateness of antimicrobial prescriptions, followed by tailored feedback. The co-primary outcomes were (i) monthly antimicrobial consumption in the hospital and (ii) appropriateness of antimicrobial prescribing according to guidelines, before and after the AMS program. Secondary outcomes included changes in antimicrobial costs and all-cause mortality. The AMS program was successfully implemented with strong stakeholder engagement and high staff participation across all four hospitals. At baseline, 79.0 % (95 % CI: 74.9 %, 83.7 %) of 454 antimicrobial prescriptions were inappropriate, primarily due to prolonged duration, overly broad-spectrum agents, or incorrect dosing. No improvement was observed post-intervention, with 80.3 % (95 % CI: 77.4 %, 83.1 %) of 992 prescriptions deemed inappropriate. A modest reduction in antimicrobial consumption was seen post-intervention, with a decrease of 4.2 DDD/100 bed-days per month (95 % CI: - 6.2, - 2.3). Antimicrobial costs were unchanged. All-cause mortality reduced post-intervention [RR = 0.32 (95 % CI: 0.09, 0.92)]. AMS interventions were feasible to implement in district hospitals in Vietnam and resulted in modest reductions in antimicrobial consumption and all-cause mortality. However, the persistently high rates of inappropriate prescribing highlight the need for broader implementation and strengthening of stewardship efforts to more effectively address key drivers of antimicrobial resistance at the district level.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40916314/,10.1016/j.jiph.2025.102943

Infectious diseases,"Most countries have endorsed a national action plan (NAP) on antimicrobial resistance. We previously used a governance framework to assess NAPs on antimicrobial resistance available for the period of 2020-21 from 114 countries, finding substantial variation worldwide in the commitment of resources to address an escalating global health challenge. We sought to expand and advance this analysis to include the NAPs of more low-income and middle-income countries, to cover the period of 2021-22, and to examine the strength of NAPs to address antimicrobial resistance. In this systematic governance analysis, we searched ten repositories from their inception to April 1, 2023, to identify all publicly retrievable NAPs on antimicrobial resistance, with no language restrictions. Machine learning tools and artificial intelligence were used to translate all native-language NAPs into English. Three researchers independently conducted a detailed content analysis of new and updated NAPs on antimicrobial resistance. 22 057 datapoints were mapped against a governance framework and a numerical system was developed to quantify country scores for 54 indicators, 18 domains, and three governance areas. We applied principal component analysis to construct country scores between 0 and 100. Through Pearson's correlation coefficient, we evaluated the correlation between the country scores and various metrics pertaining to the burden of antibiotic-resistant infections from the IHME GRAM project. 161 countries and territories were included in this analysis, 47 more than the previous report. Governance scores varied across countries, with Norway achieving the highest score (score of 100) and Djibouti the lowest (score of 0). Generally, higher scores were seen in high-income countries (eg, France, USA, UK, Sweden, and Denmark), whereas lower scores were more common in low-income countries. High-income regions performed well across governance domains, whereas lower scores were seen in other regions (eg, Libya, Central African Republic, South Sudan, and Seychelles). Higher governance scores were significantly associated with a lower burden of antimicrobial resistance-associated disability-adjusted life-years (r=-0·469, p<0·001) and death (r=-0·477, p<0·001). Infection prevention and control (r=-0·532, Bonferroni-adjusted p<0·001), surveillance (r=-0·482, Bonferroni-adjusted p<0·001), and stewardship (r=-0·459, Bonferroni-adjusted p<0·001) were the domains most strongly correlated with a lower burden of drug-resistant infections. The global response to antimicrobial resistance was greatly affected by the income level of the nation, highlighting global disparities in antimicrobial resistance governance capacity. Lower scores in lower-income regions likely reflect systemic challenges, such as less public health spending and less access clean water and santiation. Implementation tools should be prioritised in the design and execution of NAPs, especially measures that improve infection prevention and control, surveillance systems for antimicrobial use, and stewardship programmes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40914183/,10.1016/S1473-3099(25)00406-2

Erysipelas and cellulitis are the most common community-acquired SSTIs. Erysipelas is typically caused by pyogenic streptococci, while cellulitis often has a staphylococcal etiology. Dia-gnosis of erysipelas and cellulitis is primarily clinical and may be supported by the NEW HAvUN scoring system. Treat-ment is based on the use of narrow-spectrum antibiotics primarily targeting gram-positive bacteria. In the Czech Republic, intramuscular forms of penicillin G (procaine penicillin G for treatment and benzathine penicillin G for prophylaxis) are used for erysipelas in certain situations for historical reasons. For cellulitis, oxacillin, flucloxacillin, or cefazolin are commonly employed. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is only justified when an atypical etiology is suspected (including gram-negative or anaerobic bacteria), in high-risk patient groups, or following animal bites or exposure to aquatic environments. The article also lists second-line antibiotics for patients with a beta-lactam allergy. The standard duration of antibiotic therapy should not exceed 10 days, and it is often shorter (five to seven days). In cases of necrotizing fasciitis or myonecrosis, early diagnosis, prompt surgical intervention, intensive care, and antibiotic treatment - typically a combination of a beta-lactam and clindamycin, based on the likely pathogen and entry site - are crucial. The text highlights the importance of sound clinical judgment and appropriate antibiotic use as essential strategies to prevent the overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics and curb antimicrobial resistance.

This retrospective study included 92 patients with malignant tumours (46 CDI-positive, 46 CDI-negative) admitted to our hospital. Demographic characteristics, clinical parameters, laboratory indicators and treatment factors were collected and analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for CDI, and a predictive model was established and evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Patients with CDI had significantly lower serum albumin levels (30.12 ± 5.86 vs 34.15 ± 7.88 g/L, P = 0.007) and higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (89.38 ± 91.01 vs 49.17 ± 51.78 mg/L, P = 0.011) than patients without CDI. The CDI-positive group had significantly higher rates of multiple antibiotic use (52.2 % vs 10.9 %, P < 0.001) and corticosteroid/immunosuppressant use (58.7 % vs 30.4 %, P = 0.007) than the CDI-negative group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified four independent risk factors for CDI: multiple antibiotic use (odds ratio [OR] = 7.56, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 2.41-23.73, P < 0.001), corticosteroid/immunosuppressant use (OR = 2.81, 95 % CI: 1.08-7.32, P = 0.035), serum albumin (per g/L increase: OR = 0.94, 95 % CI: 0.88-1.00, P = 0.049) and CRP (per mg/L increase: OR = 1.01, 95 % CI: 1.00-1.01, P = 0.047). The multivariate predictive model demonstrated excellent discriminative ability (area under the curve = 0.907). Multiple antibiotic use, corticosteroid/immunosuppressant therapy, hypoalbuminaemia and elevated CRP are independent risk factors for CDI in patients with malignant tumours.

This review synthesizes current evidence on infection prevention and control (IPC) strategies in the ICU setting, highlighting recent findings and innovations in this evolving field, particularly in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The review outlines ten key IPC strategies for ICUs, categorizing them into horizontal (universal) and vertical (pathogen-specific) approaches. Recent literature emphasizes the importance of enhanced hand hygiene compliance through motivational interventions and feedback. The role of selective decontamination strategies remains debated, with evidence suggesting potential benefits in specific patient subgroups. Vertical strategies, including active screening for MDROs and per-pathogen bundles, are increasingly being tailored based on local epidemiology and pathogen characteristics. Studies suggest that de-escalating routine contact precautions for certain MDROs like Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus may be safe in settings with robust horizontal measures. Conversely, intensified ""search and destroy"" strategies show promise in controlling carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii outbreaks. Effective IPC in the ICU requires a multifaceted and adaptable approach, integrating both universal precautions and targeted interventions against specific pathogens. While consistent implementation of horizontal strategies like hand hygiene is foundational, tailoring vertical strategies based on local MDRO epidemiology and patient risk profiles is crucial. Future research should focus on harmonizing IPC policies, optimizing screening methods, and evaluating the long-term impact of combined IPC and antimicrobial stewardship programs to improve patient outcomes and mitigate the spread of antimicrobial resistance in critical care settings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40910660/,10.1097/MCC.0000000000001313

Addressing community pharmacies AS barriers can significantly enhance AS efforts, to ensure optimal patient outcomes while combating antibiotic resistance. A cross-sectional survey was distributed to community pharmacies throughout Utah. The survey collected data on pharmacy demographics, AS knowledge, implementation practices, perceived barriers and potential facilitators related to AS. Out of 110 respondents, 50% worked in privately owned pharmacies, and 78.7% held a Doctorate in Pharmacy. While 71.6% were familiar with ASP, 28.4% were not. Major barriers to implementing AS in community pharmacies included limited access to patient data (79.8%) and the absence of standardized AS guidelines (53%). Pharmacists identified several key facilitators that could support AS implementation, which included access to guidelines (75.2%) and better collaboration with providers (75.2%). Additionally, (86.4%) of pharmacists highlighted improved access to patient records was essential or effective for AS implementation. However, only (47.7%) of pharmacists consistently intervened when an antibiotic dosage or frequency appeared inappropriate, which indicates potential gaps in AS-related interventions.

The prevalence of HAI was 6.0 % (95 % CI: 4.4-7.9). The number of antimicrobials administered per 100 patients ranged from 24.1 in small hospitals to 109.6 in university hospitals. CAI treatment was the most common indication in community hospitals, SP in specific centers, and MP in university hospitals. The most commonly prescribed antimicrobials were cefotaxime for CAI, meropenem for HAI, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for MP, and cefazolin for SP. A total of 78 CAIs and 46 HAIs were identified, with AST intervention rates of 2.5 % and 34.8 %, respectively. This subgroup analysis provides the first demographic data on AMU among pediatric inpatients at Japanese hospitals. The distinct distribution of AMU suggests that different approaches are necessary to promote antimicrobial stewardship in hospital settings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40907788/,10.1016/j.jiac.2025.102804

The Sharing Antimicrobial Reports for Pediatric Stewardship-Outpatient Collaborative shared quarterly benchmarking reports with 22 institutions on antibiotic prescribing metrics (percentage of acute and acute respiratory infection [ARI] encounters with antibiotic prescriptions, duration of ≤ 7days, and among ARI, rates of amoxicillin and azithromycin use) for emergency departments, urgent care clinics, and primary care clinics. In January 2024, a survey assessed stewardship strategies and the impact of the benchmarking reports. We compared baseline (January 2019-December 2022) with the benchmarking period (January 2023-September 2024). We included 32.4 million acute encounters. Although antibiotic prescribing increased in the benchmarking period, we saw increased amoxicillin use, decreased azithromycin use, and decreased antibiotic duration. The odds of receiving antibiotics for ARI were variable across practice settings and strategies, although institutions that used guidelines, electronic record features, and quality improvement projects observed lower antibiotic and azithromycin use and higher amoxicillin use. Although we did not observe a decrease in antibiotic prescribing for ARI after providing benchmarking reports, there was improvement in antibiotic selection. Guidelines and quality improvement initiatives may have the biggest impact on antibiotic prescribing metrics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40907705/,10.1016/j.ajic.2025.08.017

To evaluate the association of postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis with postoperative rates of surgical site infections, reoperation, and readmission in children undergoing pectus excavatum repair who did and did not receive postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. This cohort study included children aged younger than 18 years undergoing pectus excavatum repair from January 2021 to December 2023 at 141 hospitals participating in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric. Continuation of prophylactic antibiotics after incision closure. Primary outcomes included 30-day postoperative rates of surgical site infections (SSIs), reoperation, and readmission. Propensity score matching was used to balance groups (without PAP or with PAP) on patient and operative characteristics plausibly associated with PAP use and outcomes. Mixed-effects models were used to compare outcomes between matched groups, with a random effect used to account for hospital clustering. A complementary hospital-level analysis was used to explore the correlation between rates of PAP use and observed to expected (O/E) rate ratios for each outcome after adjusting for differences in patient and procedural characteristics among hospitals. A total of 3552 patients were included (median [IQR] age, 15.4 [14.5-16.4] years; 3099 males [87.3%]). Postoperative prophylaxis was used in 1949 patients (54.9%) for a median (IQR) duration of 21.6 (14.6-24.0) hours. In the matched cohort of 3168 patients, outcomes were similar in children receiving PAP compared with those who did not, with 26 of 1584 (1.6%) of children who received PAP developing an SSI compared with 29 of 1584 (1.8%) of children who did not receive PAP (odds ratio [OR], 0.90; 95% CI, 0.50-1.61). For children requiring reoperation, 25 of 1584 (1.6%) received PAP compared with 27 of 1584 (1.7%) who did not (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.52-1.83).

40904573,Cooking for disability: a pilot study on nutritional interventions for mental health support in adults with autism spectrum disorder.,"Blom JMC, Ruggerini C, Caroli F, Ferreri C, Masi A, Rivi V, Sarti P, Rebecchi M, Arletti C",2025,Frontiers in psychiatry,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition often accompanied by chronic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction, which are increasingly recognized as key contributors to symptom severity and behavioral challenges. Despite these insights, targeted nutritional interventions in adults with severe ASD remain understudied. This pilot study investigated whether a precision, biomarker-guided dietary intervention could improve both behavioral symptoms and underlying biological dysregulations in adults with Level 3 ASD. Seven adults with severe ASD residing at the ASP Charitas residential facility in Modena (Italy) participated in a 12-month dietary intervention aimed at reducing inflammation, optimizing fatty acid profiles, and supporting metabolic health. Behavioral assessments-including CARS-2-ST, DASH-II, ABC, and SSP-and biological markers such as IL-6, fecal calprotectin, vitamin D, HbA1c, and erythrocyte lipid profiles were collected at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Baseline assessments confirmed severe ASD symptoms, psychiatric comorbidities, sensory processing abnormalities, systemic and intestinal inflammation, metabolic impairment, and a pro-inflammatory lipid profile. Following the intervention, significant reductions were observed in core autism symptoms (CARS-2-ST, ABC), alongside decreased frequency and severity of behavioral symptoms (DASH-II). Sensory processing (SSP) stabilized or modestly improved. Biochemical markers shifted toward normalization, including increased vitamin D, improved insulin sensitivity (HbA1c), and reduced inflammatory markers (IL-6, fecal calprotectin). Lipidomic profiling revealed elevated anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids (DHA, EPA) and a decreased omega-6/omega-3 ratio. Correlational analyses linked these biological changes to behavioral improvements, suggesting a mechanistic connection. This pilot study suggests that a targeted dietary intervention, based on biological markers reflective of neurobiological dysfunctions, may offer a promising complementary approach to managing ASD symptoms in adults. The findings indicate that dietary modifications can lead to improvements in both biological and behavioral markers, but further research is needed to refine personalized nutritional strategies for individuals with ASD.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40904573/,10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1608033 10.1080/09540261.2018.1450229 10.1016/j.jaac.2013.05.006 10.4102/sajpsychiatry.v29i0.2079 10.1007/s40489-023-00414-1 10.1016/j.rasd.2014.05.003 10.11622/smedj.2021057 10.1186/s12916-024-03814-0 10.1016/j.bpsc.2017.06.008 10.1038/s41390-021-01465-y 10.5498/wjp.v13.i6.262 10.3945/an.114.007914 10.1002/erv.2920 10.1111/obr.13123 10.1124/pharmrev.120.000043 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2019.10.011 10.5409/wjcp.v13.i4.99649 10.3389/fnut.2023.1298469 10.2147/NDT.S84585 10.1007/s10803-020-04627-9 10.3390/nu15234852 10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1071181 10.3390/biomedicines11092488 10.3389/fphar.2024.1398381 10.1038/s41598-017-10361-7 10.1007/s13668-024-00520-4 10.1186/1471-2288-10-1 10.1007/s10803-007-0517-7 10.1177/0300060520952655 10.5114/pg.2021.111420 10.1038/s41398-021-01345-3 10.1101/cshperspect.a016295 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2014.10.011 10.3390/ijms25147809 10.1002/ddrr.1137 10.1016/j.nutos.2023.10.004 10.1186/s12955-020-01284-5 10.3390/medicina57090893 10.1155/2021/8848161 10.3390/cells12040561 10.1212/WNL.0000000000000080 10.1371/journal.pone.0066418 10.1016/j.plefa.2009.05.020 10.3390/nu13072421 10.1194/jlr.R120000800 10.1146/annurev-nutr-082018-124539 10.1038/nrn3820 10.1016/j.plefa.2023.102602 10.3390/biom13050730 10.3390/nu12113446 10.3390/ijms18040708 10.1002/aur.3309 10.5765/jkacap.220027 10.1016/j.xcrm.2024.101916 10.1007/s10803-018-3678-7 10.1192/bjp.159.3.404 10.1007/s11136-014-0759-8 10.1007/s10803-009-0926-x 10.3390/ijms21176042 10.1186/s12916-017-0791-y 10.1080/19490976.2023.2297864 10.1002/mnfr.202100976 10.3233/RNN-230150 10.3390/nu11081813 10.3390/nu14132660 10.3389/fmed.2023.1250247 10.3389/fphar.2025.1570899 10.3390/healthcare10101829 10.2165/11591700-000000000-00000 10.14440/jbm.2025.0094 10.1038/s41598-021-87455-w 10.1016/j.plipres.2021.101144 10.1097/WNN.0000000000000201 10.1007/s10803-016-2860-z 10.3390/ph11020056 10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.09091379 10.1002/mco2.363 10.3389/fnhum.2017.00316 10.1016/j.nbd.2025.106952 10.3390/molecules27051677 10.1186/s12944-025-02563-0 10.1016/j.bpc.2022.106794 10.1098/rsob.200306 10.1017/S1461145713001399 10.1016/j.abb.2023.109555 10.3389/fncel.2023.1163764 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.4350 10.1038/s41398-019-0578-3 10.1038/s41537-024-00542-5 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.109945 10.1038/s41380-023-01948-w 10.1016/j.ebiom.2024.105455 10.1038/s41591-023-02271-1 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.12.004 10.3389/feduc.2024.1453156 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.905273 10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1356331 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1450455 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1355942 10.3389/fmed.2024.1355473 10.1017/s0954579421000651 10.1159/000501797 10.1016/j.plipres.2022.101165

Appropriate antimicrobial use is the cornerstone for curbing antimicrobial resistance and achieving good clinical and economic outcomes. The issues of appropriate antimicrobial use are of critical importance to the global community. To evaluate the current practices of antimicrobial utilization and outcomes in the management of Pneumonia among pediatric patients admitted to the hospital. A prospective observational study design was conducted on children admitted to the pediatric wards of the hospital. The study was conducted from 3 February 2022 to 3 June 2022, and patients aged <18 years and diagnosed with pneumonia were included. A chart review supplemented by a self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regressions were performed for data analyses. Among the total of 146 patients, 61.6% were male, and the mean age was 40.95 (+47.61) months. Treatment approaches in all were empirical and no de-escalation therapy was made even after culture results. Ceftriaxone was the most commonly prescribed antimicrobial. Patients' outcomes included a clinical cure rate of 65.1%, an in-hospital mortality rate of 7.5%, and a complication rate of 27.3%. Poor clinical outcome was associated with recent antimicrobial use (AOR = 3.87; 95% CI:1.34-11.16;  Antimicrobials were prescribed empirically without sufficient evidence of indication such as microbiological and radiologic findings. The practice also is not based on local guidelines and has no multidisciplinary approach in management. These factors likely contributed to higher rates of poor outcomes (more than one-fourth of the patients) when compared with similar studies in other countries. Therefore, these observations need the hospital's establishment of an antimicrobial stewardship program centered on fundamental strategies in pediatrics, including preauthorization, prospective audits with feedback, and pharmacist-led interventions that are feasible and accepted in the inpatient setting as soon as possible.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40901152/,10.1097/MS9.0000000000003690

Misdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary hospitalization, antibiotic use, or surgical intervention. Advances in imaging have improved the recognition of this self-limiting condition, but clinical awareness remains critical. To provide a comprehensive update on the epidemiology, anatomy, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnostic strategies, differential diagnosis, and management of epiploic appendagitis, emphasizing its distinguishing features from other causes of acute abdomen. A review of the literature was conducted, focusing on the clinical characteristics, imaging findings, differential diagnoses, and evidence-based management strategies for epiploic appendagitis. Epiploic appendagitis typically presents with acute, localized, non-radiating abdominal pain without significant systemic symptoms. Diagnosis is heavily reliant on imaging, with computed tomography (CT) being the gold standard. Hallmark CT findings include a small, fat-density ovoid lesion adjacent to the colon, with the usual characteristic ring and dot signs. Differential diagnoses include mainly diverticulitis, appendicitis, omental infarction, and many other causes. Management is predominantly conservative with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and observation, reserving surgical intervention for rare, complicated cases. Recognizing the clinical and imaging features of epiploic appendagitis is essential to avoid unnecessary interventions. Increased clinician awareness, coupled with judicious use of imaging, facilitates timely diagnosis and appropriate management, ensuring optimal patient outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40900773/,10.3748/wjg.v31.i32.109897
40896173,From prescribing indicators to rational drug use: a medication safety perspective.,"Anwar MF, Daud NAA, Hussain R",2025,Journal of pharmaceutical policy and practice,"Over the past few decades, the emergence of irrational medicine use has become a significant global health challenge. It has contributed to medication errors, adverse drug reactions, higher treatment costs, increased morbidity, and mortality. Problems with irrational prescribing are a matter of concern in low and middle-income countries, where regulatory control is underdeveloped, healthcare systems are constrained by economic pressures, and there is a shortage of trained personnel. The World Health Organization (WHO) developed core prescribing indicators to assess and promote rational medication use for healthcare settings. These include indicators measuring polypharmacy, antibiotic use, injectable use, generic prescribing, and adherence to essential medicine lists. This narrative commentary explores the potential of WHO prescribing indicators in promoting the rational use of medicines, highlighting their role in patient safety and supporting evidence-based prescribing practices. The five key areas of these indicators provide valuable insights into prescribing practices in healthcare settings of low and middle-income countries. These indicators also support the WHO's initiative of Medication without Harm. Despite their potential strengths, there are some potential limitations, such as failing to capture the data behind the prescribing practices of prescribers and their utility in specialised healthcare settings. The future of rational prescribing lies in adapting these tools through qualitative assessments, comprehensive data collection methods that include qualitative study design approaches, and targeted training interventions to ensure safe, effective, and equitable medication practices across healthcare systems globally.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40896173/,10.1080/20523211.2025.2544656 10.1177/00469580251347136 10.2174/157488607779315408 10.2471/BLT.22.288293 10.1186/s13756-021-00957-0 10.47890/IJPSCP/ZahraHassanALQamariat/2021/24148307 10.1186/s13756-019-0620-5 10.1016/j.jgo.2020.12.007 10.1136/archdischild-2013-304559 10.1016/S2666-7568(23)00036-3 10.47141/geriatrik.1506076 10.1111/bcp.12954 10.2147/DHPS.S328824 10.1016/j.hlpt.2021.100547 10.1186/s13756-024-01490-6 10.1586/ecp.11.14 10.1787/9a933261-en 10.1007/s00228-013-1575-8 10.1111/bcp.14391 10.1093/jacamr/dlab049 10.1016/j.amepre.2021.04.017 10.3389/fphar.2022.787113 10.20959/wjpr20215-20413 10.1111/bcp.15165 10.1177/20503121211025146 10.5812/ijpbs.10242 10.1017/ash.2023.164 10.4103/mjdrdypu.mjdrdypu_640_22 10.1007/s11096-023-01626-5 10.1186/s12889-025-21553-6 10.4103/0976-500X.179352 10.3390/pharmacy4040035 10.1136/bmjpo-2022-001585 10.1371/journal.pone.0101171 10.1136/archdischild-2015-308428 10.37022/jcscr.v3i3.636 10.3390/antibiotics9080497 10.1371/journal.pone.0210794 10.1186/s40545-021-00313-y 10.1111/bcp.12087 10.1186/s12911-021-01530-w 10.1016/j.cegh.2024.101815

This study examines breastfeeding practices and determinants of EBF among long-standing Palestinian refugees in Jordan through a cross-sectional survey of 249 mothers at the UNRWA Zarqa Camp Health Center. The prevalence of EBF among infants under 6 months was 38.2%, declining with age. Key predictors included birth order, mode of delivery, labor analgesia, and breastfeeding initiation timing. Mothers who delivered vaginally avoided analgesia, and initiated breastfeeding within the first hour had significantly higher EBF rates. Perceived insufficient milk supply was the primary reason for formula introduction. Breastfed infants experienced fewer acute illnesses, antibiotic use, and allergic conditions. Despite moderately positive maternal attitudes toward breastfeeding, fewer than half of the mothers received breastfeeding education, with no significant association between maternal knowledge and feeding methods. These findings underscore the need for interventions promoting early breastfeeding initiation, reducing unnecessary cesarean sections and analgesia, and strengthening breastfeeding education to improve EBF rates and infant health in refugee settings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40893201/,10.3389/fpubh.2025.1644659 10.1016/j.jand.2014.12.014 10.1542/peds.2022-057988 10.1016/j.jped.2013.03.012 10.1016/j.nutos.2023.08.003 10.1186/s13006-020-00326-4 10.1186/s43054-021-00061-3 10.1016/S0140-6736(15)01024-7 10.1007/s10995-015-1805-z 10.1186/s13006-015-0044-7 10.4103/0019-557X.146292 10.1111/birt.12184 10.1093/bmb/ldad027 10.1016/S0140-6736(15)01044-2 10.1016/S0140-6736(19)30637-3 10.1016/S2352-4642(21)00163-2 10.1111/mcn.13097 10.1186/s13006-016-0098-1 10.1016/j.whi.2006.08.001 10.1186/s12884-023-05382-2 10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.07.055 10.1136/bmj.38978.699583.55 10.1080/14034940310019218 10.1016/j.midw.2016.07.011 10.1007/s10995-011-0866-x 10.1016/j.appet.2015.04.078 10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e30687 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025179 10.1213/ANE.0000000000003442 10.1080/00016340701217913 10.1111/j.1523-536X.2010.00421.x 10.1111/j.1740-8709.2007.00096.x 10.1186/s12884-016-0876-1 10.1016/j.midw.2021.103117 10.1111/1471-0528.16666 10.1080/14767058.2019.1587407 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31002-4 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2002.tb02824.x 10.1186/s12887-022-03455-3 10.1186/1471-2458-13-S3-S19 10.3345/cep.2021.00129 10.1186/s13006-019-0207-z 10.1186/1471-2458-11-S3-S15 10.1002/14651858.CD001141.pub4

This study included adult patients presenting to outpatient clinics ( The intervention consisted of an antibiotic order-set and awareness campaign. Patient encounters were identified via CABP ICD-10 codes and IDSA-relevant patient comorbidities (chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease; diabetes mellitus; alcoholism; malignancy; asplenia) were extracted from the electronic health record. Primary outcome was to describe the proportion of patients receiving concordant therapy per IDSA guideline and local antibiogram in a pre- (May 2023 - April 2024) and post-intervention period (May 2024 - December 2024). Baseline and intervention antibiotic concordance rate was 33.3% (1,467/4,401 encounters) and 28.0% (1,388/4,954 encounters), respectively. Among patients with no comorbidity, monotherapy prescriptions (concordant and discordant) decreased post-intervention and were replaced by higher levels of combination therapy (15% increase), albeit all discordant due to lack of comorbidities. Among patients with comorbidities, combination antibiotics increased by 12% post-intervention, driven by concordant prescriptions including amoxicillin/clavulanate plus azithromycin while the most frequently prescribed discordant combination was amoxicillin plus azithromycin. Trends were similar in primary care and urgent care centers.

The implementation of AMS in Kosovo is shaped by economic, social, technological and legal factors. However, it is the structural weaknesses within the health system that pose the most significant barriers. This study will examine the barriers and enablers for AMS programmes for URTIs in the primary care setting.

Penicillins and other beta-lactams are widely used in pregnancy but are often avoided in these patients, resulting in suboptimal therapy, antimicrobial resistance, higher costs, and increased morbidity for patients and neonates. True penicillin allergy is rare, and 95% of unverified penicillin allergies are delabeled upon evaluation. Although penicillin allergy evaluation is safe and recommended for pregnant patients, few patients are assessed. Research concerning antenatal penicillin allergy evaluation is accelerating, and we undertook a systematic review to summarize this growing body of evidence for obstetrical providers. A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed (ahead-of-print and non-Medline records), and ClinicalTrials.gov was conducted in collaboration with a medical information specialist. There were no restrictions on study language, date, or design. All peer-reviewed studies of pregnant people reporting an unverified penicillin allergy and undergoing penicillin allergy evaluation with ≥5 participants were included. Case reports, non-peer-reviewed sources, and studies regarding desensitization of verified penicillin-allergic patients were excluded. Title/abstract review, full-text review, and data extraction were completed independently by 2 authors. Conflicts were resolved by a third author. Studies were evaluated using validated quality assessment tools. Nineteen studies (N=2085) were eligible for inclusion. In total, 1956 (93.81%) participants were delabeled through various approaches: direct oral challenge (18.61%), penicillin skin test and oral challenge (51.12%), penicillin skin test and intravenous challenge (2.97%), penicillin skin test alone (18.00%), history review (1.94%), and unspecified methods (7.41%). Acceptance of penicillin allergy evaluation was 60.88%. Overall, 17 mild and 8 mild delayed allergy-related adverse reactions occurred, requiring minimal intervention. There were 3 severe allergy-related adverse reactions: 2 participants experienced anaphylaxis (managed with intramuscular epinephrine and observation), and 1 patient had mild drug-induced hepatitis (resolved with observation). No hospital transfers were required. No adverse antenatal events were recorded. Penicillin allergy evaluation in pregnancy is safe, effective, and acceptable to patients.

The RedAres randomized controlled trial has shown to reduce second-line antibiotic use for urinary tract infections through a multimodal intervention. It included guideline recommendations for general practitioners and patients (1), provision of regional data for antibiotic resistance (2), delivering personalized feedback based on the proportion of first- and second-line antibiotic prescriptions (3), and benchmarking with regional or supra-regional practices (4). To discuss all interventions, individual telephone counselling was offered. The aim of the RedAres process evaluation is to assess the acceptability of the multimodal intervention among general practitioners and the feasibility of the study design for medical practice assistants. The general practitioners and medical practice assistants surveys were conducted following the RedAres intervention during the last trial visit. To assess acceptability among general practitioners, we developed a questionnaire based on Sekhon´s theoretical framework of acceptability. The questionnaires for medical practice assistants included questions on data management feasibility and attitudes towards this task. Data were analyzed using SPSS and R. Cases were weighted according to the number of respondents per practice, descriptive statistics, chi-squared tests, bivariable logistic regressions, and multivariable logistic regressions were used for data analysis. The response rate to the questionnaires was 96.6% for general practitioners ( The RedAres intervention was favorably received by general practitioners, medical practice assistants deemed data management and extraction feasible. With the backdrop of the intervention’s effectiveness, its favorable reception, and its practicability, antibiotic stewardship and quality control measures implemented at the practice level hold promise for effectively enhancing guideline adherence and improving antibiotic stewardship practices in real-world settings.

40886213,Why internists should care about Helicobacter pylori: recapitulating gastric cancer prevention.,"Di Ciaula A, Khalil M, Fiorini G, Vaira D, Portincasa P",2025,Internal and emergency medicine,"Infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a leading but also modifiable cause of gastric cancer. However, evidence indicates that the goal of a primary prevention of gastric cancer is still far from being achieved. Main obstacles derive from inadequate screening and management of H. pylori infection but also from other external risk factors, responsible for about a quarter of future cases of gastric cancer. The need for population-based H. pylori screen-and-treat programs remains not fully addressed, mainly due to concerns about cost, to underpowered screening efficacy of policies only targeting symptomatic people, to the lack of screen-and-treat approach performed early. Further concerns derive from persisting gaps between guideline-recommended H. pylori management and real-world patterns, leading to inappropriate therapies and increased antimicrobial resistance. A critical role is also played by unhealthy lifestyle and by environmental factors other than H. pylori. In fact, critical external factors increasing the risk of gastric cancer originate from the contamination of environmental matrices and of the food chain with toxic chemicals of anthropogenic origin. An effective strategy for the primary prevention of gastric cancer should therefore consider a full implementation of population-based screen-and-treat programs, but also educational strategies oriented to correct unhealthy habits, and rules and policies oriented to decrease the involuntary exposure to toxic chemicals. In the absence of this comprehensive approach and urgent and efficient prevention policies, local health systems should be prepared to manage the high cost deriving from the growing burden of a preventable (but not prevented) disease, as is gastric cancer.

Recent studies demonstrate the safety of PA delabeling in pediatric primary care. We aimed to identify primary care practitioners' attitudes towards PA delabeling, and perceived barriers and enablers to PA delabeling. We conducted semi structured interviews (n=11) and focus groups (n=3) with 29 primary care practitioners of two health systems in the northeast United States. We coded transcripts using content analysis and mapped barriers and enablers to the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation COM-B model of behavior. Participants perceived PA delabeling to benefit children and shared prior attempts to delabel PAs in primary care. Barriers to PA delabeling included a lack of skills and training to delabel (capability), perceived caregiver resistance to delabel, inadequate time, staff, and space to delabel (opportunity), which led to mixed desires among practitioners to delabel (motivation). To enable PA delabeling in primary care, participants recommended partnership with allergists to implement a delabeling protocol, tools to engage caregivers in delabeling, innovative workflows and infrastructures to facilitate delabeling, and an amplification of reasons for delabeling to occur in pediatric primary care. Primary care practitioners perceived PA delabeling as beneficial to children's health, and specified intervention targets (enablers) to facilitate delabeling. To propel PA delabeling in pediatric primary care, interventions are needed to optimize practitioner skills, secure caregiver interest, and ensure the necessary resources, time, and space for practitioners to delabel.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40885473/,10.1016/j.acap.2025.103139

Current prevention strategies are limited by the absence of individualized risk assessment tools. This study aimed to identify critical perinatal risk factors and to develop a robust, clinically applicable prediction model for RRTI in this vulnerable population. A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital, enrolling 288 preterm infants born between April 2023 and April 2024. Comprehensive maternal, perinatal, and postnatal data were extracted from electronic medical records and supplemented by structured caregiver interviews. A multivariable logistic regression analysis using a stepwise selection method (entry criterion: P < 0.05; exit criterion: P > 0.10) was performed to determine independent predictors of RRTI. The derived model was externally validated in a temporally distinct cohort (n = 100) from the same center. Model performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. Seven independent predictors were retained in the final model: small-for-gestational-age (OR = 3.53, 95% CI: 1.41-11.61), intrauterine infection (OR = 4.22, 95% CI: 1.81-9.83), mechanical ventilation > 72 h (OR = 3.00, 95% CI: 1.27-7.14), prolonged antibiotic use (> 30 days/year; OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.01-5.05), maternal passive smoking (OR = 2.91, 95% CI: 1.19-7.14), history of RSV infection (OR = 5.61, 95% CI: 2.24-14.08), and vaginal delivery as a protective factor (OR = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.08-0.71). The prediction model demonstrated excellent discriminatory performance with an AUC of 0.935 in the training cohort and 0.927 in the validation cohort. Overall accuracy was 75.3% for the training set and 82.0% for the validation set. This study presents a novel risk stratification tool that effectively identifies high-risk moderate-to-late preterm infants and facilitates targeted interventions, such as RSV prophylaxis and enhanced immune monitoring. This advancement enables tailored RSV immunoprophylaxis planning in low-resource Asian NICUs.

This type of educational outreach approach using TARGET (Target Antibiotics Responsibly, Guidance, Education and Tools) antibiotic materials has previously been shown to reduce antibiotic dispensing in a UK primary care setting. The workshop included a review of antibiotic prescribing data, a presentation on paediatric AMS showcasing locally agreed paediatric prescribing guidelines and safety-netting resources from the Healthier Together website, and formulation of a local action plan. The primary outcome measure was total oral antibiotic prescriptions ('items') dispensed per 1000 patients aged under 5 years for the year after the workshop, compared with the previous year's dispensing. The median prescribing rate for children under 5 years of age changed from a baseline of 48.9 per 1000 patients prior to the intervention to a new median monthly prescribing rate of 39.0 per 1000 patients following the intervention.

Effective management of sepsis relies on early recognition and appropriate intervention, underscoring the importance of accurate classification to guide treatment decisions. The correct diagnosis will lead to effective antimicrobial stewardship practices. To assess the distribution of sepsis categories and the use of empirical antibiotics classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) Access, Watch, and Reserve (AWaRe) system in a tertiary care hospital in Northern India and to correlate antibiotic usage with sepsis classifications. This longitudinal observational study in the Department of General Medicine, in a tertiary care hospital in Northern India, from 2023 to 2024, aimed to assess the use of empirical antibiotics classified by the WHO AWaRe system. The study also aimed to correlate antibiotic usage. Patients were categorized into sepsis classes (Asepsis, Possible Sepsis, Probable Sepsis, Confirmed Sepsis) and followed until discharge or Day-28. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were employed to assess sepsis categories and empirical antibiotic usage classified by the WHO AWaRe system. A total of 1867 patients admitted with suspected sepsis were screened, with 230 meeting the inclusion criteria. Among the study cohort (mean age 40.70 ± 14.49 years, 50.9% female), initial sepsis classification predominantly included probable sepsis (51.3%) and possible sepsis (35.7%), evolving to asepsis (57.8%) upon final classification, but all received antibiotics. Empirical antibiotic use showed a predominance of Watch group antibiotics (72.2%), with ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam being the most commonly prescribed; however, no statistical association could be established among the different classes of sepsis with the AWaRe groups. Accurate sepsis classification is pivotal for clinical decision-making, optimizing antibiotic use, and combating antimicrobial resistance. The majority of the asepsis category was labelled as probable or possible sepsis and given antibiotics at initial hospitalization. The high reliance on Watch group antibiotics in empirical therapy signals a need for enhanced diagnostic strategies to refine treatment initiation, potentially reducing unnecessary antibiotic exposure. Future efforts should focus on establishing sepsis classification checklists as in this study and promoting adherence to antimicrobial stewardship principles to mitigate the global threat of antimicrobial resistance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40880558/,10.5492/wjccm.v14.i3.101864

Implications of the proposed new categorization for possible antibiotic usage targets were assessed using England national antibiotic consumption data as a case study. Sixty-one experts across the four UK nations participated in the modified Delphi process. Consensus was most easily reached, with least between-expert variation, for Access antibiotics. Seventeen antibiotics differed in categorization when comparing proposed adapted UK-AWaRe classification and the 2023 WHO AWaRe classification.

(antibiotic residues and ARGs dissemination) as well as public education.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40871267/,10.3390/microorganisms13081763 10.1073/pnas.2411919121 10.3390/w14193138

40868022,"A Comprehensive Review of Antibiotic Resistance in the Oral Microbiota: Mechanisms, Drivers, and Emerging Therapeutic Strategies.","Kulis E, Cvitkovic I, Pavlovic N, Kumric M, Rusic D, Bozic J",2025,"Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)","Recent advances in microbiome research have highlighted the oral cavity as a complex and dynamic ecosystem, home to over 700 microbial species that play critical roles in both oral and systemic health. The oral microbiota not only maintains local tissue homeostasis but also serves as a reservoir for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, contributing to the global spread of resistance. Frequent and sometimes inappropriate antibiotic use in dental practice, along with exposure to antiseptics and biocides, drives the emergence and horizontal transfer of resistance determinants within oral biofilms. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms and ecological drivers of AMR in the oral microbiome, emphasizing the clinical implications of dysbiosis and drug-resistant infections. The authors advocate for the development of dental clinical guidelines tailored to the unique characteristics of the oral microbiota, focusing on personalized therapy through molecular diagnostics, standardized AMR risk assessment, and the integration of non-antibiotic strategies such as probiotics and photodynamic therapy. Continuous education in antimicrobial stewardship and the implementation of oral-specific AMR surveillance is also highlighted as an essential component of effective resistance management. To support rational prescribing, a dedicated mobile application has been developed, leveraging microbiota data and resistance profiles to guide evidence-based, targeted therapy and reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. Collectively, these strategies aim to preserve antibiotic efficacy, ensure patient safety, and promote sustainable infection management in the dental field.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40868022/,10.3390/antibiotics14080828 10.1159/000510979 10.1007/978-3-319-31248-4_4 10.1126/science.288.5464.287 10.1056/NEJM198207083070203 10.3181/00379727-86-21030 10.1007/BF02617382 10.1353/pbm.2002.0064 10.1073/pnas.0407076101 10.1038/sj.embor.7400812 10.1038/nature06245 10.1038/nature06198 10.1038/nature05762 10.1038/nature09646 10.1038/nature11234 10.1038/nature11209 10.1038/nature09199 10.1101/gr.122705.111 10.1038/ismej.2011.169 10.1073/pnas.1300833110 10.1186/s12915-014-0071-7 10.1038/nature12347 10.1073/pnas.1323599111 10.1038/tp.2013.83 10.1038/nature12820 10.1126/science.1241214 10.1038/nature12506 10.1038/nature12171 10.1172/JCI78366 10.1186/s13756-023-01225-z 10.3390/ijerph20116025 10.1128/AEM.00415-15 10.1038/srep43481 10.1111/jam.15492 10.3390/antibiotics12111569 10.1038/s44259-024-00026-7 10.1128/AEM.02766-10 10.3390/nu12040949 10.1093/femsre/fuae017 10.1186/s12864-015-2153-5 10.1007/978-3-030-13035-0_6 10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00199 10.3390/pathogens14020161 10.1016/j.gene.2022.146734 10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.12.071 10.1080/1040841X.2023.2197481 10.1002/cre2.65 10.3390/antibiotics12020293 10.1128/JB.183.18.5385-5394.2001 10.1016/S0924-8579(01)00407-1 10.7717/peerj.18835 10.3390/antibiotics12111584 10.1016/j.jds.2023.07.002 10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_837_21 10.3390/antibiotics13040360 10.7759/cureus.67277 10.1371/journal.pone.0239664 10.1128/mSphere.00162-21 10.3390/ijerph192416448 10.3390/antibiotics10050550 10.12968/denu.2016.43.10.954 10.1016/j.adaj.2018.05.034 10.14219/jada.archive.2000.0181 10.1111/scd.12450 10.1016/j.adaj.2019.08.020 10.18773/austprescr.2017.054 10.1080/00016357.2020.1751273 10.1186/s13063-022-06038-w 10.1371/journal.pone.0188061 10.1016/j.esmoop.2020.04.023 10.1002/jdd.12902 10.1093/jacamr/dlaa096 10.1002/jdd.12445 10.1186/s12909-020-1958-3 10.1093/jacamr/dlac039 10.1111/eje.12758 10.1146/annurev-genom-090711-163814 10.3390/nu14142872 10.1111/omi.12375 10.1016/j.pdpdt.2021.102231 10.1038/s41432-025-01120-z 10.1016/j.mib.2016.06.008 10.3389/fcimb.2021.668632 10.1039/D0NR04540C 10.3390/ijms23063226 10.3390/ijerph192315609 10.1111/odi.14288 10.1038/s41598-018-22687-x 10.3390/antibiotics12010114 10.1111/jcpe.13290 10.3390/pharmaceutics14081621 10.3389/fmicb.2018.01299 10.3389/fmicb.2021.670535 10.3389/fbioe.2024.1427758 10.3389/fcimb.2025.1556688 10.2147/IJN.S279652 10.3389/fcimb.2022.1009415 10.1177/15353702231187645 10.3389/fcimb.2023.1120995 10.1163/18762891-bja00023 10.3390/antibiotics4040567 10.1016/j.joen.2014.12.018 10.1002/JPER.22-0696 10.1073/pnas.1506207112 10.3390/antibiotics13121135

40867991,Ceftazidime-Avibactam in Critically Ill Patients: A Multicenter Observational Study.,"Silvia O, Mazzanti S, Gelo Signorino G, Pallotta F, Ficola A, Canovari B, Di Muzio V, Di Prinzio M, Cerutti E, Donati A, Giacometti A, Barchiesi F, Brescini L",2025,"Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)","Ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI) is a second-generation intravenous β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination. In recent years, substantial evidence has emerged regarding the efficacy and safety of CAZ-AVI. However, data on its use in critically ill patients remain limited. This multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study was conducted across four Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in three hospitals in the Marche region of Italy. The primary objective was to evaluate the 30-day clinical outcomes and identify risk factors associated with 30-day clinical failure-defined as death, microbiological recurrence, or persistence within 30 days after discontinuation of therapy-in critically ill patients treated with CAZ-AVI. The study included all adult critically ill patients admitted to the participating ICUs between January 2020 and September 2023 who received CAZ-AVI for at least 72 h for the treatment of a confirmed or suspected Gram-negative bacterial (GNB) infection. Among the 161 patients included in the study, CAZ-AVI treatment resulted in a positive clinical outcome (i.e., clinical improvement and 30-day survival) in 58% of cases (n = 93/161), while the overall mortality rate was 24% (n = 38/161). Relapse or persistent infection occurred in a substantial proportion of patients (25%, n = 41/161). Notably, acquired resistance to CAZ-AVI was observed in 26% of these cases, likely due to suboptimal use of the drug in relation to its pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties in critically ill patients. Furthermore, treatment failure was more frequent among immunosuppressed individuals, particularly liver transplant recipients. This study demonstrates that the mortality rate among ICU patients treated with this novel antimicrobial combination is consistent with findings from other studies involving heterogeneous populations. However, the rapid emergence of resistance underscores the need for vigilant surveillance and the implementation of robust antimicrobial stewardship strategies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40867991/,10.3390/antibiotics14080797 10.1097/QCO.0000000000000599 10.1001/jama.2016.11764 10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2022.106633 10.3390/antibiotics10121475 10.1016/S1473-3099(18)30605-4 10.1016/S1473-3099(17)30753-3 10.1001/jama.2020.2717 10.3390/antibiotics11050695 10.1093/cid/ciaa773 10.1093/jacamr/dlaa053 10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2022.106536 10.1093/cid/ciy492 10.1007/s40121-021-00506-7 10.1128/AAC.00883-17 10.3390/antibiotics11030321 10.1128/AAC.00449-17 10.1093/cid/ciw636 10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2017.01.018 10.1093/jac/dkaa503 10.1128/spectrum.02647-22 10.1128/AAC.01165-15 10.1093/jac/dky082 10.1128/AAC.02497-17 10.1007/s00134-017-4780-6 10.1016/j.jcrc.2023.154301 10.1128/AAC.02320-19 10.1007/s00134-021-06506-y 10.1007/s00134-018-5197-6 10.3390/antibiotics9070388 10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2019.08.025 10.1093/cid/ciaa1478 10.1016/j.cmi.2021.11.025 10.1093/cid/ciab427 10.1186/s12879-017-2276-1 10.2147/IDR.S342163 10.1111/ctr.13594 10.1016/0021-9681(87)90171-8 10.1111/j.1469-0691.2011.03570.x 10.3390/antibiotics12020399 10.1001/jama.2016.0287 10.1056/NEJMra064928

This study evaluates the impact of the Telementoring, Education, and Advocacy Collaboration initiative for Health through Antimicrobial Stewardship (TEACH AMS), which uses the virtual Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) learning model to enhance AMS capacity in Kenya, Ghana, and Malawi. A mixed-methods approach was used, which included attendance data collection, facility-level assessments, post-session and follow-up surveys, as well as focus group discussions. Between September 2023 and February 2025, 77 virtual learning sessions were conducted, engaging 2445 unique participants from hospital-based AMS committees and health professionals across the three countries. Participants reported significant knowledge gain, and data showed facility improvements in two core AMS areas, including the implementation of multidisciplinary ward-based interventions/communications and enhanced monitoring of antibiotic resistance patterns. Along those lines, participants reported that the program assisted them in improving prescribing and culture-based treatments, and also evidence-informed antibiotic selection. The evidence of implementing ward-based interventions was further stressed in focus group discussions, as well as other strengthened practices like point-prevalence surveys, and development or revision of stewardship policies. Substantial improvements in microbiology services were also shared by participants, particularly in Malawi. Other practices mentioned were strengthened multidisciplinary communication, infection prevention efforts, and education of patients and the community. Our findings suggest that a virtual case-based learning educational intervention, providing structured and tailored AMS capacity building, can drive behavior change and strengthen healthcare systems in low resource settings.

Locally, 50-60% of patients had extended prophylaxis after pacemaker insertion or generator change. Our antimicrobial stewardship programme (ASP) incorporated behavioural change strategies in implementing a multi-pronged intervention bundle to address this and evaluated its effectiveness and safety. This single-centre, retrospective cohort study included patients aged 21 years old or older, undergoing uncomplicated pacemaker insertion or generator change at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) from October 2022 to March 2025. To improve antibiotic use, ASP interventions incorporating behaviour change strategies were implemented, namely (1) data-driven feedback, (2) targeted education, (3) identification and engagement of ASP champion, and (4) clinical pathway revision. There were 779 patients evaluated; 380 (48.8%) received standard prophylaxis while 399 (51.2%) received extended prophylaxis with oral antibiotics (mean duration, 3.3 ± 0.8 days). Following ASP interventions, the practice of extended prophylaxis declined significantly from 43.8% to 24.0% ( The bundled ASP interventions, incorporating behavioural change strategies, have effectively and safely reduced the use of extended prophylaxis post-cardiac device implantation.

40859217,"Association of maternal infections, antibiotic use, and cesarean delivery with the risk of early-onset sepsis: a nationwide population-based study in full-term neonates.","Lee HY, Hsu YL, Lee WY, Ko SH, Huang YL, Chen CL, Lin HJ, Tsai ML, Chang YC, Lin HC",2025,BMC pregnancy and childbirth,"Neonatal sepsis remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among newborns worldwide. Although the implementation of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) has led to changes in the microbiological landscape of early-onset sepsis (EOS), the incidence among full-term neonates has not declined as expected. This underscores the ongoing need to identify and understand maternal and neonatal risk factors to inform more effective prevention strategies. We conducted a nationwide, population-based matched case-control study using data from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2019, encompassing all pregnant individuals and their term infants in Taiwan. The primary objective was to identify clinical risk factors associated with EOS by comparing neonates diagnosed with EOS to matched controls without EOS. Conditional logistic regression was used for statistical analysis, adjusting for relevant maternal and neonatal covariates. A total of 1,694,043 mother-term infant pairs were included in the analysis, representing one of the largest national cohorts to date. Despite the implementation of a universal antenatal screening program and IAP in 2012, the incidence of clinical EOS did not decline over the study period and showed a slight increase around 2018. Adjusted analyses identified several significant risk factors for EOS, including chorioamnionitis (OR 8.99; 95% CI, 3.07-26.33), maternal pneumonia (OR 17.35; 95% CI, 6.85-43.90), Cesarean section (OR 1.45; 95% CI, 1.28-1.64), maternal diabetes mellitus (OR 1.95; 95% CI, 1.52-2.51), maternal antibiotic use during pregnancy (OR 1.33; 95% CI, 1.17-1.52), premature rupture of membranes (PROM) (OR 1.69; 95% CI, 1.32-2.15), birth weight (OR 0.99; 95% CI, 0.99-0.99) (all p < 0.001), and maternal genitourinary tract infections (OR 1.85; 95% CI, 1.22-2.80; p = 0.004). Mortality was notably higher among neonates with EOS (0.667%) compared to those without EOS (0.0926%) (p < 0.001). This study provides the most comprehensive analysis to date of EOS risk in term neonates using a nationwide dataset. Our findings indicate that cesarean delivery, maternal antibiotic use, specific maternal infections, maternal diabetes mellitus, premature rupture of membranes, and lower birth weight are associated with an increased risk of EOS. Further research is warranted to explore the potential causal relationships underlying these associations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40859217/,10.1186/s12884-025-08031-y
40856178,Effects of antibiotic prophylaxis during labour on maternal and neonatal outcomes in women planning vaginal birth.,"Suzuki D, Yamaji N, Nishimura E, Suzuki H, Ishikawa K, Rahman MO, Makama M, Vogel JP, Ota E",2025,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Maternal sepsis is the third leading cause of maternal mortality globally. However, the risk of maternal sepsis can be reduced by administering antibiotics prophylactically before infection occurs. Previous research has assessed the effects of azithromycin prophylaxis during pregnancy, but evidence is lacking on the effects of other types of antibiotics, and the potential for antimicrobial resistance. To assess the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis in women in labour after 28 weeks' gestation on the prevention of maternal and neonatal infections and mortality. We used CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, one other database, and two trial registries, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify eligible studies. We did not restrict the search by publication type or language. The latest search date was 30 July 2024. We included randomised controlled trials involving pregnant women in labour after 28 gestational weeks, comparing any antibiotic prophylaxis with placebo or no treatment. We included trials of women anticipating a vaginal delivery, irrespective of baseline risk factors (unselected, lower-risk, or higher-risk), and without an indication for antibiotic prophylaxis in any care setting. We excluded trials that enroled only women with a planned caesarean section or a known bacterial infection (such as group B Streptococcus), and trials evaluating antibiotics for treatment rather than prevention. Our key outcomes of interest, as presented in the summary of findings table, were: incidence of maternal sepsis, maternal mortality, neonatal sepsis, neonatal mortality, wound infection (perineal), adverse effects of antibiotics, and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission. We used the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2) to assess the risk of bias. We synthesised results for each outcome using random-effects meta-analysis in Review Manager. Meta-analyses were conducted using the inverse-variance method for dichotomous and continuous outcomes. We used a narrative synthesis following the SWiM (Synthesis Without Meta-analysis) reporting guideline for outcomes that could not be pooled statistically due to heterogeneity or limited data. We summarised key findings from individual studies descriptively and structured by outcome domain. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. We included four trials with 42,846 participants (21,501 in the intervention groups versus 21,345 in the control groups). All were individually randomised trials conducted in low- and middle-income countries. Three trials used a single oral dose of azithromycin in the intervention group, while the fourth used a combination of azithromycin and amoxicillin. All four trials used a placebo control. We judged three trials to have an overall low risk of bias, and the remaining trial to be at 'some concerns', due to reporting bias. Below, we report on the key outcomes of interest, as presented in the summary of findings table. Compared to placebo, any antibiotic use: • probably reduces maternal sepsis (1.8% in the placebo group versus 1.2% in the antibiotic group; risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 0.77; I Offering a single oral dose of prophylactic antibiotics to pregnant women in labour after 28 gestational weeks or more probably reduces maternal sepsis. It likely results in little to no difference in maternal mortality, and results in little to no difference in neonatal sepsis, neonatal mortality, perineal wound infection, and NICU admission. Evidence on antimicrobial resistance is very uncertain: short-term increases in resistant organisms were observed in some maternal samples, but no persisting between-group differences were found at 11 to 13 months' follow-up. Implementation should be cautious and accompanied by antimicrobial stewardship and AMR surveillance, and future research should better quantify AMR effects and identify optimal antibiotic strategies.

We conducted a pragmatic clinical trial in children at a public hospital in Guatemala comparing the impact of a multiplex polymerase chain reaction panel to conventional microbiologic methods. The BioFire Blood Culture Identification (BCID2) panel was performed with antimicrobial stewardship advice on positive blood cultures from midnight to 1 pm on weekdays as the intervention. Children with positive cultures outside these times served as the control group. Time-to-optimal antimicrobial therapy was the primary outcome measure. All-cause mortality was a secondary outcome. A total of 246 children were enrolled from April 2022 to October 2022: 135 in the BCID2 and 111 in the control group. The most common pathogens were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (54%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (11%). There was a significant reduction in median time-to-optimal antimicrobial therapy from 97·9 (0-252.3) hours to 31·5 (0-157.1) hours ( P = 0.03) in the control versus BCID2 groups. There was a trend for reduction in overall mortality from 18% (20 deaths) in the control to 10% (14 deaths) in the BCID2 group ( P =0.08).

40873848,A Descriptive Study on Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) in Early Identification of Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP) Among Critically Ill Patients in a Tertiary Care Teaching Hospital.,"Mondal S, Jubilson F, Sinha S",2025,Cureus,"Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), occurs more than 48 hours after hospital admission and is often associated with multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. Prompt and accurate diagnosis is critical, relying on clinical criteria such as fever, leukocytosis, purulent sputum, and new infiltrates on imaging, along with respiratory cultures to identify causative organisms. Empirical antibiotic therapy should be initiated early, targeting likely pathogens, but must be refined through de-escalation once culture results are available. This approach helps reduce the risk of resistance, minimizes unnecessary antibiotic use, and improves patient outcomes in healthcare settings. The research was conducted within a tertiary intensive care unit (ICU), focusing on a cohort of 225 adult patients who were hospitalized for a duration exceeding 48 hours. Participants were selected using a purposive sampling method. Data collection involved observational techniques, utilizing validated assessment instruments that exhibited a strong internal consistency, evidenced by a Cronbach's alpha of 0.829. The data analysis employed Chi-square statistics to investigate associations among the variables studied. This methodological framework ensured robust findings and yielded valuable insights into clinical patterns and outcomes pertinent to patients in critical care environments. A study conducted on ICU patients revealed that a substantial 85.3% exhibited a low Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS), characterized by moderate pyrexia and minimal respiratory secretions. In contrast, 14.7% of patients were classified as high-risk, demonstrating pronounced inflammatory responses and specific radiographic abnormalities. Analysis using Kendall's tau_b established a positive correlation between CPIS scores and the incidence of HAP. Among the cohort of 225 critically ill patients, those identified as high CPIS risk had a significantly elevated occurrence of HAP (p=0.001), underscoring the utility of CPIS as a robust predictive indicator for pneumonia risk in this population. The CPIS serves as an effective prognostic tool for the early identification of HAP in critically ill patients. In a study involving 225 ICU patients, a significant correlation was found between elevated CPIS scores and the development of HAP, highlighting its clinical utility. This correlation underscores the role of CPIS in facilitating timely medical decision-making by supporting early diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Early identification of HAP through CPIS enables prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotic treatment, which is crucial in preventing complications-especially those related to multidrug-resistant organisms commonly encountered in intensive care settings. Moreover, the implementation of CPIS as part of routine patient assessment may contribute to improved patient outcomes, reduced duration of ICU stay, and overall enhancement of infection control measures. As a cost-effective and evidence-based scoring system, CPIS plays a vital role in optimizing care for high-risk, critically ill patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40873848/,10.7759/cureus.88841

National surveillance of HAIs at sentinel acute care hospitals is conducted by the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program. This article describes device and surgical procedure-related HAI epidemiology in Canada from 2019 to 2023. Data were collected from 68 Canadian sentinel acute care hospitals between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2023, for intensive care unit central line-associated bloodstream infections (ICU-CLABSIs), hip and knee surgical site infections (SSIs), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt SSIs and paediatric cardiac SSIs. Case counts, rates, patient and hospital characteristics, pathogen distributions and antimicrobial resistance data are presented. Between 2019 and 2023, 2,582 device-related infections and 1,029 surgical procedure-related infections were reported. Rates of ICU-CLABSIs fluctuated throughout the study period, with an overall increase in all intensive care unit settings except for the neonatal intensive care unit, where a 4% decrease was noted. An increase in SSIs following knee arthroplasty was observed, rising from 0.34 to 0.43 infections per 100 surgeries. Fluctuating trends were also observed in CSF shunt SSIs and paediatric cardiac SSIs over the study period. The most commonly identified pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (23%) in ICU-CLABSIs and  Epidemiological and microbiological trends among selected device and surgical procedure-related HAIs are essential for benchmarking infection rates nationally and internationally, identifying any changes in infection rates or antimicrobial resistance patterns and helping inform hospital infection prevention and control and antimicrobial stewardship policies and programs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40861920/,10.14745/ccdr.v51i67a05 10.1016/j.jiph.2014.04.003 10.1186/s13017-020-0288-4 10.1503/cmaj.190361 10.1097/MD.0000000000031160 10.1016/j.ajic.2021.11.006 10.1016/j.jpeds.2014.02.013 10.1002/phar.2781 10.1017/ice.2024.132 10.1308/rcsann.2019.0064 10.1016/j.wneu.2024.09.107 10.14745/ccdr.v48i78a04 10.1086/593969 10.1016/j.jcjq.2018.05.009 10.14745/ccdr.v50i06a02

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of an Antibiotic Stewardship Program (ASP) on individual clinical outcomes (recovery, recurrence, and treatment adherence) and broader public health indicators (antibiotic resistance trends, hospital admissions, and referrals) in the management of PID across multiple tertiary healthcare centers. This descriptive observational study was conducted at the Departments of Gynecology of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), Islamabad; Shalamar Hospital, Lahore; City Hospital, Multan; Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), Peshawar; and Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC), Peshawar, from August 2022 to July 2024. A total of 390 women aged 15-45 diagnosed with PID were enrolled - 190 prior to and 200 following the implementation of an ASP. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 26, employing descriptive statistics, Chi-square tests for categorical variables, and independent t-tests for continuous variables. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Following the intervention, treatment adherence significantly improved from 108 patients (56.84%) to 169 patients (84.50%) (p < 0.001). The number of patients experiencing symptom recurrence declined from 23 patients (12.11%) to nine patients (4.50%) (p = 0.014), while complete clinical recovery increased from 119 patients (62.63%) to 158 patients (79.00%) (p = 0.002). In addition, hospital admissions due to PID decreased from 73 patients (38.42%) to 49 patients (24.50%) (p = 0.006), and the average treatment duration was reduced from 11.6 days to 9.2 days (p < 0.001). Referrals related to antibiotic resistance also fell from 26 patients (13.68%) to 11 patients (5.50%) (p = 0.009). Although complications declined, the change was not statistically significant (p = 0.318). Implementation of antibiotic stewardship across multiple tertiary care centers significantly improved clinical outcomes, enhanced treatment adherence, and contributed to a reduction in recurrence and resistance-associated referrals in PID management, supporting the value of coordinated antimicrobial policies from both gynecological and public health perspectives.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40861623/,10.7759/cureus.88739
40861595,Disruption and Adaptation of Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs in Iranian Hospitals During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Descriptive Phenomenological Qualitative Study.,"Bijani B, Azizi L, QasemiBarqi R, Allami A",2025,Cureus,"Introduction Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a pressing global health issue, exacerbated by inappropriate antibiotic use. In Iran, the 2016 National Action Plan on AMR established hospital-based antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs), including audit-feedback, prescription restrictions, and guideline-based prescribing to promote rational prescribing. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted these efforts, resulting in increased empirical antibiotic use. This qualitative study, using a descriptive phenomenological approach, explores healthcare providers' perceptions of antibiotic prescribing and ASP implementation in two Iranian teaching hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on context-specific barriers and adaptations. Methods Conducted from May 20, 2022, to January 20, 2023, at two 500-bed teaching hospitals in Qazvin, Iran, this descriptive phenomenological study involved 12 purposively sampled healthcare providers (10 physicians, one clinical pharmacist, one microbiology lab supervisor) until thematic saturation, achieved when no new themes emerged after the 10th interview, as confirmed by codebook review. Semi-structured interviews (45-60 minutes), conducted in Persian in private settings, explored prescribing changes, ASP disruptions, and adaptations. Transcripts were translated into English, anonymized, and analyzed thematically, generating ~150 codes clustered into four themes. Trustworthiness was ensured via triangulation, audit trails, and member checking, with translation accuracy verified by a second bilingual researcher. Ethical approval was granted by the Qazvin University of Medical Sciences Ethics Committee (IR.QUMS.REC.1403.091). Results Four themes emerged from the qualitative analysis, reflecting participant-reported experiences: (1) Increased empirical prescribing - all participants reported diagnostic uncertainty and public pressure driving preemptive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., ceftriaxone, meropenem). (2) Disruption of stewardship programs - most participants (10/12) noted suspended ASP activities (e.g., audits) due to staff redeployment. (3) Systemic and laboratory constraints - all participants highlighted delayed cultures and antibiotic shortages as barriers. (4) Adaptations and lessons learned - most participants (10/12) described late-2021 adaptations like virtual consultations. All findings reflect participant-reported experiences and perceptions, not objectively verified outcomes. Conclusion This qualitative study provides exploratory insights into healthcare providers' perceptions of AMS disruptions in two Qazvin hospitals, with reported increases in empirical prescribing due to uncertainty and resource constraints. Participant-reported adaptations, such as virtual reviews, were noted, though their sustainability remains unevaluated. International comparisons with the UAE, UK, and India highlight shared challenges and the need for context-specific protocols and diagnostics. Findings are limited to participant perceptions and require further validation through mixed-methods research. Policymakers may consider exploratory strategies like virtual tools and public education, pending feasibility studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40861595/,10.7759/cureus.88754

We describe implementation of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) videoconference antimicrobial stewardship team (VAST) to connect multidisciplinary teams from rural VA medical centers (VAMCs) with geographically distant ID experts. We implemented VASTs at 10 rural VAMCs from September 2021 to February 2024. VASTs consisted of regular meetings between rural VAMCs and an off-site ID expert who met by videoconference to discuss clinical cases, emphasizing recommendations for antibiotic prescribing. The VA Corporate Data Warehouse was used to collect information on patient medical encounter information. Interviews with healthcare professionals and surveys assessed perceptions of and experiences with VASTs. VASTs completed 624 clinical encounters on 531 unique patients. Half (53%) of the encounters required >20 minutes. The most frequently discussed infections were respiratory tract (35%), skin and soft tissue (19%), and genitourinary (17%). Of the 73 (53% of 138 contacted) professionals who responded to the survey, >90% perceived VASTs as improving the quality of veteran care and agreed that recommendations were timely. All 24 interviewees identified VASTs as meeting an important need at the rural site and that the virtual system facilitated collaboration. These findings indicate successful implementation of a telehealth program to disseminate ID and antimicrobial stewardship expertise to rural VAMCs.

However, the primary pathogenic determinants underlying TEC impairment and disease advancement in DKD progression remain unclear. This study reveals that asprosin (ASP) is up-regulated and positively correlated with kidney dysfunction in DKD mice. Moreover, elevated ASP is mainly located in the renal TEC, and negatively impacts TEC. In addition, supraphysiological ASP concentration impairs mitochondrial dynamics and function in both DKD mice and HK2 cells. Mechanistically, ASP promotes Drp1 over-SUMOylation, thus reducing Drp1 degradation and disrupting mitochondrial dynamics homeostasis. However, the mutation of Drp1-SUMOylation modification sites alleviates the mitochondrial dynamics disorder, TEC injury, and phenotypic transformation induced by ASP. Also, it is further elucidated that such a regulatory effect of ASP on the Drp1-SUMOylation modification is fulfilled by modulating PIAS1 or SENP1 (a de-SUMOylation protease).

40859782,Diabetes Mellitus and Infectious Diseases: Current Evidence and Clinical Implications.,"Kim T, Choi SH",2025,Diabetes & metabolism journal,"Diabetes mellitus predisposes individuals to a broad spectrum of infections. People with diabetes face a 1.5- to 4-fold increased risk of both common and severe infections, and infections remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Chronic hyperglycemia impairs neutrophil chemotaxis, oxidative burst, and complement activation, while vascular insufficiency and neuropathy compromise tissue perfusion and barrier integrity. These defects, together with altered skin, mucosal, and gut microbiota, influence the marked susceptibility to urinary tract infections (especially renal abscess and emphysematous pyelonephritis), osteomyelitis, diabetic foot infections, pneumonia (including influenza), tuberculosis, skin and soft tissue infections, and lifethreatening syndromes such as emphysematous cholecystitis and rhino-orbital mucormycosis that are almost exclusive to people with diabetes. Outcomes from infections are worse in diabetes. Although the core therapeutic principles align with those for patients without diabetes, management should be individualized. Glycemic control should balance infection risk and hypoglycemia; antimicrobial dosing should account for renal function and drug interactions; and strict antimicrobial stewardship is required. If needed, prompt debridement and multidisciplinary intervention are necessary to mitigate complications and reduce mortality. Preventive care relies on comprehensive vaccination (influenza, pneumococcus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2], hepatitis B, herpes zoster, and Tdap/Td) and regular foot surveillance with offloading to avert ulceration.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40859782/,10.4093/dmj.2025.0508

Among the 90 patients analyzed, 86 (96%) received PEG-ASP at least in one of the first two courses (C1-C2) of chemotherapy and were evaluated for toxicity and outcome. In detail, 51 patients received PEG-ASP in both courses and 35 in either C1 or C2. The most common adverse event was hepatic toxicity (HT), with 38% of patients experiencing any grade of HT at C1 (HT grade ≥ 3, 19%) and 23% at C2 (HT grade ≥ 3, 9%). Additionally, HT at C1 was the primary reason for withholding PEG-ASP at C2. Coagulopathy was the second most frequent toxicity (any grade of toxicity in 26% of patients at C1 and in 20% at C2). No deaths directly related to PEG-ASP therapy were reported. The CR rate after C1 and C3 was 94% and 93%, respectively. MRD negativity rate was 40% and 68%, respectively. The OS and DFS probability at 3 years was 54% and 47%, respectively. PEG-ASP administration in older ALL patients is feasible, but HT is a concern, being the major cause of PEG-ASP interruption. Therefore, a dose adjustment, according to age and concomitant comorbidities, is advisable to balance PEG-ASP efficacy with its toxicity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40858769/,10.1007/s00277-025-06550-4 10.3324/haematol.2024.286744

Notably, the dosage and duration of antibiotic use for specific infections may exert detrimental effects on microbiota in non-infected sites. Here, we propose a dual-channel probiotic delivery strategy to address gut and vaginal dysbiosis caused by antibiotic therapies. In a Helicobacter pylori infection model, oral administration of Limosilactobacillus reuteri NCU-15 alleviated gastritis and protected the intestinal barrier and microbiota. In a vaginal dysbiosis model, intravaginal delivery of Lactobacillus crispatus NCU-23 reduced local inflammation and apoptosis, restoring vaginal microbial homeostasis. In the entero-vaginal disordered mice, dual-channel probiotic therapy produced synergistic effects by reducing inflammation, inhibiting apoptosis, and reestablishing microbial balance. These findings demonstrate the potential of dual-channel probiotic intervention to modulate gut-vaginal microbiota interactions and offer a scientific basis for developing strategies to prevent or treat antibiotic-induced dysbiosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40855059/,10.1038/s41522-025-00813-8

To address this gap, a user-friendly, dynamic online nomogram was developed to predict the incidence of positive urine cultures in patients with urolithiasis. A retrospective study was conducted with 3,641 patients with urinary stones at the Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University. The cohort was split into training and validation sets. Key variables were identified using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, while Random Forest and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) methods were applied to assess their importance. Online nomograms were developed and evaluated for performance through metrics such as area under the curve (AUC), calibration curve, decision curve analysis (DCA), probability density function (PDF), and clinical utility curve (CUC). Multivariate logistic analysis identified four significant predictors-bacteria (BACT), C-reactive protein (CRP), nitrite, and leukocyte esterase (LEU)-which were integrated into the nomogram. The AUC values for the overall, training, and validation sets were 90.53, 91.22, and 89.06%, respectively. Calibration curves confirmed the nomogram's accuracy, and DCA demonstrated its superior performance over individual metrics. The PDF/CUC method revealed a threshold of 0.168, which effectively distinguished 88.54% of negatives from 78.70% of positives. This dynamic online nomogram accurately predicts positive urine cultures in patients with urolithiasis, helping clinicians identify high-risk individuals , optimize antibiotic use, and improve patient outcomes. Further validation and biomarker exploration are needed to enhance its generalizability.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40853723/,10.1080/07853890.2025.2550582 10.1007/s00240-024-01601-3 10.1007/s00345-024-05229-1 10.1016/j.euf.2021.02.014 10.1093/ndt/gfad233 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1181688 10.1001/jamainternmed.2024.5333 10.1089/end.2020.0163 10.1007/s00345-023-04676-6 10.1007/s00240-022-01323-4 10.3389/fonc.2022.829761 10.1016/j.clnu.2021.08.024 10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2024.104716 10.1002/acn3.51888 10.1007/s00259-020-05128-8 10.1186/s13104-016-2028-0 10.1007/s00467-023-06173-9 10.1186/s12879-023-08711-0 10.1093/cid/ciae230 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2024.11.010 10.1186/s12911-024-02819-2 10.1016/s0302-2838(03)00041-1 10.1186/s12894-018-0359-y 10.1089/sur.2022.290 10.3389/fped.2023.1201368 10.1007/s00467-024-06321-9 10.23876/j.krcp.22.289 10.1038/s41574-018-0059-4 10.1371/journal.pone.0268243 10.1371/journal.ppat.1011926 10.1038/s41590-023-01588-w 10.1177/09636897241236584 10.1016/j.ejphar.2024.177154 10.1111/dom.16066 10.1097/01.ju.0000154350.78826.96 10.14715/cmb/2021.67.4.23

Current diagnostic practices often require 24-48 h due to the time needed for culture results. Given that 70%-80% of cultures return negative, there is significant interest in rapidly identifying negative samples to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. This study aimed to develop and evaluate 6 machine learning models to predict UTIs. Urine samples from 22 961 patients, collected between September 28, 2023 and June 29, 2024, were analyzed. Six machine learning models were assessed for their ability to predict UTIs based on 5 definitions incorporating pyuria and culture outcomes. The dataset was randomly divided into a training set (70%, n = 16 072) and an independent test set (30%, n = 6889). Seventeen predictive parameters, including dipstick reflectance results and demographic variables, were evaluated. The CatBoost Classifier emerged as the best-performing model, achieving an area under the ROC curve of 92.0%-94.7% depending on the UTI definition, with a negative predictive value consistently exceeding 95%, and an average precision ranging from 68.2% to 81.6%. In comparison, the predictive performance of nitrite and/or leukocyte esterase was significantly lower. Machine learning models, particularly the CatBoost Classifier, demonstrate high accuracy and offer a promising tool to aid clinicians in UTI diagnosis. Unlike traditional culture methods, these models deliver results within an hour. Further external validation with an independent dataset and prospective studies assessing the impact on antibiotic prescribing practices is recommended.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40856092/,10.1093/clinchem/hvaf088

This study evaluated the impact of enhanced IPC and AMS on CDI and bloodstream infections (BSIs) caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (3GCREB). The study was conducted in five German university hospitals from January 2016 to July 2019. IPC and AMS interventions were sequentially enhanced in three departments with high-incidence CDI at baseline using a stepped-wedge cluster intervention approach. Main outcome measures were incidence densities of CDI and BSI caused by VRE and 3GCREB. An interrupted time series analysis was performed to assess the intervention effects during a normalized study period. Across 15 departments, >384,000 patient days were included. Incidence density of target infections was low (CDI, 0.77; VRE BSI, 0.07; and 3GCREB BSI, 0.09 per 1000 patient days). Pooled interrupted time series analysis results showed a significant reduction in CDI incidence density following the enhancement of AMS measures (AMS period regression slopes difference, -0.089; F[p] = 5.400 [0.037]). Regarding the incidence density of VRE/3GCREB BSI, no relevant changes could be observed (regression slopes difference, -0.19; F[p] = 0.667 [0.429]). A subgroup analysis focusing on haematological and oncological departments showed that AMS influenced prescription behaviour according to implemented AMS strategies, but not clinical outcomes. Combined with IPC enhanced short-term AMS measures led to a significant reduction in the incidence of CDI, whereas the incidence of BSI by VRE and 3GCREB remained unchanged in sites with well-established baseline IPC and AMS programmes and low incidence of hospital-associated infections.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40854464/,10.1016/j.cmi.2025.08.013

Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has emerged as a complementary diagnostic tool capable of identifying fastidious, unexpected, or novel pathogens without prior assumptions. This narrative review synthesizes evidence from 152 studies (2015-2024), evaluating mNGS within existing diagnostic frameworks for culture-negative IE. Compared to conventional diagnostics (blood cultures, PCR, 16 S rRNA sequencing), mNGS demonstrates enhanced detection capabilities for polymicrobial infections and rare pathogens, though methodological heterogeneity across studies precludes definitive performance comparisons. Performance varies substantially based on sample type, sequencing platform, and bioinformatic pipelines. Real-world applications reveal persistent challenges, including cost barriers, interpretive complexities in low-biomass samples, and contamination risks. Integration with host-response biomarkers and AI-driven interpretation platforms shows promise for advancing clinical utility. For mNGS to be effectively integrated into routine CNE care, standardization, regulatory clarity, and equitable implementation will be essential.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40847264/,10.1007/s44197-025-00455-1
40852663,Antibiotic stewardship and antimicrobial resistance in conflict-affected Sudan: a situational analysis.,"Fletcher M, Trueba M, Al-Hassan L",2025,Frontiers in public health,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global concern, the drivers and consequences of which are exacerbated by poverty and inequality, with Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) bearing the highest rates, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa. Armed conflict further exasperates problem, by damaging healthcare systems, limiting access to essential medicines, and increasing the use of antibiotics in uncertain environments. This study sought to explore healthcare professionals' views on AMR and antimicrobial stewardship challenges before and during the conflict to investigate the impact of armed conflict on antimicrobial stewardship (ASP) in Sudan, a low-income country facing a humanitarian crisis exacerbated by ongoing violence. Data was collected via an anonymous qualitative online survey completed by healthcare workers with experience before and during the conflict and was analysed via thematic analysis. Sudan is experiencing significant challenges due to its fragile healthcare system, poverty, and inequality. The results identify barriers to ASPs before and during the conflict, including lack of laboratory facilities, inadequate training, and the indiscriminate use of antibiotics. The findings reveal that the conflict has intensified the risk of AMR, with disrupted healthcare services leading to increased self-medication and reliance on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The study underscores the urgent need for multi-faceted interventions that address immediate healthcare needs while implementing long-term strategies to control AMR in conflict-affected regions. Recommendations include enhancing healthcare infrastructure, improving diagnostic capabilities, and fostering collaborations among various stakeholders to ensure sustainable AMR prevention strategies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40852663/,10.3389/fpubh.2025.1589290 10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02724-0 10.1371/journal.pmed.1004178 10.1016/j.jgar.2022.06.022 10.1016/S2214-109X(23)00554-5 10.1016/j.cmi.2024.03.029 10.2105/AJPH.2012.300693 10.1136/bmjgh-2022-010863 10.21608/mid.2023.204635.1503 10.1016/S0140-6736(23)02508-4 10.1016/j.jiph.2021.04.009 10.1016/j.ajic.2016.03.036 10.3389/fmicb.2020.00068 10.1016/S0140-6736(22)01149-7 10.1186/s13031-024-00581-w 10.1016/s1473-3099(05)70189-4 10.1093/jacamr/dlae049 10.1016/S0140-6736(19)32974-5 10.1016/s2214-109x(23)00539-9 10.1186/s43058-021-00229-3 10.1057/s41599-024-02706-1
40852607,Global variation in antibiotic prescribing guidelines and the implications for decreasing AMR in the future.,"Jamil E, Saleem Z, Godman B, Ullah M, Amir A, Haseeb A, Meyer JC, Qamar MU, Almarzoky Abuhussain SS",2025,Frontiers in pharmacology,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a global burden, with inappropriate antibiotic prescribing being an important contributing factor. Antibiotic prescribing guidelines play an important role in improving the quality of antibiotic use, provided they are evidence-based and regularly updated. As a result, they help reduce AMR, which is a critical challenge in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Consequently, the objective of this study was to evaluate local, national, and international antibiotic prescribing guidelines currently available-especially among LMICs-and previous challenges, in light of the recent publication of the WHO AWaRe book, which provides future direction. Google Scholar and PubMed searches were complemented by searching official country websites to identify antibiotic prescribing guidelines, especially those concerning empiric treatment of bacterial infections, for this narrative review. Data were collected on the country of origin, income level, guideline title, year of publication, development methodology, issuing organization, target population, scope, and coverage. In addition, documentation on implementation strategies, compliance, monitoring of outcome measures, and any associated patient education or counseling efforts were reviewed to assess guideline utilization. A total of 181 guidelines were included, with the majority originating from high-income countries (109, 60.2%), followed by lower-middle-income (40, 22.1%), low-income (18, 9.9%), and upper-middle-income (14, 7.7%) countries. The GRADE methodology was used in only 20.4% of the sourced guidelines, predominantly in high-income countries. Patient education was often underemphasized, particularly in LMICs. The findings highlighted significant disparities in the development, adaptation, and implementation of guidelines across different WHO regions, confirming the previously noted lack of standardization and comprehensiveness in LMICs. Significant disparities exist in the availability, structure, and methodological rigor of antibiotic prescribing guidelines across countries with different income levels.

The BIOFIRE® Joint Infection (JI) Panel, a fully automated multiplex PCR system, enables the identification of 31 organisms and 8 antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes within 1 h, offering a promising diagnostic method. However, its diagnostic performance, particularly in Asian populations, remains underexplored. This retrospective study analyzed 60 cases of suspected PJI between 2022 and 2023. Synovial fluid samples were evaluated using the JI Panel and microbiological culture, with PJI diagnoses based on the International Consensus Meeting 2018 criteria. Diagnostic accuracy, including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV), was assessed by comparing JI Panel results with microbiological culture findings or PJI diagnosis. Among 60 cases, 33 were diagnosed with PJI. The JI Panel demonstrated a sensitivity of 45.5 % and a specificity of 100 % for detecting PJI, while microbiological culture showed a sensitivity of 63.6 % and specificity of 100 %. Combined use of the JI Panel and culture improved diagnostic sensitivity to 69.7 %. Notably, the JI Panel identified pathogens in two culture-negative PJI cases. Limitations of the JI Panel included its inability to detect coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), such as Staphylococcus epidermidis. However, the JI Panel successfully identified Candida species, a pathogen often undetected by conventional methods. The JI Panel facilitates rapid and accurate diagnosis of PJI with high specificity. Although limited by its low sensitivity for CNS-associated infections, the ability to rapidly identify causative organisms and detect fungal pathogens supports its clinical utility. Implementation of the JI Panel in diagnostic laboratories may expedite diagnosis, reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, and alleviate the burden of multidrug-resistant infections. The BIOFIRE® JI Panel offers a highly specific, fully automated method for the rapid diagnosis of PJI. Its adoption in clinical practice may enhance diagnostic accuracy, particularly for culture-negative cases, although improvements in detecting CNS pathogens are necessary.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40846609/,10.1016/j.jos.2025.07.008

This qualitative study conducted 64 in-depth interviews-16 each with pharmacy drug-sellers, pharmaceutical sales-representatives, registered-physicians, and antibiotic-users-across two urban and two rural areas in Bangladesh. Using a social-ecological systems framework, it examined how social-and-commercial determinants influence perceptions and practices in antibiotic marketing, prescription, dispensing, and use. Public-healthcare deficiencies-long waits, medication and staff shortages, limited diagnostics, and referrals to private facilities-render services inadequate and inequitable, pushing patients toward private and informal providers. High consultation fees in private facilities and out-of-pocket costs deter low-income-groups from consulting registered-physicians for 'non-severe illnesses', driving them to seek quick recovery directly from drug-sellers and unqualified-providers. These drug-sellers and informal-providers, known as doctors for their symptomatic-treatment practices, often lead to unnecessary antibiotic use without proper assessment. Weak accountability, poor enforcement, and unregistered pharmacies staffed by untrained personnel allow unregulated sales to persist. Pharmaceutical companies heavily influence prescribing and dispensing through sales representatives, who routinely engage formal and informal providers-advising on dosages and offering financial incentives, commissions, and gifts. Companies strategically target informal-providers and drug-sellers, capitalizing on their symptomatic treatment practices to boost sales, while drug-sellers rely on physician-prescriptions and sales-representatives' guidance. To sustain business, drug-sellers often sell over-the-counter antibiotics and offer symptomatic treatments despite regulations. Patients expect fast recovery, viewing ""good-doctors"" as those who prescribe immediate medications empirically. Patients' prior exposure to antibiotics from informal sources influences formal providers' decisions, leading them to prescribe stronger antibiotics when first-line antibiotics or non-antibiotics would suffice. Cost barriers lead many patients to buy partial courses and stop treatment once symptoms subsite, ignoring advice to complete the regimen-further exacerbating misuse. Effective antimicrobial stewardship requires health-system strengthening, context-specific policies, and behavior-change interventions targeting supply and demand, raising awareness, enforcing regulations, and aligning with stakeholders' economic realities.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40846577/,10.1016/j.sapharm.2025.08.007

We queried the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric (NSQIP-P) dataset for children aged 1-18 years who underwent appendectomy for complicated appendicitis between 2019 and 2023. Patients were included if they were afebrile and had no infective complications (i.e. fever, surgical site infections etc.) at discharge. All patients were stratified into age groups (ages 1-5, 5-10 and 10-18) and were subsequently grouped by whether they were prescribed home OA. The primary outcome measure was post-discharge intra-abdominal abscess (IAA). The relationship between home OA use and post-discharge outcomes was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. A total of 20,190 patients met criteria, with a median age of 10.0 years (IQR: 6.9-13.1). Approximately 70.9 % of patients received home OA and 29.1 % did not. Patient characteristics including age, preoperative WBC count, operative time, and length of stay appeared similar at baseline on unadjusted analysis. On multivariable analysis, home OA use did not reduce the odds of IAA in any age group (Age 1-5: aOR = 1.27, 95 % CI = 0.80-2.09; Age 5-10: aOR = 1.15, 95 % CI = 0.90-1.50; Age 10-18: aOR = 1.05, 95 % CI = 0.86-1.30). A subset analysis conducted for patients aged 5-18 years with intraoperative findings of perforated appendicitis also failed to identify any association between home OA use and post-discharge IAA (aOR = 1.09, 95 % C.I. = 0.92-1.29).

This study established a one-year surveillance of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) from June 2022-2023 in hospitalized children 1-24 months from rural West Bengal India. We tested nasopharyngeal swabs collected from children admitted with SARI using multiplex real-time PCR for influenza, RSV, SARS-CoV-2, with a subset (N = 81) tested for additional respiratory pathogens and analyzed clinical features, factors influencing infections, and hospitalization duration. Of 1842 children admitted with SARI, 77% (1419) were between 1 and 24 months. Of 191 sampled, 21 required intensive care, and 3 died. The majority of mothers (83.7%) were vaccinated against COVID-19, but none against influenza, pertussis, or RSV. Viruses were detected in 44% (84/191), with RSV being the most common 60/190 (31.6%), followed by influenza 12/190 (6.3%), and SARS-CoV-2 2/191 (1%). Influenza subtypes included influenza A/H3 (6/16), A/H1N1pdm (5/16), Influenza B (4/16), and Influenza C (1/16). RSV peaked during autumn, influenza during winter and monsoon. Influenza was more common in infants < 6 months (13.4%, p = 0.03). RSV affected both infants under 6 months and over similarly (34% vs. 29.6%, p = 0.5). Infants < 6 months frequently required oxygen support (p = 0.02), though ICU admissions were similar (p = 0.98). RSV was associated with 19% of ICU admissions and influenza with 14%. Additional pathogens included Haemophilus influenzae (23.45%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (22%), rhinovirus (13.6%), parainfluenza virus group (6.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (8.6%), Moraxella catarrhalis (5%), bocavirus (3.7%), adenovirus (3.7%), Chlamydia pneumoniae (1%), and Bordetella (1%). Viral-bacterial co-detection occurred in 34%, especially in infants < 6 months. Children with RSV had increased risk of having S. pneumoniae [Odds Ratio OR 6.2, 95% CI 1.8-21.3]. Rhinovirus cases were associated with ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and longer length of stay, regardless of age. RSV and influenza were the key contributors to SARI in children under-2.

Antimicrobial resistance is caused by the overprescription of antibiotics as well as self-medication. In 2010, antibiotics were the most commonly prescribed medications according to the Montenegrin Institute of Public Health. To reduce side effects, improve treatment efficacy, and prevent AMR, it is necessary to have greater control and help formulating national and international level policies over antibiotic prescription and their use. This research focuses on the analysis of requests for the dispensing of reserve antibiotics and the justification of their prescription and use. In the Clinical Center of Montenegro, 174 requests for restricted antibiotics were retrospectively analyzed. Data analysis of 174 requests for restricted antibiotics determined that an antibiogram has been performed in only 21.84% of cases, which means that there were 78.16% of cases of empirical antibiotic use. In 72.25% of cases, restricted antibiotics were included in therapy without prior use of unrestricted antimicrobial therapy. Based on data analytics, it can be concluded that using restricted antibiotics in therapy is not completely in line with rational antibiotics implementation. Restricted antibiotics are used without culture sensitivity tests in more than 2/3rd of cases. Similarly, restricted antibiotics were used as first-line therapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40844064/,10.4103/ijp.ijp_947_24

These residues cause economic losses, especially in fermented dairy production and may pose health risks to consumers. Limited data exist on antimicrobial residues in raw milk in Colombia; thus, this study aimed to characterize antimicrobial use and detect residues in BTM from specialized dairy herds. A probabilistic selection of 150 herds from three municipalities in Antioquia, Colombia, was carried out for an epidemiological survey in which each herd was visited once to determine the use of antimicrobials on the farm and for bovine mastitis. One BTM sample per herd (n = 150) was evaluated with the Brilliant Black Reduction Test (BRT), Milksafe™ 2BC, and Milksafe™ 3BTS, for the selective detection of beta-lactam, sulfonamide, and tetracycline residues. Survey results showed that bovine mastitis is the main reason for the use of antibiotics in the dairy herds in the study region. In 47% of herds, antimicrobials were recommended by nonveterinarians, and 78% lacked written treatment records. Cloxacillin-ampicillin was the most used for dry cow therapy, while benzylpenicillin was preferred for mastitis. Antimicrobial residues were found in 13% (19/150) of bulk tank milk samples. Of these 19 positive samples, four samples contained beta-lactams and one sample contained sulfonamides. According to survey data, bovine mastitis is the primary disease in herds for which antibiotics are used and antimicrobial residues in raw milk are present imposing a significant risk for consumers in the region. Therefore, it is a priority to reduce bovine mastitis incidence as well as the application of a program for on-farm antimicrobial administration, oriented to the reduction of the economic impact of inadequate treatments that lead to therapeutic failure and penalties in the price of milk.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40840776/,10.1016/j.jfp.2025.100603

Relevant policies and laws were sourced from government databases, the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations' (FAO) FAOLEX and AMR-LEX databases, and other publicly available resources. The FAO's legal assessment methodology was used to evaluate the policy landscape across nine key thematic areas: (1) veterinary medicinal products, (2) animal health and production practices to prevent animal diseases in terrestrial and aquatic animals, (3) feed registration, (4) pesticides, (5) food safety, (6) environment, soil and waste, (7) water quality, (8) plant health, and (9) institutional coordination. Stakeholder interviews with representatives from relevant government ministries and regulatory bodies validated findings from the document review and provided additional insight into governance challenges. A One Health governance mapping exercise was conducted to identify key institutional actors, assess their role in AMR/AMU governance, and evaluate inter-institutional relationships using social network analysis. The analysis identified 522 policies relevant to AMU in agriculture, with most addressing aquatic animal health (11.3 %,  To address these gaps, we recommend that Malawi: (1) establish a comprehensive AMR and AMU monitoring program, (2) update existing regulations to provide clear definitions and classification of veterinary antimicrobials, (3) develop and implement national veterinary treatment guidelines, (4) restrict non-therapeutic AMU, (5) enhance regulatory oversight of medicated feed, (6) strengthen One Health coordination mechanisms, (7) promote stakeholder collaboration, and (8) secure sustainable, nationally driven funding. Implemention of these measures will enhance antimicrobial stewardship, reduce AMU, mitigate the spread of AMR, and support the long-term sustainability of agricultural production in Malawi.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40838097/,10.1016/j.soh.2025.100119 10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02724-0 10.1016/j.ijregi.2023.01.001 10.1097/MS9.0000000000000113 10.1016/j.jiph.2021.12.008 10.1016/S2214-109X(21)00085-1 10.1016/J.PREVETMED.2024.106263 10.1371/journal.pgph.0001946 10.1371/journal.pgph.0000314 10.1016/J.ONEHLT.2023.100661 10.14202/vetworld.2022.743-749 10.2471/BLT.22.288650 10.3390/antibiotics8010002 10.1016/J.SOCNET.2010.03.006 10.1103/PhysRevLett.87.198701 10.1016/0378-8733(78)90021-7 10.2307/3033543 10.1007/978-3-030-40422-2_13 10.1016/S0167-5877(02)00233-7 10.1128/aac.45.2.627-629.2001 10.1016/j.glmedi.2024.100081 10.4314/jagst.v21i1.7 10.3389/fvets.2024.1304318 10.1186/s40545-019-0184-z 10.3390/antibiotics12010149 10.3389/fvets.2024.1474307 10.3389/fvets.2022.876513 10.1016/S2542-5196(24)00273-0 10.1515/chem-2018-0099 10.1016/j.ijid.2017.09.002 10.1057/S41271-020-00248-9 10.1186/s13756-018-0321-5 10.1186/S12913-022-08007-0 10.3390/ANTIBIOTICS11050613

We aimed to evaluate the impact of antimicrobial stewardship interventions (ASIs) on clinical outcomes in patients with MDRE bloodstream infections (BSI). A single-center, pre-post quasi-experimental study was conducted on patients with BSIs caused by MDRE from March 1, 2014 to February 29, 2016. Infectious disease specialists actively reviewed all positive blood culture notifications and provided evidence-based recommendations for antibiotic therapy. The primary outcomes were 30-day mortality and time to appropriate antibiotics. Secondary outcomes included the hospital length of stay (LOS) after BSIs and duration of antibiotic therapy among survivors. Total 193 patients were included: 73 patients in the pre-intervention period and 120 patients in the intervention period. The 30-day mortality was lower in the intervention group (12.5% vs. 28.8%, P = 0.007). Species identification of BSI pathogens was more rapidly completed (median 70 h vs. 76 h, P = 0.001), and the time to appropriate antibiotics (median 9 h vs. 33 h, P < 0.001) and duration of antibiotic therapy (10 days vs. 12.5 days, P < 0.001) were shorter in the intervention group. Cox regression analysis revealed that ASIs were associated with a better prognosis among adults with MDRE BSIs (hazard ratio: 0.40; 95 % CI: 0.20-0.77; P = 0.006). ASIs can reduce the time to appropriate antimicrobial therapy, shorten antibiotic therapy duration, and improve clinical outcomes in patients with BSIs caused by MDRE.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40835513/,10.1016/j.jmii.2025.08.007
40835182,Augmenting approaches to AMR prevention: a case for environmental sustainability within the WHO core components for infection prevention and control.,"Collins J, Krause A",2025,The Journal of hospital infection,"The growing challenge of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is increasingly understood to be driven by multiple factors including the misuse of antimicrobial products and environmental pollution. However, targeted AMR action in health facilities focuses primarily on antimicrobial stewardship, with limited or no consideration for environmental drivers limiting programme impact. This article seeks to describe how health facilities can expand action against AMR through collaborative One Health approaches, building on the World Health Organization (WHO) core components for infection prevention and control (IPC). A rapid review was conducted on the integration of environmental sustainability, IPC and antimicrobial stewardship across six databases for articles published globally, along with a review of publicly available contemporary guidance documents linked to IPC and environmental sustainability. Current IPC and sustainability practices were then compared with opportunities for sustainability identified across the WHO core components for IPC. Finally, a theorized causal pathway for the implementation of this strategy was developed. Despite increased calls for health facilities to embrace a One Health approach to AMR, there is limited evidence in the literature for how to achieve this. However, significant overlap exists between IPC and sustainability objectives. As such, the authors propose: (i) a theorized causal pathway; and (ii) a strategy to integrate environmental sustainability systematically across the eight WHO core components for IPC. Action against AMR can be accelerated if hospital IPC and sustainability programmes adopt One Health approaches. A framework for this is proposed using the WHO core components for IPC given their widespread use.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40835182/,10.1016/j.jhin.2025.04.038

Educational actions for professionals and patients on microbial resistance were analyzed, as well as interventions to improve prescribing, such as prospective audits, feedback and pre-authorization. The data was grouped by location, care profile and number of beds and analyzed using parametric and non-parametric statistical methods. of the 219 PED-ICUs with ASP in place, 44.7% were in the Southeast and 58.9% carried out continuing education for professionals. Only 6.8% promoted educational activities for patients and companions, concentrated in public hospitals with more than 200 beds. The education component showed weaknesses, especially in smaller hospitals, while actions to improve prescribing were more consolidated, with 70.8% implemented. Private hospitals and those in the Southeast and South stood out in terms of adherence to management practices. the study revealed significant disparities in the implementation of ASPs in Brazilian PED-ICUs, highlighting the need to strengthen continuing education and engage all those involved in order to increase adherence, reduce antimicrobial resistance and improve pediatric care. (1) ASP in Brazilian PED-ICU shows gaps in antimicrobial education and prescription. (2) Insufficient education compromises the rational use of antimicrobials in Brazil. (3) Regional inequality challenges ASP in public and private hospitals. (4) Larger, private hospitals lead the way in adherence to ASP in PED-ICU in Brazil. (5) Educational strategies and audits strengthen antimicrobial control in ASP.

Nitrofurantoin is used as a first-line antibiotic against many uropathogenic bacterial pathogens, including uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), and an analysis is required to assess the current global prevalence of nitrofurantoin-resistant UPEC. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar was performed to find studies reporting nitrofurantoin-resistant UPEC in humans. Studies were included/excluded based on predefined criteria and focused only on isolates collected from the urinary tract. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI's) Checklist for Prevalence Studies. Statistical analysis was performed using Metafor and Meta (R packages) to estimate the pooled prevalence, assess publication bias and perform heterogeneity analysis. Sixty-three studies comprising 774 499 UPEC isolates collected between 1996 and 2024 were analysed and demonstrated a global pooled prevalence of nitrofurantoin-resistant UPEC isolates to be 6.9% (95% CI: 4.8%-9.7%). Continent-wise subgroup analysis showed Europe to have the lowest prevalence, while Asia has the highest prevalence. Decade-wise subgroup analysis showed the global prevalence increased from 2.8% (1996-04) to 8.2% (2005-14) and then decreased to 7.6% in the last decade (2015-24). Substantial heterogeneity was seen among the studies examined, as well as statistically significant publication bias. The findings show considerable global prevalence of nitrofurantoin-resistant UPEC isolates, with the prevalence being higher in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

Since the main cause of AMR is the inappropriate use of antibiotics for prophylactic or empirical treatment, antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASPs) have been developed. Few papers on ASPs describe prospective audits in oncology settings. In light of this, the Italian Association of Medical Oncology (AIOM) has decided to evaluate the oncologists' perceptions of this issue with a brief survey. An anonymous 14-item questionnaire was shared online during the XXVI National Congress on the AIOM website. The survey was divided into two sections. The first set of questions collected the hospital organization and practices (Q1-Q6), while the second one was about the clinical practices and antibiotic therapy (Q7-Q14). Sixty-four medical oncologists completed the anonymous questionnaire. Seventy-two percent of respondents believe that AMR is a significant issue in cancer patients, and an equal percentage considers it likely that a cancer patient will become infected with a MDR pathogen. Despite these concerns, only 48% ( This survey highlights the urgent need for educating and training oncologists on AMR, as well as the importance of the development of oncology-specific guidelines to mitigate the impact of AMR in this high-risk population.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40831750/,10.1093/jacamr/dlaf150 10.1080/14796694.2024.2355081 10.1038/s41568-024-00708-4 10.3322/caac.21697 10.1186/s12941-024-00703-5 10.1093/cid/ciw118 10.6004/jnccn.2019.7318 10.1093/ofid/ofae235 10.1200/OP-24-00935 10.1200/EDBK-25-472902 10.1200/JCO.18.00374 10.1200/JCO.2017.77.6211 10.1007/s10096-023-04698-3 10.2147/IDR.S268574 10.1371/journal.pone.0321551 10.1093/ofid/ofae678 10.1002/cbdv.202401936 10.1093/jacamr/dlae127 10.1177/03008916231191547 10.1016/j.breast.2025.103875

Evaluation of the quantity and appropriateness of common antifungal prescriptions like fluconazole is essential in the development of these programmes. To perform a clinical audit of fluconazole prescribing and explore whether involvement of pharmacy students in this process was feasible and meaningful from both pharmacy student and health system perspectives. An audit was conducted of all fluconazole prescriptions from January 2024 to March 2024 at two Sydney hospitals. Trained pharmacy students, under the supervision of antimicrobial stewardship pharmacists and physicians, completed the audit using the Antifungal National Antimicrobial Prescribing Survey audit tool. Prescriptions were assessed for their compliance to guidelines and appropriateness. Data on pharmacy students' educational experience was collected by a 5-point Likert scale survey. A total of 145 fluconazole prescriptions were audited: 34 for empiric therapy, 56 for directed therapy, and 56 for prophylaxis. A total of 91 (62.8%) prescriptions were assessed as appropriate, 46 (31.7%) were inappropriate, and 8 (5.5%) were not assessable. Potential drug-drug interactions were identified in 17 patients receiving fluconazole doses of 200 mg or greater, of which three were clinically significant, requiring intervention. Students had positive experiences contributing to quality use of medicines, in terms of enjoyment, support, and education. Inappropriate fluconazole use was common. Pharmacy students made a positive contribution to the antifungal audit, promoting good stewardship practises for the hospital while accessing enhanced learning and development opportunities.

However, its clinical utility is often limited by the risk of nephrotoxicity, typically reflected by abnormalities in serum creatinine levels, which may indicate the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI). Timely identification of patients at increased risk is essential for early intervention and improved clinical outcomes. This study aimed to identify clinical risk factors associated with vancomycin-induced abnormalities in serum creatinine levels and to develop predictive models capable of identifying high-risk hospitalized patients during vancomycin therapy. We conducted a retrospective cohort study including 1,008 hospitalized patients who received vancomycin treatment between January 2018 and June 2022 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University. Patients were grouped based on the presence or absence of serum creatinine abnormalities, defined as an increase of ≥ 26.5 μmol/L or ≥ 50% from baseline. Multivariate logistic regression was applied to identify independent risk factors. Five machine learning algorithms-logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, extreme gradient boosting, and gradient boosting machine (GBM)-were trained and compared. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The incidence of serum creatinine abnormalities was 9.22%. Chronic kidney disease, respiratory failure, pancreatitis, pneumonia, and mechanical ventilation were identified as significant risk factors (all p < 0.05). Among the models tested, the GBM algorithm showed the highest predictive performance with an AUC of 0.783, along with good balance between sensitivity and specificity. The final model was deployed as a freely accessible web-based prediction tool using the R Shiny framework. Abnormalities in serum creatinine levels during vancomycin therapy remain a clinically significant concern, especially in patients with comorbidities or critical illness. The machine learning-based predictive model developed in this study offers a practical tool for individualized risk assessment, enabling early risk stratification and proactive management. Incorporating such tools into clinical workflows may enhance patient safety and optimize antibiotic use.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40828437/,10.1007/s11096-025-01981-5 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2009.08.045 10.1007/s11096-024-01822-x 10.1186/s12911-024-02435-0 10.7717/peerj.11764 10.1007/s11096-020-01157-3 10.3389/fphar.2022.815188 10.1007/s11096-024-01745-7 10.1128/spectrum.00499-25 10.2196/63983 10.1248/bpb.b24-00506 10.3389/fphar.2022.924173 10.3389/fphar.2023.1170987 10.3389/fphar.2025.1538074 10.3182/20060329-3-AU-2901.00128 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.682658 10.1023/A:1010933404324 10.1214/aos/1013203451 10.1093/ckj/sfaa142 10.1038/s41572-021-00284-z 10.1016/j.semnephrol.2015.01.004 10.1007/s00228-019-02648-7

We investigated several previously underexplored key factors, including socioeconomic status (SES), education, lifestyle, mental health, and COVID-19 history. A population-based cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted in three major regions of southern Tehran in 2023, involving 1,311 adult participants who were selected through stratified random sampling with probability proportional to size. A structured composite index was developed using data on lifestyle factors such as body mass index, physical activity, smoking, nutrition, mental and physical health, socioeconomic status, and frequency of SMA. Of the participants, 50.4% were male and 49.6% female, with an overall SMA prevalence of 21.3% (n = 279). Higher education (AOR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.25-2.96, p value = 0.003), higher SES (AOR = 3.59, 95% CI = 1.82-6.82, p value < 0.001), basic insurance (AOR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.10-2.63, p value = 0.019), and a history of uncomplicated COVID-19 infection (AOR = 2.30, 95% CI = 1.44-3.78, p value = 0.001) were significantly associated with increased SMA. In contrast, a healthy lifestyle (AOR = 0.66, p value = 0.033) and good mental health (AOR = 0.31, p value < 0.001) were associated with lower SMA rates. Our findings primarily suggest that we should focus our public health efforts on specific subpopulations affected by SMA. Community-based antibiotic stewardship programs should use educational and behavioral approaches with an emphasis on mental health and health literacy. Policymakers should also consider whether to modify regulations to prevent the general public from obtaining antibiotics without a prescription. Finally, the findings from a representative sample from southern Tehran illustrate the value of local data in national AMR decision-making and avoiding assumptions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40826378/,10.1186/s41043-025-01053-4

We conducted a cross-sectional study in 340 commercial chicken farms comprising broilers (109), layers (109), and Sonali (122) farms in seven districts of Bangladesh from September to October 2021. Data were collected using in-person interviews with a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire. Statistical analyses were performed, including descriptive statistics to understand farmer demographics and AMU practices, a Chi-square test to evaluate farmers' knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP), and logistic regression analysis to determine the factors associated with AMU. The findings indicated that 93.2% (317/340) farms administered at least one antimicrobial (AM) to chickens during the production cycle, with 67.0% of farmers used antimicrobials (AMs) in the 14 days before data collection. The usage of AMs was higher in meat-type chickens, such as broiler (78.0%) and Sonali (67.2%), in contrast to egg-type chickens, like layer (41.3%). The AMU practices were significantly associated with multiple factors, such as farming experience, poultry production type, knowledge gaps in proper AMU practices, the person managing the farm, reuse of left-over AMs, and compliance with veterinarians' recommendations. We highlight the indiscriminate use of AMs that is occurring in poultry industry in Bangladesh, which could result in AM residues and resistance, posing detrimental consequences for public health.

Pharmacists play a key role in ASPs through patient education, prescription monitoring, and promoting appropriate use. This study assessed the status of ASPs in primary healthcare centres (PHCs) in São Paulo state from the pharmacists' perspective. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between June 2023 and January 2024 among pharmacists working in PHCs across São Paulo. The questionnaire, based on CDC and ANVISA guidelines, addressed demographics, PHC characteristics, ASP activities, and pharmaceutical interventions. Descriptive statistics were used. Of 201 responses, 189 were eligible, representing PHCs in 68 cities. Most pharmacists (75%) had postgraduate education, and 70% worked in centres serving over 500 patients. Although 79% of PHCs used electronic medical records, only 32% had written ASP policies and 29% monitored antimicrobial use. Diagnostic resources were limited; respiratory virus tests were the most available (43%). Educational activities on antimicrobial use occurred in 26% of PHCs. Pharmaceutical interventions were reported by 77% of pharmacists, mainly related to dosage (54%) and treatment duration (25%), with high prescriber acceptance (≥80% in 34% of cases). This study identified strengths and gaps in ASP implementation across PHCs. While improvements were seen in infrastructure and pharmacist training, key limitations remain in policy development, diagnostics, prescriber support, and public education.

We assessed the degree urinalysis is ordered in absence of urinary symptoms. We randomly sampled 97 unique patients with urinalyses (UAs) obtained in the Emergency Department in 2022 and reviewed their charts to determine if UAs were ordered according to society guideline-based indications. To identify risk factors for inappropriate ordering, we performed simple logistic regression between patients with inappropriately versus appropriately obtained urinalysis by various demographic factors. Following an intervention where nursing order sets were modified to reflect appropriate urinalysis usage, we reassessed the appropriateness of UAs in a sample of 95 unique patients within 6months postintervention. Preintervention, 65% (95% CI, 54.1%-74.5%) of patients had inappropriately ordered UAs.

40818488,Duration of Therapy With Amoxicillin/Clavulanate for Postoperative Antimicrobial Prophylaxis of Fractures of the Facial Skeleton: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Reinert JP, Quach V, Carroll S",2025,Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons,"The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for fractures of the facial skeleton remains uncertain, particularly regarding the balance between efficacy and safety. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and appropriate duration of amoxicillin-clavulanate (AM-C) prophylaxis in patients undergoing surgical intervention of facial fractures. A comprehensive search of PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted through December 2024. The search included terms such as ""maxillofacial injuries"" AND ""amoxicillin-potassium clavulanate combination"" and was limited to human studies and full-text publications. Eligible studies assessed AM-C use, duration, and safety in surgically managed facial fractures. Included designs were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective studies, and retrospective cohorts. Studies lacking details on antibiotic regimen, duration, or outcomes were excluded. Data were extracted per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, including infection rates, adverse events, and definitions of therapy duration. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and ROBINS-I framework. Meta-analysis of RCTs was performed using a common effect model, with P values <0.05 considered statistically significant. Efficacy was defined by perioperative infection rates; safety by incidence of antibiotic-related adverse events. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 270 patients from 4 RCTs and a total of 3,115 patients. Meta-analysis showed no significant difference in infection rates between short (≤24 hours) and long (>24 hours) perioperative AM-C regimens (odds ratio = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.40 to 1.84; P = .783). Adverse effects, including gastrointestinal symptoms and Clostridium difficile infection, were more common with prolonged therapy but did not reach statistical significance (odds ratio = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.11 to 2.62; P = .867). Observational studies supported these findings. Short-duration AM-C perioperative prophylaxis appears sufficient for preventing infections in facial fracture surgery, with fewer adverse effects and reduced antibiotic exposure, supporting antimicrobial stewardship principles.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40818488/,10.1016/j.joms.2025.07.009

Real-time microbiological information has been shown to have an impact on prognosis when combined with an antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) program. dRAST is a rapid commercial antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) system based on real-time microscopy. The primary outcome of this trial was to compare positive blood culture's time-to-result (TTR), defined as time from Gram stain to AST report, between dRAST and our standard of care in a real-life clinical setting. Secondary outcomes included microbiological concordance, time to antimicrobial stewardship recommendation (TAMS), and time to change antimicrobial prescription (TCAP) in agreement with AMS recommendation. We performed a prospective, open-label, randomized (1:1) diagnostic clinical trial comparing dRAST and our standard of care commercial MicroScan broth microdilution (MBMD) (MicroScan-Walkaway, Beckman-Coulter, USA) in 277 hospitalized patients with bacteremia.

40814480,Importance of hospital-specific antibiotic policy for ensuring maternal quality of care in India: A narrative review.,"Banerjee A, Biswas J",2025,Journal of family medicine and primary care,"Maternal health is pivotal in India, where infections significantly drive maternal morbidity and mortality. While antibiotics are essential for preventing sepsis, neonatal Group B Streptococcus, and surgical site infections (SSI), their misuse-fueled by empirical prescribing, self-medication, and over-the-counter access-has escalated antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This challenge is compounded by India's high maternal mortality, uneven healthcare resources, and cultural practices. Tailored, hospital-specific antibiotic policies, grounded in local epidemiology, resistance patterns, and resources, are critical to optimizing use and enhancing care quality. This narrative review synthesized National (ICMR, NCDC) and International (WHO, ACOG) guidelines, local resistance data, antibiograms. epidemiological studies, and stewardship interventions related to maternal infections. Key sources included the WHO AWaRe antibiotic classification and local antibiograms. Antibiotics are classified into first, second and third-line treatments for various obstetric conditions and treatments based on patient demographics, resources, and resistance patterns, with ongoing policy evaluation adapted to hospital-specific needs. Recommendations were adapted to local resistance patterns, resource availability, and patient demographics. Excessive antibiotic use exacerbates AMR and adverse outcomes, but hospital-specific policies prioritizing narrow-spectrum agents, guided by local antibiograms shown less complications. Incorporating stewardship measures (e.g., prophylaxis criteria, formulary restrictions, audits, and education) improved guideline adherence, curbed broad- spectrum use, and bolstered neonatal safety. Implementing hospital-specific antibiotic policies effectively reduces infection rates and improves maternal-neonatal outcomes through standardized regimens prioritizing narrow-spectrum antibiotics and utilizing local antibiograms. Key stewardship strategies included defined prophylaxis protocols, formulary restrictions, and ongoing education, all contributing to enhanced maternal and neonatal safety. Hospital-specific antibiotic policies provide an evidence-based framework for optimizing antibiotic use in obstetrics by aligning national and international guidelines with local epidemiological and resistance data. These tailored policies strengthen antimicrobial stewardship and clinical decision-making, mitigate AMR, and improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. Implementing such frameworks in India's diverse healthcare landscape is vital to safeguarding treatment efficacy, improving outcomes amid rising resistance and effective maternal healthcare delivery in India.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40814480/,10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_2133_24

Rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR), especially among Gram-negative (GN) bacteria, challenges effective empirical antibiotic therapy (EAT) selection. This ECIL-10 systematic review updates European resistance epidemiology since the 2011 ECIL-4 guidelines publication to inform clinical recommendations. We conducted a systematic review (ID: CRD42025638003) of bacterial epidemiology and resistance in HM/HCT patients across Europe, from June 2011 to September 2024, using PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science according to PRISMA guidelines. We included studies reporting BSI or colonization rates and resistance patterns, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing/third-generation cephalosporin-resistant (ESBL/3GCR), fluoroquinolone-resistant (FQ-R) carbapenem-resistant (CR), and multidrug-resistant (MDR) for GN bacteria; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) for Gram-positive (GP) bacteria. Two reviewers independently extracted data with ECDC/EARS-Net surveillance 2011 and 2022 data providing supporting analysis. We examined fluoroquinolone prophylaxis (FQ-P) impact on BSI rate and resistance. Analysis included 40 studies (33,387 patients/febrile episodes from observational studies and 21,402 patients from one meta-analysis) across 12 European countries. BSI prevalence averaged 30% (range, 15-59%), with 42% GN and 51% GP distribution. Median resistance rates among GN BSI were: 55% for FQ-R, 30% for ESBL/3GCR, 13% for both CR and MDR. CR reached 26% in P. aeruginosa (PsA) and 38% in K. pneumoniae (KPn). Among GP BSI resistance was 3% for MRSA and 1% for VRE. Colonization studies demonstrated 20% ESBL/3GCR and 5% CR rates. We identified a southeastern European resistance gradient and significant temporal increase in ESBL/3GCR, CR KPn, and MDR PsA, confirmed in ECDC/EAR-Net analysis. FQ-P reduced overall and GN BSI incidence but increased FQ-R and ESBL/3GCR GN infections in adults. In children, FQ-P reduced BSI in leukemia but not in HCT and data on resistance were inconclusive. ECIL-10 proposed resistance reporting aligned with ESCMID/IDSA guidelines. AMR presents an escalating challenge in febrile neutropenic HM/HCT patients with geographical variability and increasing resistance trends. These findings strongly support the need for updated guidelines, antimicrobial stewardship programs, rapid diagnostics implementation, and prospective studies to optimize effective empirical therapy strategies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40812455/,10.1016/j.jinf.2025.106571

Adult studies suggest antibiotic prophylaxis for elective cholecystectomy may not be needed. Our quality improvement project aimed to decrease prophylactic antibiotic use for elective cholecystectomies from 100 % to ≤50 % and maintain that rate for one year. Prior to initiation, the pre-operative orderset was modified, education was provided, and surgeon consensus was achieved. All patients undergoing elective minimally invasive (laparoscopic and robotic) cholecystectomy were included. Exclusion criteria included acute cholecystitis, immunocompromised state, or performance of a combined procedure. Compliance was measured by chart review, with feedback provided for noncompliance. The project was initiated January 2024. Data were collected for twelve months prior (1/23-12/23) and after initiation (1/24-12/24). The balancing measure was surgical site infection (SSI). Ninety patients met inclusion criteria (40 pre-protocol and 50 post-protocol). Median age at surgery was 16 years (IQR 14, 17.2). Seventy-seven (86 %) patients were female. Prior to implementation, all patients (n = 40) received prophylactic antibiotics. In the first three months post-implementation, 3/16 (19 %) received antibiotic prophylaxis (due to inadequate communication with anesthesia providers). In the subsequent nine months, 0/34 (0 %) received antibiotic prophylaxis. One (2.5 %) patient in the pre-implementation group was noted to have an SSI requiring antibiotics vs. 3 (6 %) patients in the post-implementation group (p = 0.43). Use of prophylactic antibiotics for elective minimally invasive cholecystectomy decreased from 100 % to 6 % without significantly increasing the rate of SSI.

In dentistry, antimicrobials are commonly prescribed in large scale in dental outpatient settings. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) in a such dental hospital setting in Japan, using an interrupted time-series analyses. Monthly summarized data from medical records of all outpatients who received oral antimicrobials at the dental university hospital in Kanagawa Prefecture in Japan were evaluated. We compared time trends for the number of days of therapy (DOT), the number of long-term antimicrobial prescription cases, and the proportion of inappropriate long-term AMU, during the periods before (November 2017 to March 2019) and after (April 2019 to August 2021) the ASP introduction. Following the introduction of the ASP, the mean DOT decreased by approximately 4.4 days (P < .001), although the decline began before program implementation. The actual number of long-term AMU cases was 13 fewer than the predicted 38 per month (95% CI: -25 to -2, P = .027), and the proportion of inappropriate long-term AMU decreased by 23.1% (95% CI: -37.6% to -8.7%, P = .002). These trends persisted for up to 2 years post-ASP implementation. The introduction of the ASP significantly reduced the number of long-term oral antimicrobial prescriptions and the proportion of inappropriate long-term AMU in outpatient dental care. However, the inappropriate use rate remained a concern at 27.8%, indicating the necessity for maintenance of sustained ASPs. The objectives outlined in the Global Action Plan (2015) by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Japan's National Action Plan (2016-2020) on AMR seem t to have been under achieved.

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of integrating DASC into the Japan Surveillance for Infection Prevention and Healthcare Epidemiology (J-SIPHE) system. Retrospective observational study. Hospitals voluntarily participating in J-SIPHE. Inpatients from 1,833 hospitals between January 2019 and December 2022. Antibiotic use was assessed using DOT, DASC, and DASC/DOT. Antibiotic spectrum coverage scores were assigned based on published data or expert consensus. Annual trends were assessed using median values, and hospital-level variation was explored by hospital size. Proportional use of antibiotic classes by DOT and DASC was compared using 2022 data. As the number of hospitals participating in J-SIPHE increased over time-particularly small and medium-sized hospitals-median DOT and DASC per 1,000 patient-days declined by 21.2% and 19.1%, respectively, from 2019 to 2022, while DASC/DOT remained stable. In 2022, proportional use of antibiotic classes varied by hospital size, and rankings differed when comparing DOT- and DASC-based measures. Broad-spectrum agents such as carbapenems and fluoroquinolones ranked higher by DASC than DOT. Hospital-level distributions of DOT and DASC/DOT showed substantial variation across hospital sizes. Integration of DASC metrics into national surveillance is feasible. DASC and DASC/DOT complement DOT by incorporating spectrum breadth, providing more comprehensive insight into antimicrobial use patterns and supporting stewardship benchmarking and intervention planning.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40808896/,10.1017/ash.2025.10086

This systematic scoping review evaluates the current landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications in sepsis care, focusing on early detection, personalized antibiotic management, and resistance forecasting. Literature from 2019 to 2025 was systematically reviewed following PRISMA-ScR guidelines. A total of 129 full-text articles were analyzed, with study quality assessed via the JBI and QUADAS-2 tools. AI-based models demonstrated robust predictive performance for early sepsis detection (AUROC 0.68-0.99), antibiotic stewardship, and resistance prediction. Notable tools, such as InSight and KI.SEP, leveraged multimodal clinical and biomarker data to provide actionable, real-time support and facilitate timely interventions. AI-driven platforms showed potential to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use and nephrotoxicity while optimizing outcomes. However, most models are limited by single-center data, variable interpretability, and insufficient real-world validation. Key challenges remain regarding data integration, algorithmic bias, and ethical implementation.

The prevalence of multidrug-resistant Salmonella species has significantly increased in recent years. A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2022 to May 2023 to determine the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of Salmonella in apparently healthy slaughtered cattle and abattoir personnel at Gondar Elfora abattoir. The study was conducted 253 samples in total, including 75 carcass swabs, 75 liver tissue samples, 75 intestinal contents samples, and 14 stool and 14 water samples from the slaughterhouse. Salmonella isolates were identified using standard isolation and identification techniques. Each isolate was also subjected to Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion tests for antimicrobial susceptibility. STATA version 14 was used to compute and analyses various data from slaughterhouses, antimicrobial susceptibility test results, and animal samples using descriptive statistics. The overall proportion of Salmonella positive isolates was 13.4%( 253/34) in difference sample sources. The prevalence of Salmonella in cattle was 12% (27/225), of which 17.3% were from carcass swabs, 10.7% were from liver tissue, 8% were from intestinal contents, 14.3% were from human stool, and 35.7% were from water samples. Salmonella isolates were resistant to antimicrobials with specific resistance rates 58.82% for cefoxitin (95%Rn: 42.28 - 75.37), 41.2% (95%Rn: 24.63 - 57.72) for ampicillin and 35.3% (95%Rn: 19.23 - 51.36) for tetracycline. Low resistance pattern was reported in chloramphenicol 17.65% and nalidixic acid 14.71%. The study highlights the high prevalence of Antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella, a significant public health concern, emphasizing the need for effective surveillance, control measures, biosecurity, Mandatory abattoir worker training, and Antimicrobial stewardship in livestock.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40804357/,10.1186/s12866-025-04262-3

We conducted semistructured interviews at 5 Veterans Affairs hospitals about the acceptability of 4 prospectively identified potential interventions to deimplement routine preoperative urine testing for ASB: substitution of another infection prevention intervention, laboratory restrictions on ordering urine tests, audit and feedback on guideline concordance, and interactive workshops. We coded responses as acceptable, not acceptable, or possibly acceptable and noted recommendations for modifications. We interviewed 35 clinicians. Clinicians expressed concerns about deimplementing routine urine testing for specific procedures and specialties. Some actively sought to identify and treat ASB. Interviewees found audit and feedback and substitution of different infection control practices most acceptable. Interviewees suggested changes to make interventions more acceptable or feasible and identified new potential interventions. Understanding clinical decision-making about preoperative urine screening and treatment can help design effective interventions to facilitate guideline concordance and support antibiotic stewardship. Interventions to optimize preoperative urine screening and treatment may require tailoring for surgical specialties and should address clinical concerns about intervention feasibility.

However, several previous studies failed to identify differences in the vaginal microbiota between healthy dogs and those with reproductive tract disorders; thus, treating healthy bitches with antimicrobials regardless of the bacterial findings is contraindicated. To investigate current practices of German small animal veterinarians regarding microbiological sampling and antimicrobial treatment in canine reproductive medicine, we conducted an online survey using LimeSurvey®. The questionnaire included questions (single/multiple choice) about procedures of microbiological swab sampling and handling in general and in canine reproductive medicine specifically, as well as on antimicrobial use in the respective field. The objective was to identify educational and research needs regarding vaginal bacterial culture interpretation and antimicrobial treatment in canine breeding. We found that treating clinically healthy breeding bitches remains common practice among both breeders and veterinarians. Our findings highlight the importance of continuous education and improved communication to reduce inappropriate antimicrobial use in canine reproduction.

In Benin, high AMR rates to common antibiotics, including last-resort treatments, exacerbate infection outcomes and healthcare costs. Inappropriate antibiotic use worsens this challenge. To address these issues, Benin implemented its National Multisectoral AMR Action Plan 2019-2024. This study aims to assess the implementation of Benin's National AMR Action Plan 2019-2024 and identify critical gaps for future updates. The evaluation covered six of Benin's 12 departments, engaging stakeholders from human, animal and environmental health sectors. A retrospective cross-sectional evaluation was performed from 05 August 2024 to 30 September 2024. Data were collected through a documentary review, standardised questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and group discussions. An executed scoring grid and a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats analysis were used. Of the 224 planned activities, 40.18% were not initiated, 31.25% had started, 19.64% were partially executed, 5.36% were nearly completed and only 3.57% were fully implemented. Critical gaps included the lack of a fully operational multisectoral coordination group, limited financial resources, inadequate surveillance systems, insufficient communication and education initiatives and the absence of infection prevention and control (IPC) programmes. Despite progress in regulatory frameworks, gaps in coordination, resources, surveillance and IPC hinder effective AMR control in Benin. Strengthening governance, communication and addressing other identified gaps are critical for future success.

The data originated from accessing the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, which is a global monitoring program that has been ongoing since 1997 with a purpose of tracking and reporting susceptibility of clinical isolates collected from various infection sources. Isolates meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition for community-acquired UTI were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility against 17 antimicrobial agents using broth microdilution methodology specified by the Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Isolates were interpreted as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant as appropriate using Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing breakpoints and characterized for extended-spectrum β-lactamase and multidrug-resistant phenotypes. The percentage of isolates susceptible to the oral agents amoxicillin-clavulanate, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fluoroquinolones was 70%-85% throughout the study period, which crosses the acceptable threshold of 80% for empiric use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole per the 2010 Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines. Higher susceptibility (>90%) was observed for all agents administered via intravenous or intramuscular route. Variation in susceptibility profiles was observed by census region, with the highest resistant rates commonly found in the Middle Atlantic.

Dairy farm workers gained a significant increase in knowledge of the 8 desired outcomes, related to occupational health skills that reduce risks, from our intervention. Limited time was a major barrier as to why dairy farm workers felt like they could not make behavioral changes that would reduce their occupational health risk. Dairy farmworkers showed a strong likelihood of making workplace health-related behavioral changes, but their intention to change was weaker in areas of personal antibiotic stewardship. This study focused on developing and evaluating an educational intervention designed to mitigate occupational health risks associated with pathogens and antibiotic-resistant bacteria among dairy farm workers. Data collected from farms and workers as part of a larger umbrella project that focused on dairy farm antibiotic use for cows and calves were used to inform elements of the Health Belief Model and the Theory of Planned Behavior, leading to eight intervention outcomes. The intervention targeted increased knowledge and promoted behavioral changes related to worker and workplace hygiene best practices, PPE use, biosecurity, and personal antibiotic stewardship. Educational materials included instructional videos, fact sheets in English and Spanish, and supplementary printed material, including illustrated take-home points, content summaries, and posters. The intervention was conducted with 32 workers from five dairy farms, using pre- and post-intervention assessments to measure knowledge gains and behavioral intentions. Results demonstrated statistically significant increases in knowledge across all targeted outcomes (p-value ≤ .001), with most participants showing a high willingness and likelihood to implement recommended behaviors related to their workplace exposures and best practices. However, participants indicated a greater reluctance to change around issues of personal antibiotic stewardship. Time constraints were the most significant and most consistent barrier to behavior change. The study highlights the importance of ongoing research and refinement of intervention strategies to address barriers and enhance protective practices among often underserved farmworkers in agriculture. These intervention strategies contribute to improved occupational health outcomes with benefits to public health by reducing the spread of antibiotic-resistant infections to the broader population.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40794961/,10.13031/jash.16158

This study aimed to assess the diagnostic impact of POC-PCR testing in patients with suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the ED. This study is a secondary analysis of a Danish multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) that included patients aged ≥18 years admitted to the ED between March 2021 and February 2022. In the primary trial, patients were randomly assigned to one of two parallel groups: (i) intervention group: POC-PCR in addition to standard care, or (ii) control group: standard care only (SCO). The present secondary analysis focuses exclusively on patients in the intervention group, where both POC-PCR and standard culture-based diagnostics were performed. The diagnosis of CAP was determined by an expert panel. In the intervention group, 145 patients had a lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens analyzed using both POC-PCR and culture. POC-PCR identified notably more microorganisms compared with culture (187 vs 34). The agreement between positive results obtained by POC-PCR and culture was 6 of 19 (31.6%) for  Our findings suggest that point-of-care (POC)-PCR testing can significantly enhance the diagnostic accuracy for CAP in the emergency department (ED), thereby facilitating more targeted and effective antimicrobial treatment.

Evaluating doctors’ prescribing practices is crucial for improving antibiotic stewardship and minimizing resistance. This study evaluated the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of doctors concerning antibiotic prescribing and to identify factors influencing their prescribing behaviours at Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Edo State, Nigeria. A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted from January to August 2024 among 205 doctors selected randomly from five department. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS version 23. This study included 205 doctors, with mean age of 31.5 years. Most of the participants were males (60.5%), Christians (84.4%) and from Esan ethnic group. The survey revealed that 142 (69.3%) of the participants had good knowledge of antibiotic prescribing, and 185 (90.2%) and 189 (92.2%) of the clinicians reported adhering to hospital and international guidelines, respectively. Despite this, only 73 (35.6%) had attended recent training on antibiotic use. Influencing factors included poor-quality antibiotics 113 (55.1%) and increased clinical experience 99 (48.3%). Although 99 (48.3%) of the clinicians felt confident in their prescribing abilities, prescription alterations by senior colleagues were noted. Doctors at Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital generally possess good knowledge and adherence to antibiotic guidelines. However, insufficient training and poor-quality antibiotics are barriers to optimal prescribing practices.

Despite frequent human-animal-environment interactions in Ethiopia, One Health studies on Campylobacter occurrence and transmission are crucial but lacking. A cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2021 to March 2022 in central Ethiopia using a One Health approach to assess Campylobacter occurrence and resistance in humans, poultry and environment, and identify risk factors in humans and poultry. A total of 366 samples from 122 poultry farms were collected, including cloacal swabs, human stools, and poultry house floor samples. Epidemiological data on risk factors and respondents' awareness were gathered through interviews. Campylobacter spp. were isolated following ISO 10272, confirmed with multiplex PCR and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using the disc diffusion method according EUCAST guidelines. Campylobacter spp. were detected in 12.5% samples, highest in poultry (19.6%), followed by humans (13.1%) and poultry house floor (4.9%). Campylobacter jejuni was the dominant species (80.4%), followed by C. coli (19.6%). In poultry, mixed farming with cattle increased Campylobacter colonization odds (adjusted odds ratio; AOR = 9.5), while all-in/all-out management decreased it (AOR = 8.4).

In South Africa, AMR and zoonotic disease outbreaks pose significant threats to public health and food security. Despite a robust AMR surveillance system for human health, the absence of a national routine surveillance program for livestock hinders a comprehensive One Health (OH) approach. The 2024 UK-South Africa workshop in Cape Town convened key stakeholders from human and animal health, environmental sciences, and food production to address these challenges. Discussions focused on integrating OH surveillance, leveraging Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) for early outbreak detection, and improving food and water safety. Workshop outcomes emphasized the necessity of cross-sector collaboration to enhance AMR monitoring and outbreak preparedness. Stakeholder engagement, particularly within agricultural communities, was identified as critical for OH implementation. Participants highlighted the need for culturally sensitive engagement strategies, qualitative research methods, and policy reforms to drive adoption. Lessons from tuberculosis (TB) and HIV programs informed strategies for fostering compliance and integrating OH principles into veterinary education, particularly in antimicrobial stewardship. Challenges such as resource limitations, bioinformatics capacity gaps, and resistance to new technologies were addressed through recommendations for joint consortia, leveraging existing infrastructure, and targeted training. Aligning OH initiatives with consumer-driven concerns, such as water quality monitoring, was also identified as a key opportunity.

Providers were most interested in patient-facing educational materials that would help support best practices. However, substantial variability existed in responses about antibiotic prescribing; some (15%) respondents stated that they rarely review guidelines or use antibiotic stewardship resources. Providers felt that any feedback about antibiotic prescribing practices should be provided via email and should focus on reducing antibiotic use for viral conditions.

A greater frequency of monitoring, along with controlling for age, recent treatments, and disease events at the individual level, would improve farm-level insights from on-farm AMR monitoring. Currently, the interpretation of phenotypic AMR data for resistance monitoring in swine medicine is limited by the lack of established veterinary breakpoints for enteric organisms.

An all-language article search conducted for 2000-2024, using broad search terms: 'Antimicrobial resistance policies', 'national action plan', 'surveillance', 'AMR systems' supplemented by hand searches. Deductive analysis using multi-disciplinary frameworks including the Expert Consensus for Implementation Research (ERIC). b. Longitudinal quantitative analysis assessing country contextual determinants and Antimicrobial Use (AMU) and AMR outcomes. Data from global health indicator repositories and international and national AMU and AMR surveillance networks are analysed using econometrics and machine learning approaches.c. Interactive Tableau dashboard development to display insights from a & b to allow visualisation and comparison of case-country AMR intervention context and components. This protocol provides a systematic, transparent approach for countries to benchmark their own AMR strategies. The interactive dashboard will allow comparisons between country clusters by geography or economy, and enable rapid knowledge mobilisation among strategic and operational stakeholders including policy makers and planners. This protocol facilitates others to perform this structured assessment and nominate their country for the next wave of analysis. Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is when microbes become resistant to the drugs (antimicrobials) used to treat them. As this poses a growing problem to society, many countries have developed a National Action Plan (NAP) to outline their strategies to address this problem of AMR. There is limited funding to carry forward the plans, and limited knowledge of which strategies are the most effective. We therefore, need a better understanding of why some countries are more successful than others in using antimicrobials only when needed and reducing infections that are non-treatable by antimicrobials. Our study aims to create a standardised approach for evaluating AMR NAPs through policy analysis as well as developing a tool to enable countries to compare performance and promote knowledge sharing. The investigation has three components: a. Text analysis of the existing literature and policies from multiple countries, b. Data analysis of the factors within countries that affect the use of antimicrobials and the development of AMR, c. Developing a tool to visualise and compare country data on AMR interventions. This will enable the creation of a method for countries to better understand their AMR situation, compare strategies and use resources most effectively.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40786641/,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.22923.2 10.6084/m9.figshare.27008017.v1 10.7189/jogh.11.05011 10.1136/bmjgh-2019-001730 10.1016/S0140-6736(22)02459-X 10.1016/j.lanepe.2021.100161 10.1016/S2214-109X(23)00019-0 10.1038/s41579-024-01076-4 10.3390/microorganisms11041050 10.1080/0266476042000214501 10.2196/jmir.8775 10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.08.035 10.1080/03009734.2016.1195900 10.1016/B978-0-12-815739-8.00012-2 10.1093/jacamr/dlad031 10.18178/ijmlc.2021.11.3.1038 10.1111/1467-9566.12897 10.1057/9780230280816_8 10.2147/IDR.S290835 10.1016/j.jhin.2018.06.026 10.1093/heapol/czx039 10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02724-0 10.1016/S0140-6736(24)01867-1 10.1038/s43856-023-00386-7 10.1016/S1473-3099(22)00796-4 10.1016/j.envres.2021.112059 10.1136/bmjgh-2022-009283 10.1186/s13012-015-0209-1 10.3390/antibiotics10111320 10.1136/bmj.e4483 10.1109/HealthCom.2014.7001904 10.1016/S0140-6736(24)01076-6 10.36834/cmej.68903 10.1186/1471-2288-8-45 10.1006/jmps.1999.1278 10.7189/jogh.11.05012 10.1016/j.puhe.2015.10.012 10.1007/s00204-023-03656-4 10.1787/ce44c755-en

ICU-related CAUTI is associated with longer hospital stays, greater financial burden, greater antibiotic use and impact on mortality. This study aimed to address the incidence and risk factors, causative pathogens and outcomes of CAUTI among patients admitted to the ICU of a tertiary University Hospital. This is a prospective study. All adult patients admitted to the ICU of a University Hospital who had indwelling urinary catheters (IUCs) at admission were included. Based on the occurrence of CAUTI, the study cohorts were divided into two groups: those with CAUTI and those without CAUTI. The incidence, risk factors, causative pathogens and the outcomes of patients with CAUTI were addressed. One hundred and forty patients were enrolled, with a mean age of 43.84 ± 13.86 years, and 69/140 (49.3%) were male. The incidence of CAUTI was 43.5. CAUTI were significantly related to older age, female sex, smoking, post-surgery, diabetes mellitus (DM), obstructive uropathy, immobility, faecal incontinence and the duration of urinary catheterisation. Cox regression analysis revealed that the most significant risk factors for CAUTI were the duration of urinary catheterisation, DM and post-surgery, with hazard ratio of 7.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.78-14.63, p < 0.001, 6.25, 95% CI 3.13-11.47, p < 0.001 and 2.34, 95% CI 1.23-4.45, p = 0.010, respectively. The current study shows that the incidence of CAUTI among ICU patients is high. Numerous risk factors for CAUTI were identified and included older age, female sex, longer duration of catheterisation, smoking, post-surgery, DM, obstructive uropathy and immobility. The most significant risk factors for CAUTI were the duration of urinary catheterisation, DM and post-surgery. Special precautions are needed to prevent CAUTI among ICU patients with those risk factors. The results of this study will have implications for daily ICU practice. It is important to identify high-risk patients and consider targeted preventive measures. Ongoing education for healthcare workers on CAUTI prevention and management should be taken into account.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40785622/,10.1111/nicc.70135

Previously, our institution had a 95.7 % rate of discharge on oral antibiotics and was an outlier compared to NSQIP-P peer hospitals. We aimed to decrease oral antibiotics at discharge to 35 % by the end of 2024 while monitoring balancing measures and outcomes. A multidisciplinary quality improvement team developed a CPG directing postoperative antibiotic utilization, clinically based discharge parameters, and indications for postoperative diagnostic imaging. Implementation began in April 2024 with provider education and an electronic health record order set. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients receiving oral antibiotics at discharge. Balancing measures were length of stay (LOS), organ-space surgical site infection (OSI), ED return and readmissions within 30 days. Data were analyzed using p-charts to detect special cause variation over the pre-implementation (01/2024-03/2024), transition (04/2024-06/2024), post-implementation (07/2024-09/2024) and maintenance (10/2024-12/2024) periods. 90.7 % of patients received oral antibiotics at discharge in the 3-month baseline pre-implementation period (n=43), with a mean LOS of 4 days (SD ± 2.2), OSI rate 7 %, 12 % return ED visit rate, and 7 % readmission rate. After quality improvement interventions, oral antibiotic duration decreased over time, without impacting LOS, ED visits, Readmissions, or OSI rates.

In line with the Global Action Plan (GAP) on AMR, Jordan developed its first National Action Plan (NAP) for 2018-2022 to guide national efforts. This study aimed to evaluate the implementation of Jordan's AMR NAP 2018-2022, identify progress and challenges across its five strategic objectives, and suggest actionable recommendations for strengthening future AMR responses. A comprehensive end-term evaluation was conducted for the NAP 2018-2022 by the Jordan Center for Disease Control (Jordan CDC), utilizing a structured evaluation tool including sector-specific and multi-sectoral indicators aligned with the five objectives of the AMR NAP. Data were collected via national stakeholder workshop and follow-up electronic communications, with consensus-based completion by multi-sectoral working groups. Descriptive analysis was used to assess implementation across human, animal, food and environmental sectors, applying the One Health approach. The evaluation revealed uneven implementation across sectors and NAP objectives, with notable achievements in the rational use of antimicrobials (69%), mainly in the human health sector, followed by infection prevention and control (IPC) efforts (63%), and surveillance-related activities (56%). Lower progress was reported for awareness activities (47%), while research and innovation activities were not implemented during 2018-2022. Although human health sector activities dominated, gaps persisted across the animal, food, and environmental sectors. Limited intersectoral coordination, the absence of a unified communication strategy, lack of dedicated funding, insufficient investment in human resources and laboratories, and the disruptions caused by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic further constrained implementation. The findings underscore critical gaps in One Health surveillance integration, rational antimicrobial use in the food chain, and the need for robust AMR research governance. Despite progress in different areas, the overall implementation revealed significant challenges, particularly in research, multi-sectoral collaboration, and the One Health integration. Future action should prioritize a unified national AMR policy framework for strategic planning, emphasizing resource distribution, active participation of all relevant sectors, and institutionalizing systematic monitoring and evaluation to inform policymaking. Strengthening coordination between human, animal, and environmental sectors is essential to achieving a robust, One Health-aligned AMR response in Jordan.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40783727/,10.1186/s12889-025-24073-5

Conventionally, HAP/VAP patients are given broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics at clinical diagnosis, refined after 48-72 h, once microbiology results become available. Molecular tests offer swifter results, potentially improving patient care. To investigate whether this potential is realisable, we conducted a pragmatic multi-centre RCT ('INHALE WP3') of rapid, syndromic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in ICU HAP/VAP compared with standard of care. As the use of molecular tests impact on hospital resources, it is important to consider their potential value-for-money to make fully informed decisions. Consequently, INHALE WP3 included an economic evaluation, presented here. Its aim was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of an in-ICU PCR (bioMérieux BioFire FilmArray Pneumonia Panel) in HAP/VAP, informing whether to implement such technology in routine NHS care. We collected data on patient resource use and costs. These data were combined with INHALE WP3's two primary outcome measures: antibiotic stewardship at 24 h and clinical cure at 14 days. Cost-effectiveness analyses were carried out using regression models adjusting for site. Sensitivity analyses explored assumptions and sub-group analyses explored differential impacts. We found lower total ICU costs (including PCR costs) in the intervention (PCR-guided therapy) group. Average costs were £40,951 for standard of care compared with £33,149 for the intervention group, a difference of - £7,802 (95% CI: - £15,696, £92). For antibiotic stewardship, the PCR-guided therapy was both less costly and more effective than routine patient management. For clinical cure, we did not find PCR-guided therapy to be cost-effective due to fewer cases being cured in the intervention group. We found lower average ICU costs with the Pneumonia Panel. The pneumonia panel was cost-effective in terms of antibiotic stewardship, but not clinical cure.

These wounds not only prolong hospital stays and increase healthcare costs but also significantly impair rehabilitation outcomes and quality of life. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the pathophysiology and risk factors underlying pressure injury development, emphasizing the unique vulnerabilities of patients with sensory loss, malnutrition, obesity, and incontinence. It synthesizes current best practices in prevention, including repositioning schedules, the use of pressure-redistributing support surfaces, moisture control, and nutritional optimization. The role of risk assessment tools such as the Braden Scale is examined alongside newer technologies like pressure mapping systems, Artificial intelligence-based prediction algorithms and biofeedback tools enhance individualization of care. Pharmacologic strategies and wound management principles, including debridement and antimicrobial use, are discussed in the context of multidisciplinary rehabilitation. Implementation challenges such as staffing constraints, variability across care settings, and financial limitations are addressed, and future directions are proposed to better integrate skin integrity metrics into functional outcome measures. Ultimately, this review advocates for a proactive, interdisciplinary approach that aligns preventive strategies with personalized care and emerging technology, positioning pressure injury prevention as a core component of high-quality, value-based medicine.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40778001/,10.26502/jsr.10020455

Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) are vital tools that support AMS programs. Guidance MS, a CDSS developed in 2005, has been implemented in over 60 Australian hospitals, yielding positive outcomes such as reduced gram-negative resistance, decreased antimicrobial consumption, and improved prescribing practices. This CDSS was redesigned to continue to support national AMS accreditation standards and meet evolving needs in digital healthcare. The CDSS included features for formulary restriction, clinical decision support, post-prescription review, auditing, and interactive reports for feedback. This paper outlines how the Learning Health System (LHS) framework was applied to redesign, develop, implement and evaluate the updated CDSS. The LHS framework operates through iterative cycles of practice-to-data, data-to-knowledge, and knowledge-to-practice. A Learning Health Community was established, which provided input to guide system design. Key considerations for the new CDSS included a user-centred approach, interoperability with electronic medical records (EMR), and adherence to national regulatory standards for Software As a Medical Device. Following an Agile development process, the redesigned system underwent extensive testing and iterative improvements. The program was then implemented in a beta site, a large, tertiary hospital. Extensive User Acceptance Testing was conducted, with feedback and improvements incorporated into the first version release. The program was then implemented in a network of thirteen hospitals. Formal and anecdotal feedback from the project team and clinicians showed high satisfaction regarding usability, performance, clinician workflow improvement, content quality, and efficiency. The LHS framework enabled user feedback to drive rapid enhancements to the program, ensuring it met identified needs. The implementation projects provided valuable insights into workflows, enhancing project delivery and informing strategies for future application improvements and scalability. Future development will include establishing two-way integration with EMRs and mobile devices. A socio-technical evaluation will assess the program's perceived usability and usefulness, supporting continuous improvement as part of LHS methodology. A formal evaluation will assess clinical impact on hospital and patient outcomes, providing evidence to guide ongoing optimisation.The LHS is a useful framework for designing, developing, implementing and evaluating digital healthcare solutions for AMS, which continues to inform improvements, enabling provision of an effective, scalable and sustainable, digital solution.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40775863/,10.3233/SHTI250845

This study introduces a novel clinicopathological perspective on jawbone destruction linked to E. gingivalis and Actinomyces co-infection, aiming to improve diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we tried to evaluate minimally invasive methods for improving diagnosis and treatment for jawbone destruction, possibly linked to E. gingivalis and Actinomyces co-infection. We analyzed 11 cases of jawbone destructive lesions observed in patients (ages 42 to 83, both female and male) who visited Tohoku University Hospital from January 2015 to December 2021, in which scraping cytology detected E. gingivalis and Actinomyces. We thoroughly assessed clinical symptoms, imaging findings, and treatment outcomes, including the duration of antimicrobial therapy, to identify distinctive patterns associated with this co-infection. On imaging, patients exhibited significant mandibular resorption and sclerosis, despite the absence of typical symptoms of osteomyelitis or actinomycosis. Notably, E. gingivalis alone was linked to faster wound healing and shorter antimicrobial therapy durations compared to cases with concurrent Actinomyces infection (p = 0.011). The use of minimally invasive procedures, focusing on removing necrotic bone and loose teeth, led to effective healing and rapid recovery across all cases, offering promising prospects for enhanced treatment outcomes. This study underscores the value of scraping cytology for early identification of E. gingivalis and Actinomyces in jawbone lesions. Early detection and targeted intervention can prevent disease progression, enhance patient outcomes, and optimize antimicrobial use. These findings highlight the need for increased awareness of microbial co-infections in jaw osteomyelitis and support a new clinicopathological approach to diagnosis and management.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40775633/,10.1186/s13005-025-00535-4

This prospective study examines ten-year trends, clinical features, and genomic epidemiology of hospital-onset (HOI) and non-hospital-onset (non-HOI, including healthcare-associated [HcAI] and community-acquired [CA]) KPC-KP infections following a 2012 outbreak. We evaluated the impacts of a 2014 antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) and COVID-19-related infection prevention and control (IPC) measures, with emphasis on hospital-to-community dissemination. We analysed a prospective, longitudinal cohort of patients (2012-2022) in a tertiary referral hospital. Interrupted time series and ARIMA models assessed ASP and IPC impacts on incidence density (ID). Cross-correlation analysis explored temporal associations between HOI and non-HOI trends. Whole-genome sequencing and PERMANOVA evaluated the genomic structure of ST512/KPC-3 isolates. Multivariable regression analysed the association between infection type and clinical outcomes. Among 467 patients, 33.2% had non-HOI (ID 0.53/1,000 admissions/month) and 66.8% HOI (ID 0.30, p = 0.39). Urinary tract infections predominated in non-HOI (52.9%), while bloodstream and respiratory infections were more common in HOI. Incidence density of HOI and non-HOI infections declined significantly following ASP implementation, with a 4-month lag suggesting sequential transmission dynamics. These reductions were maintained during the pandemic. Genomic data confirmed ST512/KPC-3 dominance and hospital-to-community spread, with temporal factors-rather than acquisition type-explaining genetic variation. Adjusted analyses showed similar 30-day mortality and treatment responses across HOI and non-HOI. ASP and COVID-19 IPC measures contributed to maintaining low KPC-KP incidence. Genomic evidence underscores the role of temporal dynamics and clonal expansion in ST512/KPC-3 dissemination.

Since 2023, it has been mandatory to collect and report data on antibiotic use per animal species or subcategory of species for cattle, pigs, chickens and turkeys in all EU and EEA countries. Norway collects data on use of medicines for animals through the Norwegian Veterinary Prescription Register (VetReg). It is mandatory for veterinarians to report the use of all medicines for food-producing animals and for pharmacies to report to VetReg all medicines dispensed to animal owners for all animal species and to veterinarians. The aim of our study was to evaluate the quality of antibiotic VetReg data for 2023, focusing on the information required to fulfill reporting of use data in accordance with the EU-requirements. The quality attributes, accuracy of data and timeliness of reporting, were evaluated using VetReg data, and completeness was evaluated by comparing VetReg data with sales statistics from wholesalers. In general, accuracy varied between the variables and within a variable, depending on whether veterinarians or pharmacies were the data source. For example, 97% of veterinary records included the required subcategory of the animal species, while only 17% of the pharmacy's records did. Antibiotic use data in VetReg were calculated to cover 85% of the antibiotics sold by wholesaler to pharmacies. Timeliness also varied - i.e. pharmacies reported almost immediately after dispensing, while 29% of veterinary records were not reported within the deadline of seven days. Antibiotic use data for animals in Norway in 2023 could be reported to EMA using VetReg data. The data were, however, not fully accurate and complete. This study revealed several specific accuracy issues and issues with timeliness of reporting.

The most commonly self-medicated antibiotics were amoxicillin 134 (51.3%), ampiclox 87 (33.3%) and metronidazole 57 (21.9%). Participants with previous successful treatment were 2.33 times more likely to self-medicate (PR = 2.33, 95% CI: 1.89-2.87, P < 0.001) while poor staff attitude increased the likelihood by 1.53 times (PR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.38-1.71, P < 0.001). Knowledge about antibiotics was negatively associated with ASM in that those who had knowledge on antibiotics were 25% less likely to self-medicate with antibiotics (PR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.65-0.86, P < 0.001). The practice of antibiotic self-medication was highly prevalent in Otuke district due to previous successful treatments and poor health care systems. The commonly self-medicated antibiotics were amoxicillin, ampiclox and metronidazole.

40772992,Can We Lower the Burden of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) in Heavily Immunocompromised Patients? A Narrative Review and Call to Action.,"Bassetti M, Cardone A, Cardoso F, Carter V, Cornely OA, Falcone M, Gallego D, Giannella M, Grossi PA, Pagano L, Silvestris N, Sipsas NV, Soriano A, Tumbarello M, Viale P",2025,Infectious diseases and therapy,"Effective antibiotics are a cornerstone of treatment for heavily immunocompromised patients such as those undergoing cancer treatment or transplantation procedures, as these patients are at particularly high risk of adverse outcomes from infections. However, rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threatens to undermine our ability to deliver modern treatments, and without action, recent advances in clinical care may be undone. In this narrative review, we examine the broad burdens of AMR for patients and healthcare systems, including excess mortality, underlying disease outcomes, economic costs and the damage to patients' quality of life. Despite the profound impact on individual wellbeing, the patient voice and patient-reported experience measures are largely absent from current research. To protect the everyday benefits of antibiotics, it is vital to educate all those involved in patient care on how we can combat AMR, including appropriate testing, use of effective antibiotics and infection control procedures. Moreover, given the high investment in novel anticancer treatments, good antimicrobial stewardship has the potential to deliver overall cost savings to healthcare systems while ensuring that patients can safely access and benefit from these therapies. Antibiotics are essential for people with serious health conditions like cancer or those who have received an organ transplant. These patients have weakened immune systems and are more likely to develop infections; however, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), where bacteria no longer respond to antibiotics, is making these infections harder to treat. This review looked at the impact of AMR in heavily immunocompromised patients. It found that resistant infections are common and can cause delays to cancer treatment, longer hospital stays and a higher risk of death. These infections can also reduce quality of life and increase healthcare costs. The review found that current efforts to manage AMR are inconsistent. There is a need for faster diagnostic testing, better education for healthcare providers and patients, and more consistent use of infection control and antibiotic stewardship programmes. These steps could help optimise the treatment of resistant bacteria and improve outcomes. As treatments like chemotherapy and organ transplantation are very costly, preventing infections and early mortality through better AMR management could also help reduce overall healthcare spending. The review highlights the importance of improving awareness, strengthening hospital systems and investing in new antibiotics so that patients continue to benefit from modern medical treatments.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40772992/,10.1007/s40121-025-01204-4

This study examined the effects of prebiotic supplementation on GI symptoms and HRQOL. An open-label, randomised controlled trial involving two phases. In Phase 1, children aged 1-18 years with IF received supplementation with a blend of prebiotics for 4 weeks. In Phase 2, participants were randomised to either continue supplementation or cease supplementation for 6 months to evaluate long-term effects. Primary end points included parent-reported GI symptoms and HRQOL, measured by PedsQL™ scales. Secondary end points were stool consistency and frequency, nutritional support and antibiotic use. Out of 47 children completing Phase 1, 43 completed Phase 2 (24 in the intervention group, 19 in the control group). After 4 weeks, 60% reported reduced GI symptoms. By the end of Phase 2, the intervention group showed no significant changes in HRQOL score, but significant GI symptom improvements compared to controls (mean paediatric quality of life inventory GI score difference of 6.9, p = 0.01). Stool frequency decreased (median -1.0 vs. 0 stools/day, p = 0.003), and stool consistency normalised more frequently in the intervention group (42% vs. 6%, p = 0.02). No significant changes were noted in nutritional support or antibiotic use.

40767777,The role of microbiological results in driving inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions.,"Munoz P, Vena A, Burillo A, Bouza E",2025,Current opinion in critical care,"To highlight the unintended consequences of microbiological test results in driving inappropriate antimicrobial prescriptions, and to evaluate strategies - particularly from the perspective of diagnostic stewardship - that may mitigate this issue. Despite the critical role of microbiological data in guiding appropriate antimicrobial therapy, several studies have demonstrated that misinterpretation of such results frequently leads to unnecessary treatments. Common pitfalls include overinterpretation of positive cultures from poorly collected or clinically unwarranted samples, misclassification of colonization vs. infection, and excessive reliance on test results in the absence of supporting clinical evidence. Emerging diagnostic stewardship interventions - ranging from restricting sample processing and modifying test reporting to implementing decision support tools - have shown promising outcomes in reducing overtreatment without compromising patient safety. Specific examples include urine and wound cultures, respiratory specimens, and the diagnosis of Clostridioides difficile infection. Furthermore, educational and system-level strategies such as the BLADDER score or selective result reporting can improve decision-making at various stages of the diagnostic process. Microbiology laboratories play a pivotal role in antimicrobial stewardship and must actively support clinicians in avoiding diagnostic and therapeutic errors. While evidence supports multiple approaches to mitigate inappropriate prescriptions driven by microbiology results, their successful implementation requires interdisciplinary collaboration, tailored interventions, and ongoing evaluation of clinical impact. Diagnostic stewardship, when aligned with clinician education and robust reporting practices, is a crucial component in enhancing the accuracy of infection diagnosis and reducing antimicrobial overuse.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40767777/,10.1097/MCC.0000000000001314

This quality improvement study utilized data from the Collaboration to Harmonize Antimicrobial Registry Measures (CHARM) database, which integrates antibiotic prescribing data extracted from the EHRs of various outpatient facilities. The study was conducted across 352 outpatient facilities in the United States. The study included oral antibiotic prescribing data from outpatient encounters from January 2021 to June 2023, encompassing 823,938 prescriptions. The primary outcomes were the rate of antibiotic prescribing per 1 000 prescription-related outpatient visits and identifying frequently prescribed antibiotics in adults and children. Secondary outcomes were the prescribing patterns for selected diagnoses and the concordance of these prescriptions with published guidelines. The study estimated approximately a 20% increase in antibiotic prescribing per year, with an overall rate of 121.26 prescriptions per 1 000 prescription-related outpatient visits (95% confidence interval 121.01-121.50). Amoxicillin-clavulanate, amoxicillin, doxycycline, and cephalexin were most frequently prescribed. Sinusitis and otitis media were the most common reasons for prescribing antibiotics among adults and children, respectively. Less than 60% of sinusitis-related prescriptions were antibiotic concordant. Duration concordance rates were less than 70% for sinusitis, urinary tract infections, cellulitis, and Group A Streptococci. 51% of ciprofloxacin prescriptions were for patients aged 60 or older.

We performed a retrospective analysis of systemic antibiotic administration in fire-affected koalas admitted to two wildlife treatment facilities during the catastrophic Australian wildfires in 2019-2020, to assess the practice of antimicrobial stewardship during a wildlife emergency. Triage and treatment records were obtained for fire-affected koalas (n = 355) admitted to two facilities during the wildfires. Analyses showed that 40.3% of koalas at Facility A and 35.0% of koalas at Facility B received systemic antibiotics. The majority of antibiotics (63.9%, comprising multiple types of beta-lactams) administered to koalas at Facility A were prophylactic treatments in koalas with noninfected moderate to severe cutaneous burn wounds. The majority of antibiotics (75.0%, comprising chloramphenicol and enrofloxacin) administered to koalas at Facility B were chlamydial disease treatments. Overall, 29.4% of all antibiotic treatments (predominantly beta-lactams and enrofloxacin) were administered for recorded clinical infections. Where koala-specific guidelines and protocols for treating burn wounds were not available, there was an overuse of systemic antibiotics and frequently sub-optimal antibiotic stewardship in burnt koalas during the 2019-2020 wildfire emergency response. Best practice antibiotic prescribing was also not always feasible due to a shortage of first-choice antibiotics (e.g., injectable chloramphenicol for chlamydial disease).

To this end, we developed and validated a machine learning (ML) model to assess the effectiveness of PIPT in the treatment of septic lower respiratory tract infections and to explore relevant influencing factors. The study was based on data from hospitalized patients treated with PIPT, and a dataset of bacterial lower respiratory tract infections was constructed by retrospective analysis and divided into training and testing sets in a 7:3 ratio. After screening the key predictors using least absolute shrinkage and Least Absolute Shrink age and Selection Operator regression methods, 5 ML models, including logistic regression and random forest, were used to train these factors to predict efficacy. Model interpretation was performed using the SHapley Additive exPlanations technique. The results showed that the decision tree model had a performance score of 0.73 (95% CI 0.61-0.86) for prediction. The SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis identified several important factors for treatment failure, including low serum albumin levels, reduced drug dosage, and comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart failure, in addition to an unfavorable neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of ≥70%. This study demonstrates that the ML model is effective in predicting the outcome of PIPT therapy and helps to personalize medical regimens while adjusting strategies by identifying high-risk individuals, ultimately achieving the dual goals of optimizing patient care and reducing inappropriate antibiotic use.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40760596/,10.1097/MD.0000000000043460

We aimed to assess the impact of these changes on antibiotic prescriptions for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus infections. This retrospective before-after study included adult inpatients with monobacterial infections between March-August 2021 (BEFORE) and March-August 2022 (AFTER). Antibiotic use and relevance were compared. Meropenem was masked when imipenem was categorized as SFP. We included 240 antibiotic susceptibility tests (195 patients). Infectious disease consultations increased significantly during implementation (53.0 % vs. 28.9 %, p = 0.0005). Meropenem prescriptions for P. aeruginosa declined (13.8 %-6.2 %), while high-dose regimens for SFP antibiotics likewise decreased (50.0 %-35.4 %). Overall, prescription appropriateness remained high (>92 %). The introduction of SFP reporting was associated with increased ID consultation and a trend toward reduced broad-spectrum use, highlighting a need for targeted prescriber education.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40759337/,10.1016/j.idnow.2025.105130
40759336,Artificial intelligence and infectious diseases: Scope and perspectives.,"Abbara S, Crabol Y, de Bouillé JG, Dinh A, Morquin D, None None",2025,Infectious diseases now,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to permeate every facet of infectious disease practice-from prevention and public health surveillance to epidemic management and bedside care. Routine care data (laboratory results, medication orders, progress notes) and research-generated datasets now fuel state-of-the-art machine-learning (ML) pipelines that sharpen diagnosis, prognosis, antimicrobial stewardship, and, by combining both sources, accelerate drug discovery. In diagnostics, deep networks that now flag pneumonia or tuberculosis on chest images are increasingly able to identify-and localize-virtually more infectious processes throughout the body, while simultaneously predicting pathogen identity and antimicrobial resistance from routine microbiology. Prognostic models trained on Electronic Health Records surpass traditional scores in anticipating clinical deterioration or postoperative sepsis, enabling earlier targeted interventions. Predictive analytics can also personalize antimicrobial dosing by fusing real-time drug-monitoring data. Large language models (LLMs) build upon these advances by transforming unstructured clinical narratives into structured phenotypes suitable for predictive modeling, automatically summarizing patient encounters, generating synthetic cohorts for rare conditions, and providing real-time conversational decision support at the patient's bedside. Despite rapid progress, real-world deployment faces hurdles: high computational and licensing costs, vendor-specific implementation constraints, limited cross-site model transferability, and fragmented governance of safety, bias, and cybersecurity risks. Rigorous, lifecycle-based evaluation frameworks-covering external validation, cost-effectiveness analysis, and post-deployment monitoring-are required to ensure safe, equitable, and sustainable AI adoption. This review synthesizes current applications, evidential strengths, and unresolved challenges, and proposes a translational roadmap aligning technical innovation with clinical and regulatory realities.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40759336/,10.1016/j.idnow.2025.105131

We created a multidisciplinary clinical care guideline for management of infants with gastroschisis. The aim of the current work is twofold: 1. Determine effectiveness of our implementation strategy and 2. Determine the association between guideline use and clinical outcomes. We conducted a retrospective review of infants diagnosed with gastroschisis at a single level IV NICU from 2010 to 2024. Provider utilization of four elements of the protocol (no elective intubation for sutureless closure or silo placement, no antibiotic prophylaxis with silo in place, central venous access within 48 h, selenium supplementation in TPN) were assessed. Patient outcomes and rates of complications were compared between pre- and post-protocol groups. There were 126 infants included (n = 86 pre-protocol, n = 40 post-protocol). After adjusting for covariates, rate of antibiotic prophylaxis decreased (p < 0.001) and selenium supplementation in TPN increased (p = 0.002). Use of bedside silo and sutureless closure increased (p = 0.02, p < 0.001) with a corresponding decrease in operative fascial closure (p < 0.001). Time to feed initiation and exposure to general anesthesia decreased (p < 0.001, p < 0.001), though time to full feeds and hospital length of stay (LOS) increased (p < 0.001, p < 0.001). There were no differences in complication rates including infection, unplanned reoperation, and readmission between groups. Implementation of a standardized pathway for infants with gastroschisis was associated with decreased antibiotic use and general anesthesia exposure without increasing rates of complications.

40758739,Injury reporting in elite ladies Gaelic football and camogie: Perspectives of athlete support personnel.,"Gilhooly M, Cahalan R, O'Sullivan K, Norton C",2025,PloS one,"This study investigates athlete support personnel's (ASP) perspectives on injury reporting among elite ladies' Gaelic football and camogie players. ASP refers to individuals in coaching, management, and allied health and performance related practice. A mixed-methods design was employed, comprising an online survey and follow-up interviews. Forty-two ASP, currently or recently (within two years) involved in elite ladies' Gaelic games, completed the survey. Eighteen ASP subsequently participated in semi-structured interviews. Quantitative survey data were analysed using frequency analysis, while interview transcripts were subjected to framework analysis. A significant proportion of ASP (43%, n = 18) believe that players do not report all injuries. Most respondents (95%, n = 40) agreed that players often avoid reporting injuries to prevent losing playing time, while 95% (n = 40) cited player fear of being side-lined as a key factor. Furthermore, 93% (n = 39) agreed that players are more likely to report injuries when immediate access to medical personnel, such as team doctors or physiotherapists, is available. Notably, 66% (n = 28) disagreed with the perception that managers view players as weak for reporting injuries, while 19% (n = 8) agreed with this notion. Qualitative findings corroborated these results and identified three overarching themes influencing injury reporting: player factors, system-driven influences, and environmental conditions. Individual factors included a competitive environment that prioritised maintaining team position over health, with experienced players exhibiting greater confidence in reporting injuries compared to younger players, who often perceived management as hierarchical and less approachable. Immediate, consistent access to physiotherapists and other medical professionals was highlighted as a critical enabler of injury reporting. Trust in ASP, built through visible involvement and positive relationships, emerged as a key determinant. Additionally, a supportive team culture that prioritises player well-being alongside performance outcomes was identified as essential for encouraging open injury reporting. Injury underreporting is a significant issue among elite ladies' Gaelic games players, driven by personal, system-level, and environmental factors. Of critical importance for teams and organisations is to provide education for players and ASP on the importance and value of injury reporting to support early and appropriate intervention. Concurrently providing improved medical access will help to foster stronger, trust-based relationships between players and ASP, considered crucial for improving injury reporting practices.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40758739/,10.1371/journal.pone.0329679 10.1080/1612197x.2023.2257214 10.1016/j.jsams.2022.10.007 10.3928/19425864-20200426-01 10.1186/s13102-022-00553-8 10.1123/tsp.2023-0074 10.1080/2159676x.2022.2086166 10.1123/jsr.2024-0181 10.1007/s40279-017-0815-y 10.1136/bmjsem-2017-000315 10.1123/jsr.2019-0468 10.1136/bmjsem-2021-001094 10.1177/0363546518825380 10.1136/bjsports-2015-094847 10.1016/j.ptsp.2018.11.007 10.1186/s40798-023-00603-6 10.26504/rs76 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2012.10.271 10.4085/1062-6050-52.1.07 10.46743/1540-580x/2020.1908 10.1186/s40798-019-0189-9 10.1136/bmjsem-2017-000317 10.1080/14413523.2023.2284987 10.1177/19417381221139338 10.1123/wspaj.2024-0117 10.1002/tsm2.53 10.1136/bjsports-2019-100773 10.1123/tsp.19.1.18 10.3390/socsci8090255 10.1080/1612197x.2021.1919742 10.1136/eb-2017-102699 10.1016/j.ptsp.2022.07.001 10.1123/jcsp.2019-0022 10.1123/ssj.22.4.433 10.1080/24733938.2023.2290077 10.1080/24733938.2021.1985164 10.1123/tsp.2016-0052 10.1080/2159676x.2019.1704846 10.1080/13645579.2016.1195588 10.1186/1471-2288-13-117 10.1177/1035719X211058251 10.7748/nr2011.01.18.2.52.c8284 10.1097/acm.0000000000000388 10.1016/j.jsams.2022.07.001 10.1080/02701367.2020.1865517 10.1080/17461391.2018.1440009 10.1136/bjsports-2017-098001 10.1016/j.ptsp.2022.12.008 10.1371/journal.pone.0281825 10.1136/bjsm.2008.056069 10.1136/bjsports-2020-103159 10.1136/bjsports-2022-106548 10.1136/bjsports-2020-102514 10.1177/14413582241264619
40758736,The impact of antimicrobial stewardship interventions on surgical antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines compliance in a teaching hospital in Ghana.,"Sefah IA, Chetty S, Yamoah P, Bangalee V",2025,PloS one,"Inappropriate use of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP) to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs) is noted to be a major contributor of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) globally, including Ghana. This study sought to assess the impact of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) interventions on SAP guideline compliance and other surgical outcomes including SSI and length of hospital stay. This was a nine-month quasi-experimental (before- and after-intervention) study. Four months' medical records of 150 obstetric and gynecological surgery patients were collected both before (baseline) and after the implementation of AMS interventions in a teaching hospital in Ghana. The interventions included education on the hospital SAP guidelines and feedback of the baseline survey results to the surgical team. An adapted data collection sheet was used to collect medical records of the included patients. A descriptive analysis was performed, a Pearson's chi-square test and a two-sample Wilcoxon (Mann-Whitney U) rank-sum test were used to assess the impact of the interventions. Most (n = 220/300, 73.33%) of the patients were between the ages of 24-44 years, and the commonest surgery was an emergency caesarean section (n = 92/300, 30.67%). After the AMS interventions, there was a significant improvement in guideline compliance due to appropriate antibiotic choice (p = 0.001). duration (p < 0.001), and the volume of consumption of SAP (p < 0.001). There were no significant changes in the timing of administration (p = 0.636), SSI rate (p = 0.054), and the length of hospital stay (p = 0.161). Our study showed positive impact of the two AMS interventions on SAP guideline compliance based on the choice and duration of prescription, and reduction of the volume of antibiotic utilization, but not on the timing of administration. This did not worsen the SSI rate and patient length of stay. Hospitals in Ghana and beyond are encouraged to optimize SAP use and prevent rising AMR rates by implementing appropriate educational programmes and dissemination of audit findings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40758736/,10.1371/journal.pone.0329541 10.1016/s0140-6736(24)01076-6 10.55522/ijti.v2i2.0030 10.1371/journal.pone.0301531 10.2147/idr.s290835 10.1016/j.mcna.2018.05.011 10.1093/intqhc/mzab089 10.4102/sajid.v36i1.307 10.1016/j.jhin.2022.07.031 10.1371/journal.pone.0213395 10.1371/journal.pone.0078942 10.1016/j.jiph.2019.05.015

We evaluated whether season-tailored multiplex PCR panels accelerate pathogen identification and improve antibiotic stewardship. In a single-center, prospective study, adults with radiographically confirmed pneumonia were enrolled consecutively and allocated by a rotating week-on/week-off schedule to either a seasonal PCR panel or conventional diagnostics. Primary outcomes were (i) time to final pathogen report and (ii) diagnostic yield (≥ 1 pathogen detected). Secondary outcomes included empiric-antibiotic appropriateness within 24 h, regimen changes ≤ 72 h, antibiotic duration, length of stay (LOS) and 30-day mortality. Among 282 analyzable patients (spring = 140; autumn-winter = 142), PCR slashed turnaround time from 48 h to 12 h in spring and from 50 h to 14 h in autumn-winter (median difference - 36 h, 95% CI: - 42 to - 30; p < 0.001).

Managing risk of harm is fraught with uncertainties: patients may not always be truly allergic and medical records may not be accurate. The aim of this study was to investigate how conversations about drug allergy risks unfold when prescribing for common infections. We screened 156 acute primary care consultations for adult patients presenting with upper respiratory concerns in England and Sweden to identify all cases where drug allergies were raised. Data are in British English and Swedish. We used conversation-analytic methods to make systematic observations on how the topic was initiated; the activity context; the patient's response and any subsequent mention of drug allergy; identifying recurrent patterns within and across the two datasets. In both datasets, drug allergies were raised in just over one third of consultations most often via questions conveying a bias towards a 'no allergy' outcome. When asked during information-gathering, the question was sometimes misunderstood as asking about allergies in general. In the majority of cases, no allergies were reported, yet patients often qualified their 'no allergy' answers displaying uncertainty. Patients who did report allergies were seldom questioned about the nature of their symptoms. Where patient allergy status was contested or neglected by doctors and brought to the interactional surface, work was done by both parties to maintain neutrality or display cautiousness around different territories of knowledge. Our analysis reveals common interactional problems faced by prescribing professionals when managing the risk of patient harm from drug allergies when recommending antimicrobials.

40750850,"Antimicrobial prescribing patterns among pediatric outpatient encounters in primary healthcare centers in Bujumbura Mairie, Burundi.","Manirakiza A, Maru SM, Nyamu DG, Bizimana T, Nimpagaritse M",2025,BMC primary care,"Understanding prescribing patterns is essential for developing targeted interventions to promote rational antimicrobial use. This study evaluated antimicrobial prescribing patterns among pediatric outpatients at primary healthcare centers (PHCs) in Bujumbura Mairie, republic of Burundi. We conducted a cross-sectional study at 20 PHCs in Bujumbura Mairie, Republic of Burundi, to evaluate antimicrobial prescribing patterns. We collected retrospectively 2022-year data from medical records using the World Health Organization/International Network of Rational Use of Drugs (WHO/INRUD) core drug indicators. According to these WHO guidelines, a minimum sample size of 600 prescriptions is recommended to assess drug use indicators. To meet this requirement, a total of 800 paediatric outpatient prescriptions were sampled. Prescriptions for inpatients were excluded. A total of 497 (62.1%) out of 800 prescriptions contained antimicrobials, far exceeding WHO recommendations (20-26.8%). Younger patients, particularly children under five, received the highest proportion of antimicrobial prescriptions (15.6%). Although generic prescribing (95.0%) and adherence to the National Essential Medicine Lists (NEML) (95.8%) were high, they fell short of WHO benchmarks (100%). Most prescriptions followed monotherapy (92.8%) with a low average of 1.1 antimicrobials per prescription (WHO guidelines 1.6-1.8). Although Access-group dominated (71.3%), Watch-group usage (25.3%) surpassed the recommended threshold (< 20%), and WHO non-recommended fixed-dose combinations were also prescribed (3.4%). In addition, 26.2% of prescriptions lacked documented indications. The present study highlights strong adherence to essential medicine lists and generic antimicrobial use. However, findings also reveal areas for improvement, including the need for documentation of indication and reduction of utilization of Watch group antibiotic use. To optimize antimicrobial use and prevent AMR in Burundi's paediatric population, further national research, healthcare worker training, diagnostics, and antimicrobial stewardship implementation are necessary.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40750850/,10.1186/s12875-025-02944-5

Optimizing antimicrobial use by rationalizing indications and the duration of administration is essential against the ever-growing threat of antimicrobial resistance. The aim of our study was to reveal the current habits of prophylactic antimicrobial use among veterinarians who perform transvascular cardiac interventions in dogs. A digital survey was offered via the mailing list of an international veterinary cardiology-interest group. The 141 respondents reported large variations in protocols (e.g., 47 different prophylaxis protocols for pacemaker implantation). Protocols differed on administration (yes/no), drug, and the route and duration of administration (only intravenous, or intravenous followed by oral antimicrobials). The median duration of antimicrobial course was 7 days (range: 0-21 days). Antimicrobial prophylaxis was administered by 89 % of 141 respondents for occlusion of patent ductus arteriosus, 76 % of 139 respondents for balloon valvuloplasty of pulmonary valve stenosis, 93 % of 56 respondents for transpulmonary stenting, and 96 % of 136 respondents for transvenous pacemaker implantation. The existence of institutional guidelines was reported by 30 % of the respondents, although these also showed substantial variation (e.g., 27 guidelines from 40 institutions for pacemaker implantation). Veterinarians use prophylactic antimicrobials more often and for longer periods for cardiac interventions than their human counterparts. Antibiotic prophylaxis shows little consistency between veterinarians, and does not appear to be supported by evidence of necessity. This warrants re-evaluation of use, and creation of guidelines describing rational use of antimicrobials in interventional cardiac procedures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40749449/,10.1016/j.vetmic.2025.110656

Biofilm formation on indwelling catheters by multidrug-resistant uropathogens further complicates treatment and prevention, underscoring the urgent need for alternative, non-antibiotic solutions. This article explores the potential of bacteriophage- and enzybiotic-coated urinary catheters as an innovative strategy to prevent recurrent bacterial infections. We review the clinical significance of biofilm formation on the surface of urinary catheters, the role of phages and their lytic enzymes in disrupting biofilms, and the clinical evidence supporting the efficacy of phage therapy. The reference list was compiled through a structured search of peer-reviewed studies and case reports, particularly from recent years, available in the PubMed database. Phage- and enzybiotic-functionalized catheters represent a promising non-antibiotic approach to CAUTI prevention. These biological agents offer targeted antibacterial activity, disrupt biofilms, and reduce the risk of drug resistance development. Their integration into catheter design may significantly improve infection control, reduce antibiotic use, and align with global antimicrobial stewardship goals. However, clinical standardization and regulatory clarity are crucial for advancing their implementation in routine clinical practice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40747965/,10.1080/14787210.2025.2541717

Colonized bile is well known to increase the risk of SSIs after pancreatoduodenectomy. However, AMS programs seem to reduce their occurrence. This observational before-after study included patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy from 2015 to 2022 at a high-volume pancreatic center (#NCT04199494). Pre-AMS data spanned from January 2015 to November 2019, and post-AMS data from December 2019 to October 2022. Intraoperative bile samples were analyzed for microbiology. The AMS program involved preoperative rectal screening for multidrug-resistant bacteria to guide personalized surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP). Tailored SAP was used for patients colonized with resistant pathogens. SSI rates, length of stay, major and pancreatic surgery-specific complications, and mortality were assessed using standard statistics. Of 1638 patients included, 1321 (80.6%) had intraoperative bile sampling, with 909 samples (68.8%) testing positive for colonization. The most common bacteria were Enterobacterales (75%), 18% extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing, and Enterococci (60%), 4% of which were vancomycin-resistant. Colonized bile was associated with male sex, jaundice, biliary stenting, and positive rectal screening ( P < 0.05). Before AMS, colonized bile correlated with higher SSI rates (38% vs 31%, P = 0.008). Post-AMS, no significant difference was observed (29% vs 28%, P = 0.5). Tailored SAP reduced overall SSI (34% reduction, P = 0.002) and superficial SSI (59% reduction, P = 0.011).

The aim of this study was to describe how utilizing antibiotics for children under five years of age in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is experienced by various healthcare providers. A phenomenographic approach was employed to analyse data from individual interviews with 14 healthcare workers of the Eastern DRC, including medical doctors, nurses and practicing pharmacists. Two overarching themes with their corresponding categories emerged: “Factors influencing antibiotic use” and “Operating within a weak healthcare system”. Healthcare providers consistently described widespread self-medication practices in children, driven largely by financial constraints within the population. Although many providers recognized the risks associated with inappropriate antibiotic use, their decisions were heavily influenced by systemic limitations and community expectations. A major concern raised was the increasing failure of antibiotics in treatment. This study highlights the complex factors shaping antibiotic use and prescription practices in Eastern DRC, where healthcare workers operate within a fragmented healthcare system. Addressing antibiotic resistance in such settings requires coordinated local and global efforts focused on promoting responsible antibiotic use, strengthening healthcare infrastructure, providing continuous education, establishing national guidelines, and improving community awareness and access to quality care.

In Australia, antibiotics are frequently prescribed in general practice (primary care) settings for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) despite these infections most commonly being caused by viruses. The Optimal Implementation of Antimicrobial Stewardship in General Practice (OptimasGP) study aims to provide implementation support for effective antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) interventions for ARIs. The current study will examine if a redesigned workflow, and an AMS Toolbox containing AMS resources, is an acceptable way to access AMS interventions and clinical data collected in general practice settings. A mixed-methods approach will be applied using a single-arm, pragmatic exploratory study. Data will be collected for a period of 3 months. Data collection from general practice settings in New South Wales, Australia, will involve the participation of 4 to 6 practices, 12 general practitioners (GPs), and 6 to 8 practice staff. We also aim to recruit 50-100 patients to complete surveys and 12 patients to participate in focus group discussions. Participating GPs and practice staff will be provided with an online AMS Toolbox to facilitate access to AMS resources. Two hours of online training and a reminder card will also be provided. The AMS Toolbox will contain AMS resources for shared decision-making, clinical decision support (including point-of-care testing), and delayed antibiotic prescribing in patients with ARIs. The primary outcome of the study will be the acceptability of the AMS Toolbox to GPs, practice staff, and patients.

40735513,"Trends in antibiotic dispensing for children in Belgian ambulatory care: time series analysis before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Dillen H, Van de Velde A, Withofs C, Wynants L, Verbakel JY",2025,JAC-antimicrobial resistance,"The aim of this study is to analyse trends in paediatric antibiotic use in Belgian ambulatory care across three COVID-19 pandemic-related periods. We conducted a retrospective time series analysis using autoregressive integrated moving average modelling. The analysis is based on anonymized pharmacy dispensing data for antibiotics delivered to Belgian children aged 0-12 years, retrieved from Farmanet for the period from 2014 until 2023. The outcome measures were the number of packages, expenditures and DDDs. Outcomes were analysed for all antibiotics collectively and for subgroups based on patient characteristics, prescriber specialty, geographic region and antibiotic characteristics. Antibiotic use among children in Belgian ambulatory care sharply declined during the COVID-19 pandemic (-42.7%), followed by a gradual return to pre-pandemic levels (+66.9%), which was primarily driven by prescriptions of antibiotics commonly used for respiratory tract infections. The initial reduction exceeded expected seasonal variations. The largest decreases during the pandemic and subsequent increases were observed among children aged 7-12 years, those with standard reimbursement, in prescriptions by general practitioners and in rural areas of Flanders and the Walloon region. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted paediatric antibiotic prescribing patterns in Belgian ambulatory care. These findings highlight the importance of sustained antimicrobial stewardship efforts, not only in routine healthcare settings but also during periods of altered care delivery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40735513/,10.1093/jacamr/dlaf135 10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02724-0 10.1177/0300060518782519 10.1093/jac/dkad383 10.1177/1757913919879183 10.3109/02813432.2015.1001942 10.1186/s12913-021-06240-7 10.3390/antibiotics10050591 10.3390/antibiotics10020196 10.3390/antibiotics10121531 10.3399/BJGP.2020.1112 10.1136/bmjopen-2020-039674 10.1093/jac/dkae117 10.1093/ofid/ofab533 10.1542/peds.2021-053079 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001885 10.1186/s12874-021-01235-8 10.48804/DMZ3DN 10.1093/jac/dkae384 10.25608/v1x6-1e19 10.1016/j.eclinm.2023.101848 10.3390/antibiotics10121488 10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30917-8 10.1542/peds.2021-049972 10.1371/journal.pmed.1004512 10.1186/s12879-017-2934-3

Good biosecurity is essential to prevent, minimise or even eliminate biosecurity risks on farms. This study aimed to evaluate a pilot intervention based on an innovative, participatory approach to progressively improve biosecurity practices on small- and medium-scale pig farms in Tanzania. An observational study was conducted, where 30 farms were systematically monitored to assess the impact of using a co-created checklist on biosecurity compliance and production parameters. Livestock field officers (LFOs) were trained to provide technical guidance to farmers to implement the checklist. Focus group discussions (FGDs) were also conducted with LFOs, which were coded and thematically analysed. The median compliance score for biosecurity was significantly higher after the pilot intervention (20.0 out of 26 practices or 76.9%) compared to baseline (median of 5.50 out of 26 practices 21.2%). The time spent implementing biosecurity per sow (per day) increased from a median of 7.8-18.6 min by the end of the intervention. Pre-weaning mortality decreased from 28.6 to 25.0% and cost of antimicrobial use per sow (per month) was reduced by 57%. Meanwhile, FGDs revealed that the pilot intervention allowed LFOs to connect with farmers to provide services and collaborate with other LFOs to co-develop solutions for farmers. Despite an initial lack of trust, the relationships between LFOs and farmers were described to have positively transformed. These findings highlight the potential of using bottom-up approaches, combined with sensitisation and capacity-building, to address the unique challenges of biosecurity in low-resource settings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40735281/,10.3389/fvets.2025.1567072 10.1155/2024/4929141 10.1371/journal.pone.0158658 10.3389/fvets.2021.689811 10.3389/fvets.2024.1324233 10.4081/idr.2012.e37 10.3390/antibiotics10020106 10.1007/s13593-016-0375-9 10.1042/ETLS20200063 10.3389/fvets.2023.1070482 10.1111/tbed.13935 10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.04.010 10.1186/1748-5908-7-37 10.1186/1748-5908-6-42 10.3390/ani13162672 10.1016/j.prevetmed.2023.105840 10.1191/1478088706qp063oa 10.4073/CSR.2014.6 10.1093/jacamr/dlab193 10.3389/fvets.2022.959934 10.1017/S1867299X00002762 10.1016/j.tvjl.2013.08.029 10.1017/S1751731115002487 10.1186/s40813-016-0028-z

Recent studies suggest that acoustic startle priming (ASP) tasks may enhance speech performance and motor initiation through the corticoreticulospinal tract. This has opened up new possibilities for the application of ASP in the rehabilitation of poststroke dysarthria. The aim of this study is to investigate whether ASP can improve rehabilitation outcomes in individuals with poststroke dysarthria. This prospective, randomised, controlled clinical trial plans to enrol 48 participants diagnosed with poststroke dysarthria. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the ASP group (n=24) or the control group (n=24). Both groups will undergo 30 min of standard dysarthria rehabilitation training daily, 5 days per week for 2 weeks. The ASP group will receive an additional 30 min articulation training with ASP, while the control group will receive an equivalent 30 min articulation training with normal acoustic stimuli. Speech and voice characteristics will be assessed using Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment, PRAAT software at baseline, 1 week and 2 weeks postintervention.

Significant improvements were observed in several indicators: guideline-adherent antibiotic prescribing increased from 75% to 93.5% (p < 0.001), step-down therapy from 2.7% to 8.2% (p = 0.021), and use of CURB-65/CRB-65 from 0% to 8.7% (p < 0.001). Use of urinary antigen tests increased from 0% to 12% (p < 0.001), while evaluation of antibiotic effectiveness at 48-72 h rose from 40.2% to 70.1% (p < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression confirmed the independent impact of the intervention, adjusting for factors such as age, pneumonia severity, and shift type (day shift vs off-duty shift). A targeted, context-specific intervention significantly improved key quality indicators in CAP management. These findings support the effectiveness of multifaceted stewardship strategies in improving clinical practice and mitigating AMR.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40727100/,10.3389/fphar.2025.1627858 10.1007/s10096-025-05122-8 10.18549/pharmpract.2023.3.2844 10.3390/ijms241311038 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2009.03.012 10.1016/j.ejim.2022.01.029 10.1016/j.healthpol.2021.01.012 10.1186/s12879-021-06669-5 10.1183/09031936.00092607 10.1177/1753465810381518 10.1080/14787210.2023.2257392 10.1016/j.cmi.2020.08.037 10.1371/journal.pone.0234308 10.1186/s12879-022-07089-9 10.1016/j.lanmic.2024.07.010 10.3389/fpubh.2022.936719 10.3947/ic.2021.0093 10.1007/s40121-024-00996-1 10.7189/jogh.14.04203 10.1378/chest.122.3.913 10.1186/s13756-024-01494-2 10.1097/QCO.0000000000000819 10.1001/archinternmed.2009.259 10.1164/rccm.201908-1581ST 10.1056/NEJMclde1809210 10.1136/thoraxjnl-2019-214054 10.1007/s40121-023-00815-z 10.1093/ije/dyu029 10.1183/16000617.0123-2022 10.1038/s41598-024-63618-3 10.1016/j.jgar.2020.07.021 10.1186/s13613-021-00930-5 10.1007/s00134-023-07220-7 10.3389/bjbs.2023.11387 10.1016/S1473-3099(17)30396-1 10.1080/14760584.2023.2261785 10.1186/s12890-022-02178-6 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.53806 10.1371/journal.pone.0211157 10.7759/cureus.42672 10.1177/08850666251332116

40724010,Performance of Early Sepsis Screening Tools for Timely Diagnosis and Antibiotic Stewardship in a Resource-Limited Thai Community Hospital.,"Wanlumkhao W, Rattanamongkolgul D, Ekpanyaskul C",2025,"Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)","Early identification of sepsis is critical for improving outcomes, particularly in low-resource emergency settings. In Thai community hospitals, where physicians may not always be available, triage is often nurse-led. Selecting accurate and practical sepsis screening tools is essential not only for timely clinical decision-making but also for timely diagnosis and promoting appropriate antibiotic use. This cross-sectional study analyzed 475 adult patients with suspected sepsis who presented to the emergency department of a Thai community hospital, using retrospective data from January 2021 to December 2022. Six screening tools were evaluated: Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), National Early Warning Score (NEWS), National Early Warning Score version 2 (NEWS2), and Search Out Severity (SOS). Diagnostic accuracy was assessed using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes as the reference standard. Performance metrics included sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, likelihood ratios, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, all reported with 95% confidence intervals. SIRS had the highest sensitivity (84%), while qSOFA demonstrated the highest specificity (91%). NEWS2, NEWS, and MEWS showed moderate and balanced diagnostic accuracy. SOS also demonstrated moderate accuracy. A two-step screening approach-using SIRS for initial triage followed by NEWS2 for confirmation-is recommended. This strategy enhances nurse-led screening and optimizes limited resources in emergency care.
