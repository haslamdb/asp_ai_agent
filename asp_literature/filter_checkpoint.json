      "abstract": "The emergency department (ED) is increasingly recognized as a critical site for antimicrobial stewardship, where most initial antibiotic decisions occur, and emergency physicians (EPs), previously regarded as primarily focused on empiric treatment, are now emerging as leaders. Policy milestones, including accreditation standards and national guidelines, have catalyzed this transition, yet physician roles remain heterogeneous, and evidence on long-term outcomes is limited. Drawing on English-language literature, including intervention studies, descriptive reports, and policy documents, this editorial highlights how EPs contribute through guideline development, audit and feedback, culture follow-up, formulary oversight, rapid diagnostics, and educational initiatives. Evidence consistently shows improvements in prescribing appropriateness, reduced use of broad-spectrum agents, and faster optimization without compromising safety. However, barriers such as time pressure, professional culture, role ambiguity, and limited resources remain persistent. Importantly, the leadership of EPs has proven central in overcoming these obstacles, especially when supported by institutional commitment and integrated workflows. Their engagement is not only improving immediate prescribing practices but also represents a critical frontline defense against antimicrobial resistance and multidrug-resistant organisms. Looking forward, formalizing physician leadership, embedding stewardship in emergency medicine training, and building ED-specific data systems are essential to sustain safe and effective antibiotic use.",

      "abstract": "Medication Use Evaluations (MUEs) are structured quality improvement tools used to optimize medication use within healthcare systems. MUEs can explore safety concerns, high costs, or inappropriate use associated with any medication, among other factors. This can offer a valuable opportunity for Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASPs) to promote stewardship goals, which often overlap with these concerns for specific antimicrobials. MUEs can also provide an avenue to promote interdisciplinary collaboration with targeted groups relevant to the ASP's goals as well as an opportunity to give trainees ownership of system-facing stewardship projects. Stewardship pharmacists may often have experience with leading this process as part of their training, but MUEs represent a gap in training for physicians. Here we provide guidance on how stewardship physicians can engage in the MUE process, from identifying relevant topics to interpreting findings and supporting implementation efforts, allowing them to contribute effectively even without prior MUE experience.",

      "abstract": "Excessive use of postoperative prophylactic antibiotics in children's hospitals is a significant public health concern, leading to increased risks of infections like Clostridioides difficile, multidrug-resistant organisms, and unnecessary healthcare costs. Antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs) are designed to optimize antibiotic use, but ideal strategies for implementing evidence-based guidelines remain unclear. We tested facilitation, a dynamic process where trained individuals support healthcare personnel in bridging evidence-practice gaps, as a promising strategy for the de-implementation of unnecessary postoperative antibiotics in healthcare.\nThe OPerAtiC trial employed a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled design across nine hospitals to compare the effectiveness of two ASP-led strategies, specifically order set changes to align with antibiotic guidelines (baseline arm) and facilitation training (intervention arm). Facilitation workshops were informed by the i-PARIHS framework, emphasizing context analysis, evidence application, and recipient engagement; and were conducted remotely. Data were collected from 2019 to 2024, involving interviews with stewardship team members every two months. Data collected included proximal implementation outcomes of each ASP team member (acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness), intermediate outcomes (facilitation skill use) reported by the ASP team, and order set change completion rates.\nProximal implementation outcomes for both strategies were rated high across all study phases, indicating strong baseline enthusiasm among participants (N\u2009=\u200930). Key facilitation skills-effective communication, conflict resolution, and data presentation-were pivotal for successful implementation. Most order set changes (76%) were completed post-facilitation, targeting various specialties and achieving reductions or eliminations in antibiotic use. Facilitation was associated with significantly more completed order sets targeting antibiotic reduction (p\u2009=\u20090.01), suggesting a potential pathway to improve the appropriateness of antibiotic use through implementation strategies.\nFacilitation is a valuable approach in refining ASP efforts, contributing to the successful reduction and de-implementation of unnecessary antibiotic use in children's hospitals. The study underscores the need for ongoing training and support for ASP teams to enhance their effectiveness in promoting appropriate antibiotic-prescribing practices. Future research should explore the long-term impacts of facilitation on antibiotic stewardship and patient outcomes.\nClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT04366440, https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04366440?term=OPERATIC&rank=1&tab=history , registered on 04/27/2020.",

      "authors": "Lynch C",
      "year": 2025,
      "journal": "Cureus",
      "abstract": "Introduction Antibiotic stewardship is becoming critically important as resistant bacteria become increasingly prevalent. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as a major global health challenge, driven in part by the misuse and overuse of antibiotics. An acute sore throat is one of the most frequent reasons for patients to seek medical care, yet only a minority of cases require antibiotic treatment. Despite this, inappropriate prescribing is rife, often influenced by diagnostic uncertainty, patient expectations, and non-clinical pressures. These challenges highlight the importance of reinforcing evidence-based strategies, such as the use of Centor criteria, to support accurate assessment and reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing in patients presenting with a sore throat. This quality improvement project evaluated adherence to Centor criteria and subsequent antibiotic prescribing in an accident and emergency (A&E) department in the Northwest of England, before and after clinician education on NICE guidance and documentation of Centor criteria. Materials and methods One hundred patients presenting with an acute sore throat between January and March 2023 were identified. Electronic patient data were collected retrospectively to analyze the documentation's adherence to NICE guidelines and Modified Centor criteria. Results Pre-intervention, 16% of clinicians documented all Centor criteria, 48% incorrectly prescribed antibiotics, and only 20% prescribed appropriate antibiotics. Through post-intervention teaching and literature dissemination, the figures changed to 54%, 22%, and 56%, respectively. Conclusion Targeted clinician education and adherence to NICE guidelines improved antibiotic prescribing for the acute sore throat, underscoring the value of audit cycles while highlighting the need for sustained, larger-scale efforts to reduce AMR.",

It is estimated that, in certain situations, up to 80% of antibiotic prescriptions in dentistry may be inappropriate. The aim of this study was to explore Spanish dentists' attitudes, perceptions, and contextual factors influencing antibiotic use and misuse in clinical practice.\nFrom July to December 2022, we conducted focus groups with 31 dentists from Spain Data were analysed using thematic analysis with a pragmatic orientation to address the research objectives. Inclusion criteria required participants to be dentistry graduates or oral medicine specialists (stomatologists) and actively working as dentists. The sample was selected through key informants and the snowball method. We ensured methodological quality by adhering to the COREQ checklist.\nWe formed seven synchronous online focus groups with 31 participants. Dentists acknowledged the problem of antibiotic resistance, identifying fear, working conditions and burnout and patient trust as factors contributing to inappropriate prescribing. Despite this awareness, dentists did not see themselves as key agents of change in combating antibiotic resistance. However, they expressed interest in further education on the topic.\nThese findings underscore the need for educational interventions that highlight dentists' role in antimicrobial stewardship. By situating these interventions within the One Health framework, dentists can be empowered to translate their leadership in oral health into active participation in the prudent use of antibiotics.

      "abstract": "Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) education plays a vital role in addressing antimicrobial resistance (AMR), yet its long-term impact on behavior and clinical outcomes remains underexplored. Educational interventions are often assessed through knowledge-based outcomes, with limited evaluation of sustained practice changes or patient-level results, and standardized higher-level outcome measures across diverse healthcare settings.\nThis scoping review aimed to map pre-post AMS healthcare educational interventions using the Kirkpatrick Model, evaluating their effectiveness across its four levels: reaction, learning, behavior, and results. The goal was to identify trends, highlight gaps, and provide insight into reported outcomes, delivery methods, and evaluation tools, supporting future research and strengthening the evidence base for AMS education.\nThis review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute framework. A literature search of nine databases identified studies from 2010 to 2024. Eligible studies included pre-post AMS educational interventions targeting undergraduate students and healthcare professionals (HCPs) and reporting outcomes which were subsequently mapped by the reviewers to the Kirkpatrick Model. Data were categorized by target population, delivery format, and evaluation tools. Narrative synthesis was used to describe trends and relationships.\nStudies targeted HCPs such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and dental professionals, and undergraduate students in pharmacy, medicine, nursing, and dentistry. Sixty-three studies were included. Outcomes were distributed across Level 1 (Reaction) (n\u2009=\u200946, 24%), Level 2 (Learning) (n\u2009=\u200951, 27%), Level 3 (Behavior) (n\u2009=\u200950, 26%), and Level 4 (Results) (n\u2009=\u200945, 23%). While n\u2009=\u200924 (38%) assessed all four levels, another n\u2009=\u200924 (38%) reported mixed or partial levels. Face-to-face or online-only formats achieved Levels 1 and 2. Whereas blended or workplace-integrated interventions more often demonstrated behavior change and clinical outcomes (Levels 3 and 4). Longitudinal follow-up and mixed evaluation tools (e.g., surveys, chart reviews, interviews) supported higher-level impacts. Pharmacy-led, interdisciplinary, and contextually tailored interventions mapped to all levels.\nAMS education often leads to short-term learning gains, but fewer interventions achieve sustained behavior change or measurable clinical outcomes. Blended and practice-integrated formats, paired with long-term evaluation, are key to realizing the full potential of AMS education. Embedding such approaches in undergraduate and professional programs can better prepare the future HCPs to address AMR effectively.",

Also, to assess whether these curricula meet WHO recommendations and identify any gaps compared with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) antimicrobial prescribing and stewardship competency framework.\nA search for online education resources was carried out to identify UG curricula or CFs for HCPs for AMS or antimicrobial resistance applicable to the UK.\nSeven curricula or CFs were identified and reviewed. One AMS CF for all UG health workers, three for pharmacy UG students, one nursing AMS CF, one medical AMS CF, and the pathology curriculum. Domains varied between them but significant overlap was identified, and the majority of knowledge objectives in the WHO modules were covered in all UG curricula/CFs (except those objectives listed under the role of laboratory staff, which were only in the pathology curriculum). Gaps were identified between the most recently published UG curricula for pharmacists and the UKHSA antimicrobial prescribing and stewardship CF.\nThere is significant correlation between the UG curricula/CFs for HCPs in the UK, the WHO curricula guide, and UKHSA antimicrobial prescribing and stewardship CF; however, there are some identified gaps. Despite the availability of UG curricula and/or CFs for the majority of HCPs, these are not consistently embedded in UG training.",

This study evaluated the effectiveness of this 2-year training programme, measuring knowledge, skills and tangible results.\nThis observational cohort study included participants in the first AMS certificate programme, which started in June 2022. The programme included online and live courses covering relevant AMS learning goals. Participants also carried out a local AMS project using a determinant analysis with pre- and post-intervention measurements. Data were collected through surveys, exams, and an evaluation of mandatory reports to assess progress across Kirkpatrick's four levels of learning: reaction, learning, behaviour and results.\nForty participants from 22 countries took part in the programme. Individual courses were positively evaluated (reaction, level 1). All participants passed the final exam (learning, level 2). After 2 years, 35/40 (88%) submitted their AMS project reports (behaviour, level 3). In 31/35 (89%) of projects a post-intervention measurement was performed, of which 26/31 (84%) showed a positive effect on either process outcomes (e.g. increase in guideline adherence), quantity outcomes (e.g. reduced broad-spectrum antibiotic use), or patient outcomes (e.g. length of stay) (results, level 4).\nThe ESCMID AMS certificate programme effectively transfers knowledge and skills to participants who intend to develop ASPs in different clinical settings. Moreover, the course prompted the development and execution of local AMS projects with measurable impact on appropriate antibiotic use practices.",

Primary outcomes included time from clinical diagnosis to pathogen-directed therapy and targeted therapy within 48\u2005h. Secondary outcomes assessed antimicrobial appropriateness (DOOR-MAT), length of stay, and mortality.\nThe rDTSI program significantly reduced the median time to pathogen-directed therapy in pneumonia (48.8 vs 23.6\u2005h, \nThe rDTSI program accelerated microbiological diagnosis, optimized antimicrobial therapy, and improved hospital efficiency in severe infections. These findings support integrating rapid diagnostics into antimicrobial stewardship programs to enhance severe infection management.",

      "abstract": "Most antibiotics are prescribed, dispensed, and consumed in the community setting. Community pharmacists have a great potential to optimise antibiotic use and mitigate antibiotic resistance in this setting through antibiotic stewardship. This commentary aims to highlight critical areas where community pharmacists can contribute to optimising antibiotic use and to offer suggestions for how this can be implemented in practice. Currently, the role of the community pharmacist is mostly limited to dispensing of antibiotics and treatment of minor infectious ailments. This role needs to evolve to optimise antibiotic use and mitigate resistance development. Following the Social Care Framework for applying person-centred healthcare, there are five strategies through which the role of the community pharmacist can evolve: awareness, adjustment, assistance, alignment, and advocacy. Concretely, this could include many different activities such as better informing and counselling patients, optimising antibiotic treatment duration and choice, exact quantity dispensing, performing point-of-care tests, pharmacist prescribing of antibiotics, and joining academic detailing and public health campaigns. To achieve this, education, policy, and research need to be further aligned. In many countries, pharmacy education on antimicrobial stewardship needs a stronger basis in universities, followed by early career specialisation and continuous professional development. National and international policy changes are needed to recognise such specialisations and allow more advanced pharmacy services. Pharmacy research must be expanded and tailored to the community setting with innovative and practice-based designs. This will allow community pharmacists to fully embrace an enhanced position in antibiotic use and primary care.",

We used national guidelines to determine criteria for nonsevere AOM and first-line antibiotics for AOM and pharyngitis. Participating UCCs committed at least 3 clinicians to submit 10 encounters for each diagnosis per month during the intervention period (October 2022 to June 2023). Clinicians signed commitment letters, participated in monthly learning sessions, and tested UCC-selected interventions.\nWe recruited 84 participants from 13 UCCs. Participants submitted 5017 AOM encounters and 3762 pharyngitis encounters. The use of first-line antibiotics for AOM and GAS pharyngitis remained stable at 75.7% and 79.9%, respectively, throughout the project. The documentation of delayed antibiotic criteria increased from a range of 26%-27% at baseline to 83% [5.42% per month (95% CI: 4.03-6.81)]. This corresponded to an increase in use of delayed antibiotics for AOM from a range of 32%-42% at baseline to 70% by the end of the intervention period [2.53% per month (95% CI: 0.57-4.48)]. Rates of GAS testing before treating pharyngitis increased during baseline and remained high (>96%) throughout the intervention period.\nThis multicenter collaborative provided education and networking to increase the use of delayed antibiotics for AOM in pediatric UCCs.",

This type of educational outreach approach using TARGET (Target Antibiotics Responsibly, Guidance, Education and Tools) antibiotic materials has previously been shown to reduce antibiotic dispensing in a UK primary care setting. The workshop included a review of antibiotic prescribing data, a presentation on paediatric AMS showcasing locally agreed paediatric prescribing guidelines and safety-netting resources from the Healthier Together website, and formulation of a local action plan. The primary outcome measure was total oral antibiotic prescriptions ('items') dispensed per 1000 patients aged under 5\u2005years for the year after the workshop, compared with the previous year's dispensing.\nThe median prescribing rate for children under 5\u2005years of age changed from a baseline of 48.9 per 1000 patients prior to the intervention to a new median monthly prescribing rate of 39.0 per 1000 patients following the intervention. There was no increase in paediatric presentations to primary care following the intervention.\nThis low-cost intervention has the potential to reduce primary care antibiotic prescribing in children and we did not detect an increase in GP attendance rates after this intervention in our study.

      "abstract": "Recent advances in microbiome research have highlighted the oral cavity as a complex and dynamic ecosystem, home to over 700 microbial species that play critical roles in both oral and systemic health. The oral microbiota not only maintains local tissue homeostasis but also serves as a reservoir for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, contributing to the global spread of resistance. Frequent and sometimes inappropriate antibiotic use in dental practice, along with exposure to antiseptics and biocides, drives the emergence and horizontal transfer of resistance determinants within oral biofilms. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms and ecological drivers of AMR in the oral microbiome, emphasizing the clinical implications of dysbiosis and drug-resistant infections. The authors advocate for the development of dental clinical guidelines tailored to the unique characteristics of the oral microbiota, focusing on personalized therapy through molecular diagnostics, standardized AMR risk assessment, and the integration of non-antibiotic strategies such as probiotics and photodynamic therapy. Continuous education in antimicrobial stewardship and the implementation of oral-specific AMR surveillance is also highlighted as an essential component of effective resistance management. To support rational prescribing, a dedicated mobile application has been developed, leveraging microbiota data and resistance profiles to guide evidence-based, targeted therapy and reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. Collectively, these strategies aim to preserve antibiotic efficacy, ensure patient safety, and promote sustainable infection management in the dental field.",

      "abstract": "Strengthening antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programs is an invaluable intervention in the ongoing efforts to contain the threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), particularly in low-resource settings. This study evaluates the impact of the Telementoring, Education, and Advocacy Collaboration initiative for Health through Antimicrobial Stewardship (TEACH AMS), which uses the virtual Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) learning model to enhance AMS capacity in Kenya, Ghana, and Malawi.\nA mixed-methods approach was used, which included attendance data collection, facility-level assessments, post-session and follow-up surveys, as well as focus group discussions.\nBetween September 2023 and February 2025, 77 virtual learning sessions were conducted, engaging 2445 unique participants from hospital-based AMS committees and health professionals across the three countries. Participants reported significant knowledge gain, and data showed facility improvements in two core AMS areas, including the implementation of multidisciplinary ward-based interventions/communications and enhanced monitoring of antibiotic resistance patterns. Along those lines, participants reported that the program assisted them in improving prescribing and culture-based treatments, and also evidence-informed antibiotic selection. The evidence of implementing ward-based interventions was further stressed in focus group discussions, as well as other strengthened practices like point-prevalence surveys, and development or revision of stewardship policies. Substantial improvements in microbiology services were also shared by participants, particularly in Malawi. Other practices mentioned were strengthened multidisciplinary communication, infection prevention efforts, and education of patients and the community.\nOur findings suggest that a virtual case-based learning educational intervention, providing structured and tailored AMS capacity building, can drive behavior change and strengthen healthcare systems in low resource settings. Future efforts should aim to scale up the engagements and sustain improvements to further strengthen AMS capacity.",

Locally, 50-60% of patients had extended prophylaxis after pacemaker insertion or generator change. Our antimicrobial stewardship programme (ASP) incorporated behavioural change strategies in implementing a multi-pronged intervention bundle to address this and evaluated its effectiveness and safety.\nThis single-centre, retrospective cohort study included patients aged 21 years old or older, undergoing uncomplicated pacemaker insertion or generator change at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) from October 2022 to March 2025. To improve antibiotic use, ASP interventions incorporating behaviour change strategies were implemented, namely (1) data-driven feedback, (2) targeted education, (3) identification and engagement of ASP champion, and (4) clinical pathway revision.\nThere were 779 patients evaluated; 380 (48.8%) received standard prophylaxis while 399 (51.2%) received extended prophylaxis with oral antibiotics (mean duration, 3.3 \u00b1 0.8 days). Following ASP interventions, the practice of extended prophylaxis declined significantly from 43.8% to 24.0% (\nThe bundled ASP interventions, incorporating behavioural change strategies, have effectively and safely reduced the use of extended prophylaxis post-cardiac device implantation.

Evaluation of the quantity and appropriateness of common antifungal prescriptions like fluconazole is essential in the development of these programmes. To perform a clinical audit of fluconazole prescribing and explore whether involvement of pharmacy students in this process was feasible and meaningful from both pharmacy student and health system perspectives. An audit was conducted of all fluconazole prescriptions from January 2024 to March 2024 at two Sydney hospitals. Trained pharmacy students, under the supervision of antimicrobial stewardship pharmacists and physicians, completed the audit using the Antifungal National Antimicrobial Prescribing Survey audit tool. Prescriptions were assessed for their compliance to guidelines and appropriateness. Data on pharmacy students' educational experience was collected by a 5-point Likert scale survey. A total of 145 fluconazole prescriptions were audited: 34 for empiric therapy, 56 for directed therapy, and 56 for prophylaxis. A total of 91 (62.8%) prescriptions were assessed as appropriate, 46 (31.7%) were inappropriate, and 8 (5.5%) were not assessable. Potential drug-drug interactions were identified in 17 patients receiving fluconazole doses of 200\u00a0mg or greater, of which three were clinically significant, requiring intervention. Students had positive experiences contributing to quality use of medicines, in terms of enjoyment, support, and education. Inappropriate fluconazole use was common. Pharmacy students made a positive contribution to the antifungal audit, promoting good stewardship practises for the hospital while accessing enhanced learning and development opportunities.\nA multisite clinical audit of 145 fluconazole prescriptions found 62.8% were appropriate, 31.7% inappropriate. Pharmacy students played a vital role in the audit by identifying drug interactions and gaining valuable learning experiences. Their involvement supported antifungal stewardship efforts.",

Enhancing professionals' communication skills is one of the most promising interventions for optimising antibiotic prescription in respiratory tract infections in children.\nWe developed a communication skills course for primary care paediatricians, paediatric nurses and community pharmacists. We conducted: 1) A scoping review, 2) brainstorming and selection of themes, 3) design of content, 4) user testing, through a survey and semi-structured interviews. A multidisciplinary advisory group gave feedback throughout the design and development process. We conducted a descriptive analysis of the survey results, and we used a predefined analytical framework for qualitative content.\nThe course comprised four modules with nineteen themes, which included communication theoretical content, clinical cases, complementary reading, videos, and a glossary. It also included a forum and webinars, after each module. Sixteen users completed several themes and a survey, and eight were interviewed. They rated a mean of 4 or higher (5-point scale), across most of the domains evaluated. The videos received the highest rating (4.81; SD\u2009=\u20090.39). Suggestions for improvement included incorporating a workshop, and featuring more representation of other professionals. The majority of professionals (93%) expressed interest in completing the course.\nWe developed a comprehensive, evidence-based online communication skills training course to optimise antibiotic prescribing in paediatric primary care. Integrating key communication strategies and insights from a scoping review, the course equips healthcare professionals with practical tools to enhance shared decision-making and antimicrobial stewardship.\nNot applicable.",

      "abstract": "To highlight the unintended consequences of microbiological test results in driving inappropriate antimicrobial prescriptions, and to evaluate strategies - particularly from the perspective of diagnostic stewardship - that may mitigate this issue.\nDespite the critical role of microbiological data in guiding appropriate antimicrobial therapy, several studies have demonstrated that misinterpretation of such results frequently leads to unnecessary treatments. Common pitfalls include overinterpretation of positive cultures from poorly collected or clinically unwarranted samples, misclassification of colonization vs. infection, and excessive reliance on test results in the absence of supporting clinical evidence. Emerging diagnostic stewardship interventions - ranging from restricting sample processing and modifying test reporting to implementing decision support tools - have shown promising outcomes in reducing overtreatment without compromising patient safety. Specific examples include urine and wound cultures, respiratory specimens, and the diagnosis of Clostridioides difficile infection. Furthermore, educational and system-level strategies such as the BLADDER score or selective result reporting can improve decision-making at various stages of the diagnostic process.\nMicrobiology laboratories play a pivotal role in antimicrobial stewardship and must actively support clinicians in avoiding diagnostic and therapeutic errors. While evidence supports multiple approaches to mitigate inappropriate prescriptions driven by microbiology results, their successful implementation requires interdisciplinary collaboration, tailored interventions, and ongoing evaluation of clinical impact. Diagnostic stewardship, when aligned with clinician education and robust reporting practices, is a crucial component in enhancing the accuracy of infection diagnosis and reducing antimicrobial overuse.",

This growing threat demands urgent and coordinated action from health systems across the globe. A key driver of antimicrobial resistance is the inappropriate and excessive use of antibiotics, which accelerates the development of resistant strains. At the same time, the lack of new antibiotics in development exacerbates the crisis. In this context, promoting the appropriate and prudent use of antibiotics is essential to limit the emergence and spread of resistance.\nA randomized, multicentre, parallel-group clinical trial with a hybrid type I (effectiveness-implementation) design to reduce antibiotic prescriptions in primary care. General practitioners from three regional health systems in Spain will be randomly assigned (1:1) to an intervention or active control group. The intervention includes a monthly Audit & Feedback report, pharmacist-led consultations, clinical messages, patient information sheets, and an online training module.

      "abstract": "Antimicrobial Stewardship programs (ASPs) help reduce antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by promoting responsible antibiotic use. However, implementation is often inconsistent, especially in low-resource settings. Digital health technologies (DHTs) provide scalable and flexible means to enhance ASPs, particularly through targeted educational interventions for clinicians, students, and the public.\nThis systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of digital educational within ASPs by enhancing knowledge and driving behavior change, with a specific focus on the educational strategies employed, their theoretical underpinnings, and their differential impact across populations and settings.\nThis review followed PRISMA and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines, with a protocol registered in PROSPERO. A comprehensive search of four databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL) was conducted to identify primary peer-reviewed studies published in English that quantitatively evaluated digital educational ASPs. Risk of bias was assessed using standardized appraisal tools.\nTwenty-three studies, conducted in diverse contexts and targeting different stakeholders, were included in the review. All interventions reported positive impacts on knowledge enhancement and behavior change. Engagement-driven approaches, such as interactive modules, real-time feedback, and case-based simulations, were most common, and strategies were tailored to the specific target groups. However, theoretical underpinnings were rarely reported, with only two studies explicitly grounded in behavior change theory. Few studies included long-term follow-up assessments, and most lacked rigorous designs such as randomization. Risk of bias was assessed and varied across studies. The interventions varied widely in duration, frequency, and delivery format, limiting comparability.\nDigital educational ASPs show strong promise in improving knowledge and driving behavior change across a wide range of settings and stakeholder groups. Their adaptability, scalability, and user-centered design underscore their potential as valuable tools in the global effort to combat antimicrobial resistance. To maximize their long-term impact, future interventions should be informed by behavioral theory, include follow-up beyond six months, and address contextual needs in low-resource settings.",

      "abstract": "Inaccurate penicillin allergy labels (PALs) affect antimicrobial stewardship, health outcomes, and costs. More than 95% of PALs can be de-labeled when tested, but this rarely happens.\nWe sought to determine whether education and an electronic health record (EHR) tool kit to identify low-risk PALs would facilitate inpatient penicillin allergy de-labeling by pharmacists.\nPragmatic Removal of Penicillin Allergy Electronic Health Record Labels was a stepped-wedge, nonblinded, randomized, controlled, pragmatic clinical trial including 12 inpatient medical units. From November 2020 to November 2021, units entered intervention at 1-month stepped intervals in random order. Medically stable, nonpregnant adults with an her-documented PAL who were hospitalized on intervention units for 24 hours were included. The intervention included pharmacist and nursing education, a patient list for systematic identification of PALs, presentation of a risk-assessment tool, and an oral amoxicillin challenge order set. The primary outcome was removal of PAL by hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included safety and implementation measures, longer-term continued label removal, and antibiotic use.\nOn 12 randomized units, 2,052 patients with a PAL presented during the 1-year trial. More intervention-exposed patients had EHR-documented penicillin allergy removal compared with controls (45 of 1,018 [4.4%] vs 31 of 1,034 [3%], respectively; adjusted odds ratio = 2.05; 95% CI, 1.08-3.91). More intervention-exposed patients received an EHR-documented penicillin allergy risk assessment than did controls (86 of 1,018 [8.4%] vs 27 of 1,034 [2.6%]; adjusted odds ratio = 6.42; 95% CI, 3.08-13.38). Moreover, 27 of 1,018 intervention patients (2.7%) received amoxicillin challenge compared with 21 of 1,034 control patients (2.0%). All amoxicillin challenges were tolerated.\nEducation and deployment of an inpatient EHR tool kit increased the rate of inpatient removal of inaccurate penicillin allergies before discharge.",

      "abstract": "The global emergence of multiresistant pathogens threatens the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapies and calls for a\u00a0rational use of antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals. The main reason for the development of resistance is the inappropriate use of these substances in human and veterinary medicine and agriculture. Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) combines strategies for optimizing prescribing practices in order to prevent the development of resistance, ensure successful treatment, and minimize side effects. Central elements are evidence-based guidelines, interdisciplinary visits, infectious disease consults, targeted training, feedback systems, and digital support. AMS is becoming increasingly established in Germany, but many antibiotics are still not prescribed in line with guidelines. Correct diagnosis, guideline-based empirical therapy, regular re-evaluation, dose adjustment, early oral administration, and outpatient parenteral anti-infective therapy (OPAT) are essential. Short, individually adapted treatment durations improve tolerability and reduce resistance pressure. AMS links epidemiological data with patient-specific factors and is key in personalized infection medicine. Only the consistent integration of AMS measures into everyday clinical practice can ensure the sustained efficacy of antimicrobial substances and improve the quality of patient care in the long term.\nDas weltweite Auftreten multiresistenter Erreger bedroht die Wirksamkeit antimikrobieller Therapien und fordert ein Umdenken im Umgang mit Antibiotika, Virostatika und Antimykotika. Hauptursache f\u00fcr die Resistenzentwicklung ist der h\u00e4ufig unsachgem\u00e4\u00dfe Einsatz dieser Substanzen in Human- und Veterin\u00e4rmedizin sowie in der Landwirtschaft. Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) b\u00fcndelt Strategien zur Optimierung der Verschreibungspraxis, um Resistenzentwicklung zu verhindern, Therapieerfolge zu sichern und Nebenwirkungen zu minimieren. Zentrale Elemente sind die Etablierung evidenzbasierter Leitlinien, interdisziplin\u00e4rer Visiten, eines infektiologischen Konsilwesens, gezielter Schulungen und von Feedbacksystemen. In Deutschland etabliert sich AMS zunehmend, dennoch werden viele Antiinfektiva weiterhin nicht leitliniengerecht verordnet. Die korrekte Infektionsdiagnosestellung, leitlinienbasierte empirische Therapie, regelm\u00e4\u00dfige Reevaluation, Dosisanpassung, fr\u00fchzeitige Oralisierung sowie die ambulante parenterale Antiinfektivatherapie (APAT) sind essenzielle AMS-Werkzeuge. Kurze, individuell angepasste Therapiedauern verbessern die Vertr\u00e4glichkeit und reduzieren Resistenzdruck. AMS verkn\u00fcpft epidemiologische Daten mit patientenindividuellen Faktoren und ist ein Schl\u00fcssel zu personalisierter Infektionsmedizin. Durch die konsequente Integration von AMS-Ma\u00dfnahmen in den klinischen Alltag kann die nachhaltige Wirksamkeit antimikrobieller Substanzen gesichert und die Qualit\u00e4t der Patientenversorgung langfristig verbessert werden.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate antibiotic prescription knowledge and practices among Oman Medical Specialty Board (OMSB) paediatric residents. The goal was to identify educational opportunities to reduce antimicrobial resistance and improve patient care.\nA survey-based cross-sectional study was conducted among the OMSB paediatric residents from August 2023 to September 2023. The online survey involved three parts: residents' demographics, knowledge of 12 common paediatric infection scenarios and clinical practice. Participants were asked to choose the proper antibiotic choices and duration for each scenario. Data analysis was performed using SPSS.\nA total of 74 responses were obtained, resulting in an 84% response rate. No significant differences were observed in the knowledge of antibiotic prescriptions among paediatric residents at different stages of their residency. The highest knowledge-based adherence rate to local antibiotic guidelines was noted in the acute sinusitis scenario (n = 70; 94.6%), followed by the acute meningitis scenario (n = 68; 91.9%). Conversely, the lowest adherence was observed in the acute otitis media (n = 16; 21.6%), followed by cellulitis (n = 23; 31.1%). Residents exhibited proficient clinical judgement by consulting infectious disease specialists when required based on the scenarios provided.\nThe low knowledge-based adherence to antibiotic guidelines for common paediatric infections, coupled with the lack of significant differences in antibiotic knowledge between senior and junior paediatric residents, underscores the need for collective educational interventions. These interventions aim to advance knowledge and skills in antimicrobial stewardship and local antibiotic guidelines application.",

      "abstract": "Antimicrobial stewardship is a collaborative intervention strategy aimed at promoting the selection of optimal antimicrobial regimens to improve and measure the appropriate use of antimicrobials, thereby fostering rational use of these agents, enhancing patient outcomes effectively, and curbing the wide dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. Recently, nurses' pivotal contribution in multidisciplinary antimicrobial stewardship teams is increasingly recognized. However, the contexts and mechanisms able to facilitate nurses' participation in the complex dynamics of antimicrobial stewardship remain unclear.\nThis review aims to identify and analyze the mechanisms, contextual factors, and outcomes that promote nurses' participation in antimicrobial stewardship interventions.\nThis study adheres to the methods of realist review based on the Normalization Process Theory. Preliminary programme theories were generated through an extensive literature review and thematic analysis. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, CNKI, and Wangfang databases. The final Context-Mechanism-Outcome configurations were determined to validate the final programme theory.\nA total of 5635 articles were retrieved; ultimately, 35 studies were included for a comprehensive analysis. The review identified five key configurations clarifying the interactions among contextual factors, mechanisms, and outcomes: (1) Contextual factors: multidisciplinary team collaboration and hospital organizational support. (2) Strategies and mechanisms: articulating nurses' contributions and impact (Coherence-Building), promoting awareness and positive perceptions (Cognitive Participation), enhancing nurses' competencies (Collective Action), fostering collaborative and motivating frameworks, and emphasizing continuous quality improvement (Reflexive Monitoring). (3) Outcomes: improvements in patient outcomes (e.g., faster antibiotic initiation, shorter hospital stays, and lower mortality) and staff outcomes (e.g., enhanced knowledge, confidence, and adherence to antimicrobial stewardship practices).\nThis realist review has developed a theoretical framework to promote nurses' participation in antimicrobial stewardship practices. This framework emphasizes the complex dynamic mechanisms that facilitate or hinder nurses' involvement in antimicrobial stewardship and aims to implement evidence-based strategies to encourage nurses' participation in antimicrobial stewardship practices. This, in turn, is expected to enhance the effectiveness of hospital antimicrobial stewardship initiatives and improve the quality of patient care within the hospital environment.\nThis realist review highlights that, at both individual and organizational levels, supporting nurses' professional roles and responsibilities through targeted education, expanded prescribing authority, collaborative frameworks, and continuous quality improvement empowers nurses to integrate antimicrobial stewardship into their daily practice. By delineating the relevant mechanisms, contextual factors, and outcomes, the findings inform the design of complex interventions to sustain nurses' engagement in hospital antimicrobial stewardship programs, and advance the evolution of advanced nursing practice.",

      "abstract": "Antibiotic overuse has been well-documented in all populations, including pediatrics. Pediatric pharmacists are valuable and well-integrated within inpatient antibiotic stewardship programs (ASP) in children's hospitals. The Pediatric Pharmacy Association (PPA) believes all pharmacists, regardless of practice setting, should receive education to support entry-level stewardship activities in pediatric patients. Additionally, pediatric antibiotic stewardship pharmacist leaders should ideally be trained in both infectious diseases (ID) and pediatrics. Currently, specialized training in pediatric ID lacks standardization due to the paucity of subspecialized training opportunities. This paper provides recommendations to support pediatric ASP training, education, and pharmacist staffing for inpatient programs. Further, it is recommended to ensure protected time is available for daily and longitudinal pediatric ASP activities to support optimal care and prevent burnout. Finally, the PPA supports the evolving role of the pediatric pharmacist in the ambulatory ASP arena and recommends investigations into unique payment modalities.",

      "abstract": "Delay in the initial administration of antimicrobials is one of the strongest predictors for mortality for septic patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Given the different logistics among hospitals for antibiotic administration, this delay can take hours. As antibiotic administration involves care coordination and the participation of different team members, education and the antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) program play a key role in reducing these times. This study evaluated the time between the initial prescription and the effective administration of antibiotics for ICU patients in seven Latin American hospitals, before (pre-) and after (post-I and post-II) the implementation of a tailored educational approach. After establishing a baseline measurement (pre-), we implemented a tailored educational intervention directed to the ICU team including nurses, specialists, pharmacists, and the members of the AMS team. Then, we conducted a post-intervention measurement after a 3 month period (post-I) and repeated it after a 1 year period (post-II). During the pre-interventional phase, the hang time varied between 88 and 178 min, reporting an adherence to the 1 hour bundle of 33.8%. For the post-I, it significantly reduced with time variations between 46 and 104 min, showing an increase of 54.9% in adherence. After 1 year, in post-II, a persistent effect of shorter administration time was observed, varying between 49 and 109 min, increasing the adherence to 59.6%.

      "abstract": "Excessive use of postoperative prophylactic antibiotics in children's hospitals is a significant public health concern, leading to increased risks of infections like \nThe OPerAtiC trial employed a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled design across nine hospitals to compare the effectiveness of two ASP-led strategies, specifically order set changes to align with antibiotic guidelines (baseline arm) and facilitation training (intervention arm). Facilitation workshops were informed by the i-PARIHS framework, emphasizing context analysis, evidence application, and recipient engagement; and were conducted remotely. Data were collected from 2019 to 2024, involving interviews with stewardship team members every two months. Data collected included proximal implementation outcomes of each ASP team member (acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness), intermediate outcomes (facilitation skill use) reported by the ASP team, and order set change completion rates.\nProximal implementation outcomes for both strategies were rated high across all study phases, indicating strong baseline enthusiasm among participants (N = 30). Key facilitation skills-effective communication, conflict resolution, and data presentation-were pivotal for successful implementation. Most order set changes (76%) were completed post-facilitation, targeting various specialties and achieving reductions or eliminations in antibiotic use. Facilitation was associated with significantly more completed order sets targeting antibiotic reduction (p = 0.01), thereby increasing the appropriateness of antibiotic use.\nFacilitation is a valuable approach in refining ASP efforts, contributing to the successful reduction and de-implementation of unnecessary antibiotic use in children's hospitals. The study underscores the need for ongoing training and support for ASP teams to enhance their effectiveness in promoting appropriate antibiotic-prescribing practices. Future research should explore the long-term impacts of facilitation on antibiotic stewardship and patient outcomes.\nClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT04366440, https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04366440?term=OPERATIC&rank=1&tab=history, registered on 04/27/2020.",

      "abstract": "Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes aim to enhance antibiotic prescription quality, reduce antibiotic use, and combat multi-drug-resistant pathogens. However, the optimal AMS intervention for different clinical settings remains unclear, with previous studies predominantly focusing on antibiotic consumption rather than prescription appropriateness.\nThis study aimed to evaluate the impact of an education-based AMS intervention on antibiotic prescription appropriateness in three medical units of a 1500-bed university hospital.\nWe conducted a retrospective interventional, interrupted time series study, to test the effect of an educational programme in three medical units of our 1500-bed university hospital in Rome, from June 2018 to October 2019. The intervention comprised six educational meetings held over 3 months (December 2018 to February 2019). The primary outcome was the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions, with in-hospital survival as a secondary outcome.\nOf 609 antibiotic prescriptions evaluated, the programme led to a significant and sustained reduction in inappropriate prescriptions in one unit (change in level: -18.15%, P<0.01; change in trend: -3.21%, P=0.01), while it failed to demonstrate a significant reduction in the other two units and globally in the three units.\nThe same educational AMS programme led to variable results in terms of antibiotic appropriateness in three medical units with similar structural and organizational features. Larger and more tailored high-quality AMS interventional studies are needed to better understand the impact of educational programmes on the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions.",

      "abstract": "This paper examines the implications of Spain's recent legislative reform enabling nurses to prescribe antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women, positioning it as a critical development in antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) and nursing practice. The paper aims to assess how this policy aligns with international models of nurse prescribing, evaluating its potential to enhance workforce flexibility, and identifying some challenges and opportunities regarding its implementation. While this reform may reduce pressures on general practitioners and optimize primary care delivery, it raises questions regarding diagnostic accuracy, restricted formularies and the need for rigorous surveillance. The viewpoint highlights the importance of robust training in diagnostic and clinical reasoning, regular updates to antibiotic formularies and comprehensive auditing mechanisms to ensure safe and effective prescribing. Additionally, we explore broader considerations, such as professional incentives and inter-professional collaboration, essential for the sustained impact of nurse prescribing. By centring the discussion on nursing leadership in AMS, we highlight an underexplored area of policy implementation, with implications for other countries considering similar reforms.",
