      "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global health threat, with children at higher risk due to developmental differences in drug metabolism, limited treatment options and inappropriate antibiotic use. Pediatric antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) face implementation challenges, often relying on adult-based guidelines and limited pediatric-specific evidence. This study aimed to identify and prioritize the most critical areas for pediatric ASP intervention development through a structured, multi-round Delphi consensus process with experts in antimicrobial stewardship and infectious diseases. A four-round modified Delphi process was conducted to identify and prioritize key pediatric ASP interventions. Experts in antimicrobial stewardship and infectious diseases were recruited through an existing clinical trial. Using an iterative survey and in-person discussions, experts provided input on priority areas, which were thematically grouped and refined across rounds. Structured feedback supported real-time refinement and consensus-building. Twenty experts participated in the process, generating 25 priority items in Round 1 through open-ended responses. These were narrowed to seven key priorities through structured voting and discussion. The final items were clustered into three intersecting themes: Care Settings, Prescriptions, and Strategies. Care Settings focused on high-impact areas such as outpatient clinics and intensive care units, where misuse is common and/or care is complex. The prescriptions theme prioritized shorter durations and narrow-spectrum agents. The strategy theme highlighted the need for outcome-based metrics, improved diagnostic stewardship, and routine tracking of patient outcomes to guide and assess stewardship efforts. This expert consensus identified key priorities for pediatric ASPs, providing a foundation for future interventions. Findings can be used to inform policy and practice, improving the appropriate use of antimicrobials in pediatrics and combating AMR.",

      "journal": "Cureus",
      "abstract": "The emergency department (ED) is increasingly recognized as a critical site for antimicrobial stewardship, where most initial antibiotic decisions occur, and emergency physicians (EPs), previously regarded as primarily focused on empiric treatment, are now emerging as leaders. Policy milestones, including accreditation standards and national guidelines, have catalyzed this transition, yet physician roles remain heterogeneous, and evidence on long-term outcomes is limited. Drawing on English-language literature, including intervention studies, descriptive reports, and policy documents, this editorial highlights how EPs contribute through guideline development, audit and feedback, culture follow-up, formulary oversight, rapid diagnostics, and educational initiatives. Evidence consistently shows improvements in prescribing appropriateness, reduced use of broad-spectrum agents, and faster optimization without compromising safety. However, barriers such as time pressure, professional culture, role ambiguity, and limited resources remain persistent. Importantly, the leadership of EPs has proven central in overcoming these obstacles, especially when supported by institutional commitment and integrated workflows. Their engagement is not only improving immediate prescribing practices but also represents a critical frontline defense against antimicrobial resistance and multidrug-resistant organisms. Looking forward, formalizing physician leadership, embedding stewardship in emergency medicine training, and building ED-specific data systems are essential to sustain safe and effective antibiotic use.",

AF stewardship practices as part of broader antimicrobial stewardship programs are crucial for improving outcomes and reducing AF overuse and associated costs. This review has two main objectives: to summarize the published data on prescription patterns of AF agents in pediatrics and to describe the current state of pediatric AF stewardship programs worldwide, providing suggestions for their implementation. Given the significant burden of invasive fungal infections in vulnerable pediatric populations, identification of actions to improve AF stewardship practices in real-life clinical settings is essential.",

MUEs can also provide an avenue to promote interdisciplinary collaboration with targeted groups relevant to the ASP's goals as well as an opportunity to give trainees ownership of system-facing stewardship projects. Stewardship pharmacists may often have experience with leading this process as part of their training, but MUEs represent a gap in training for physicians.

      "abstract": "Excessive use of postoperative prophylactic antibiotics in children's hospitals is a significant public health concern, leading to increased risks of infections like Clostridioides difficile, multidrug-resistant organisms, and unnecessary healthcare costs. Antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs) are designed to optimize antibiotic use, but ideal strategies for implementing evidence-based guidelines remain unclear. We tested facilitation, a dynamic process where trained individuals support healthcare personnel in bridging evidence-practice gaps, as a promising strategy for the de-implementation of unnecessary postoperative antibiotics in healthcare. The OPerAtiC trial employed a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled design across nine hospitals to compare the effectiveness of two ASP-led strategies, specifically order set changes to align with antibiotic guidelines (baseline arm) and facilitation training (intervention arm). Facilitation workshops were informed by the i-PARIHS framework, emphasizing context analysis, evidence application, and recipient engagement; and were conducted remotely. Data were collected from 2019 to 2024, involving interviews with stewardship team members every two months. Data collected included proximal implementation outcomes of each ASP team member (acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness), intermediate outcomes (facilitation skill use) reported by the ASP team, and order set change completion rates. Proximal implementation outcomes for both strategies were rated high across all study phases, indicating strong baseline enthusiasm among participants (N\u2009=\u200930). Key facilitation skills-effective communication, conflict resolution, and data presentation-were pivotal for successful implementation. Most order set changes (76%) were completed post-facilitation, targeting various specialties and achieving reductions or eliminations in antibiotic use. Facilitation was associated with significantly more completed order sets targeting antibiotic reduction (p\u2009=\u20090.01), suggesting a potential pathway to improve the appropriateness of antibiotic use through implementation strategies. Facilitation is a valuable approach in refining ASP efforts, contributing to the successful reduction and de-implementation of unnecessary antibiotic use in children's hospitals. The study underscores the need for ongoing training and support for ASP teams to enhance their effectiveness in promoting appropriate antibiotic-prescribing practices. Future research should explore the long-term impacts of facilitation on antibiotic stewardship and patient outcomes.

      "year": 2025,
      "journal": "Cureus",
      "abstract": "Introduction Antibiotic stewardship is becoming critically important as resistant bacteria become increasingly prevalent. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as a major global health challenge, driven in part by the misuse and overuse of antibiotics. An acute sore throat is one of the most frequent reasons for patients to seek medical care, yet only a minority of cases require antibiotic treatment. Despite this, inappropriate prescribing is rife, often influenced by diagnostic uncertainty, patient expectations, and non-clinical pressures. These challenges highlight the importance of reinforcing evidence-based strategies, such as the use of Centor criteria, to support accurate assessment and reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing in patients presenting with a sore throat. This quality improvement project evaluated adherence to Centor criteria and subsequent antibiotic prescribing in an accident and emergency (A&E) department in the Northwest of England, before and after clinician education on NICE guidance and documentation of Centor criteria. Materials and methods One hundred patients presenting with an acute sore throat between January and March 2023 were identified. Electronic patient data were collected retrospectively to analyze the documentation's adherence to NICE guidelines and Modified Centor criteria. Results Pre-intervention, 16% of clinicians documented all Centor criteria, 48% incorrectly prescribed antibiotics, and only 20% prescribed appropriate antibiotics. Through post-intervention teaching and literature dissemination, the figures changed to 54%, 22%, and 56%, respectively. Conclusion Targeted clinician education and adherence to NICE guidelines improved antibiotic prescribing for the acute sore throat, underscoring the value of audit cycles while highlighting the need for sustained, larger-scale efforts to reduce AMR.",

Prospective audit and feedback, a core aspect of antibiotic stewardship program (ASP) efforts, reduces such use, but is inefficient in the absence of a pre-screening process. To address this, we used a machine learning approach to stratify antibiotic orders based on the likelihood of benefiting from ASP review, and to identify the factors most influential in the model's predictions. Machine learning model developed using expert-labeled point-prevalence data. Single-center adult academic hospital. Hospitalized patients 18 years or older on internal medicine services between May 2021 and August 2022. Infectious disease experts assessed antibiotic orders for necessity and optimal use to create labels which were used as ground truth to train a machine learning model that uses automatically queried data from the electronic health record including vital signs, laboratory values, microbiological data, and medication administration records. Our model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89 for antibiotic necessity and 0.80 for optimal use. Model predictions were driven largely by markers of clinical instability, inflammation, and infection. Simpler clinical indices of infection had no predictive ability. We describe a model that predicts antibiotic necessity and optimal use using routinely available data that can be automatically aggregated from medical records.

      "abstract": "Dentists are responsible for 10% of all antibiotic prescriptions. It is estimated that, in certain situations, up to 80% of antibiotic prescriptions in dentistry may be inappropriate. The aim of this study was to explore Spanish dentists' attitudes, perceptions, and contextual factors influencing antibiotic use and misuse in clinical practice. From July to December 2022, we conducted focus groups with 31 dentists from Spain Data were analysed using thematic analysis with a pragmatic orientation to address the research objectives. Inclusion criteria required participants to be dentistry graduates or oral medicine specialists (stomatologists) and actively working as dentists. The sample was selected through key informants and the snowball method. We ensured methodological quality by adhering to the COREQ checklist. We formed seven synchronous online focus groups with 31 participants. Dentists acknowledged the problem of antibiotic resistance, identifying fear, working conditions and burnout and patient trust as factors contributing to inappropriate prescribing. Despite this awareness, dentists did not see themselves as key agents of change in combating antibiotic resistance. However, they expressed interest in further education on the topic. These findings underscore the need for educational interventions that highlight dentists' role in antimicrobial stewardship. By situating these interventions within the One Health framework, dentists can be empowered to translate their leadership in oral health into active participation in the prudent use of antibiotics. Strengthening this role has practical implications for multidisciplinary strategies to combat antimicrobial resistance.",

A total of 330 dairy farmers participated in the study, and single-stage cluster sampling was performed, followed by probability proportional to size sampling. A semi-structured, validated questionnaire and a checklist were used to collect the data. Only a few dairy farmers knew about antimicrobials (33%) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) (10.9%). All 330 dairy farmers were using antimicrobials. The factors that influenced dairy farmers' decisions to use antimicrobials for their cattle were veterinarian advice (100%), para-veterinarian advice (96.3%), peer influence (31.2%), and previous experience of using antimicrobials (12.4%). None of them were aware of the drug withdrawal period and followed it. Significant differences in completing the full course of antimicrobial treatment as prescribed have been observed with increasing levels of education ( Despite the wide usage of antimicrobials in dairy farms, there was a significant lack of knowledge among dairy farmers regarding antimicrobials and AMR. The study emphasizes the need for targeted educational interventions to improve farmers' understanding of antimicrobial use and resistance, promote responsible practices, and enhance animal health management.",

      "abstract": "Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASPs) and Diagnostic Stewardship Programs (DSPs) are essential for optimizing infectious disease management and addressing antimicrobial resistance (AMR). However, the implementation of pediatric ASPs presents distinct challenges that set them apart from adult-focused initiatives. Additionally, many existing ASP guidelines are primarily tailored to the U.S. healthcare system, requiring significant adaptation to fit the diverse healthcare infrastructures, resources, and prescribing practices across different countries. These factors highlight the need for context-specific strategies to ensure the effective implementation of pediatric ASPs worldwide. To develop a national, intersociety consensus on pediatric ASPs in Italy, an ASP steering committee was established, bringing together a multidisciplinary group of experts. A systematic scoping review was conducted to identify relevant literature on ASPs and DSPs published between 2007 and August 2024, retrieving 260 articles. Based on this evidence, 33 recommendations were formulated, covering general ASP and DSP principles (10 recommendations), ASP interventions (14), DSP interventions (3), and monitoring strategies (6). Consensus on the importance and feasibility of each recommendation was reached using the Delphi method, with two rounds of anonymous questionnaires. The steering group defined a priori criteria for recommendation acceptance, requiring at least 80% agreement on the importance of each item. This consensus highlights the critical role of a multidisciplinary approach in ASP implementation, supported by institutional leadership. Given the variability in healthcare systems, ASP interventions must be tailored to specific settings, considering factors such as hospital resources, patient complexity, and the parent-child dynamic. Standardized metrics for assessing the impact of ASPs are essential for benchmarking and ensuring sustainability, although data collection remains a significant challenge. While there was strong agreement on the importance of the recommendations, feasibility assessments identified key areas requiring further refinement, particularly in settings with limited pediatric-specific expertise and diagnostic tools. This national consensus provides a structured framework for the implementation of pediatric ASPs in Italy, equipping clinicians with essential tools to optimize antibiotic use in both inpatient and outpatient settings. It represents a foundational step toward improving pediatric ASP, fostering national and international collaboration, and guiding future research to address implementation barriers.",

      "abstract": "Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) education plays a vital role in addressing antimicrobial resistance (AMR), yet its long-term impact on behavior and clinical outcomes remains underexplored. Educational interventions are often assessed through knowledge-based outcomes, with limited evaluation of sustained practice changes or patient-level results, and standardized higher-level outcome measures across diverse healthcare settings. This scoping review aimed to map pre-post AMS healthcare educational interventions using the Kirkpatrick Model, evaluating their effectiveness across its four levels: reaction, learning, behavior, and results. The goal was to identify trends, highlight gaps, and provide insight into reported outcomes, delivery methods, and evaluation tools, supporting future research and strengthening the evidence base for AMS education. This review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute framework. A literature search of nine databases identified studies from 2010 to 2024. Eligible studies included pre-post AMS educational interventions targeting undergraduate students and healthcare professionals (HCPs) and reporting outcomes which were subsequently mapped by the reviewers to the Kirkpatrick Model. Data were categorized by target population, delivery format, and evaluation tools. Narrative synthesis was used to describe trends and relationships. Studies targeted HCPs such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and dental professionals, and undergraduate students in pharmacy, medicine, nursing, and dentistry. Sixty-three studies were included. Outcomes were distributed across Level 1 (Reaction) (n\u2009=\u200946, 24%), Level 2 (Learning) (n\u2009=\u200951, 27%), Level 3 (Behavior) (n\u2009=\u200950, 26%), and Level 4 (Results) (n\u2009=\u200945, 23%). While n\u2009=\u200924 (38%) assessed all four levels, another n\u2009=\u200924 (38%) reported mixed or partial levels. Face-to-face or online-only formats achieved Levels 1 and 2. Whereas blended or workplace-integrated interventions more often demonstrated behavior change and clinical outcomes (Levels 3 and 4). Longitudinal follow-up and mixed evaluation tools (e.g., surveys, chart reviews, interviews) supported higher-level impacts. Pharmacy-led, interdisciplinary, and contextually tailored interventions mapped to all levels. AMS education often leads to short-term learning gains, but fewer interventions achieve sustained behavior change or measurable clinical outcomes. Blended and practice-integrated formats, paired with long-term evaluation, are key to realizing the full potential of AMS education. Embedding such approaches in undergraduate and professional programs can better prepare the future HCPs to address AMR effectively.",

      "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing threat to global health, accelerated by the widespread inappropriate use of antibiotics. Although educational initiatives have been launched worldwide, there is little evidence on how younger generations in high-income countries (HICs) understand and address AMR. Addressing the AMR crisis requires proactive education of younger generations, including children, adolescents, and young adults, who will shape future healthcare practices. This review analyzes existing research on AMR literacy among these age groups in HICs, as knowledge gaps and risky behaviors persist even in HICs, despite their strong education and health infrastructures. The purpose of this review is to examine the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance in younger generations while identifying effective educational interventions. We performed a comprehensive literature search in PubMed until June 2025, followed by AI-assisted screening (Claude 4.0 Sonnet) and a manual review. The search strategy combined terms from the areas of health literacy, antibiotics, antibiotic resistance/AMR, and young populations. Studies in HICs that examined the younger generation's knowledge about antibiotics and AMR, analyzed their attitudes or behavior toward them, or evaluated relevant educational interventions were included. Data were synthesized thematically across all included studies. Nineteen studies from 11 HICs were included, including thirteen cross-sectional surveys and six educational intervention studies. The results showed that misconceptions about how antibiotics work are still very common. Several of those asked (22-80%) incorrectly stated that resistance develops in the human body and not in bacteria. Many (26-77%) mistakenly agreed with the statement that antibiotics treat viral infections. Concerning behaviors included high rates of self-medication, non-adherence to treatment, and unsafe storage practices. Several authors propose an amendment of curricula. Educational interventions, particularly gamification and peer education approaches, showed improvements in knowledge and sustained learning outcomes. Knowledge of AMR among young people in HICs is still inadequate, despite educational advantages. Most existing studies focus on college students, while children and adolescents, crucial groups for early prevention, are underrepresented. Targeted, age-appropriate education employing interactive methods represents an evidence-based strategy to improve antibiotic use behavior and support global AMR control efforts.",

This study aims to contextualize the problem of inappropriate antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance, as well as to develop and implement a nurse-led educational intervention aimed at mitigating it, emphasizing the role of nurses in health education. Two different groups of participants were recruited using convenience sampling. Nurses administered a survey to 782 citizens in a population from Spain to assess their knowledge of the correct use of antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance. After completing the survey, nurses explained to the participants how to use antibiotics correctly and the problem of antimicrobial resistance. Furthermore, an educational intervention led by nurses was carried out with 104 adolescents, consisting of an oral presentation to raise awareness about the issue. The effectiveness of this intervention was evaluated through a comparative analysis before and after the activity (pre-test and post-test). Our results indicated that the level of knowledge about the correct use of antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance is not statistically significant related to sex in the general population ( These findings highlight the low level of knowledge in the population about the correct use of antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance. It also demonstrates how nurses, through their role in health education, can actively contribute to addressing the issue, providing a rationale for the inclusion of nursing in the design and implementation of strategies to prevent or mitigate antimicrobial resistance.

Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) is included as part of healthcare professional (HCP) undergraduate (UG) curricula; however, these have not been compared with WHO guidance and it is not known if there are education resources to help embed these principles into UG curricula and whether content may vary. To identify published UG curricula or competency frameworks (CFs) for AMS relevant to medical, nursing, pharmacy, dental and allied HCPs in the UK. Also, to assess whether these curricula meet WHO recommendations and identify any gaps compared with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) antimicrobial prescribing and stewardship competency framework. A search for online education resources was carried out to identify UG curricula or CFs for HCPs for AMS or antimicrobial resistance applicable to the UK. Seven curricula or CFs were identified and reviewed. One AMS CF for all UG health workers, three for pharmacy UG students, one nursing AMS CF, one medical AMS CF, and the pathology curriculum. Domains varied between them but significant overlap was identified, and the majority of knowledge objectives in the WHO modules were covered in all UG curricula/CFs (except those objectives listed under the role of laboratory staff, which were only in the pathology curriculum). Gaps were identified between the most recently published UG curricula for pharmacists and the UKHSA antimicrobial prescribing and stewardship CF. There is significant correlation between the UG curricula/CFs for HCPs in the UK, the WHO curricula guide, and UKHSA antimicrobial prescribing and stewardship CF; however, there are some identified gaps. Despite the availability of UG curricula and/or CFs for the majority of HCPs, these are not consistently embedded in UG training.",

      "abstract": "ESCMID has established the Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) Certificate programme to provide healthcare professionals with AMS expertise. This study evaluated the effectiveness of this 2-year training programme, measuring knowledge, skills and tangible results. This observational cohort study included participants in the first AMS certificate programme, which started in June 2022. The programme included online and live courses covering relevant AMS learning goals. Participants also carried out a local AMS project using a determinant analysis with pre- and post-intervention measurements. Data were collected through surveys, exams, and an evaluation of mandatory reports to assess progress across Kirkpatrick's four levels of learning: reaction, learning, behaviour and results. Forty participants from 22 countries took part in the programme. Individual courses were positively evaluated (reaction, level 1). All participants passed the final exam (learning, level 2). After 2 years, 35/40 (88%) submitted their AMS project reports (behaviour, level 3). In 31/35 (89%) of projects a post-intervention measurement was performed, of which 26/31 (84%) showed a positive effect on either process outcomes (e.g. increase in guideline adherence), quantity outcomes (e.g. reduced broad-spectrum antibiotic use), or patient outcomes (e.g. length of stay) (results, level 4). The ESCMID AMS certificate programme effectively transfers knowledge and skills to participants who intend to develop ASPs in different clinical settings. Moreover, the course prompted the development and execution of local AMS projects with measurable impact on appropriate antibiotic use practices.",

      "year": 2025,
      "journal": "Antimicrobial stewardship & healthcare epidemiology : ASHE",
      "abstract": "To examine the potential role of computerized clinical decision support systems (CDSS) in antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) and to identify significant challenges concerning their effectiveness and implementation. Narrative review. This review is based on existing literature regarding CDSS in AMS across various healthcare environments, such as hospitals and primary care facilities. The systems evaluated include both stand-alone tools and those integrated into electronic health records (EHR), featuring expert rule-based logic and new machine learning (ML) models. CDSS capabilities include prescribing guidance, alerts, resistance prediction, and de-escalation protocols. CDSS are intended to aid in antimicrobial prescribing by integrating clinical guidelines with data specific to each patient. Despite their theoretical potential, their effectiveness is often hindered by inconsistent incorporation into clinical practices, low user engagement, and inadequate design. Many systems are reactive, not well-suited to user needs, or lack transparency in their recommendations. Evaluating these systems is challenging due to varied outcomes, poor methodological quality of studies, and the complexity of attributing causality in intricate care settings. Barriers to implementation include alert fatigue, perceived time constraints, poor fit with existing workflows, and resistance to change. Instances like the COMPASS trial demonstrate the disconnect between design and practical application, underscoring the necessity for user-focused development, clear reasoning, and a balanced approach between mandatory and advisory elements. CDSS have the potential to improve antimicrobial use, but widespread impact is hindered by evaluation and implementation challenges. Realizing their value requires better integration, usability, and rigorous research frameworks tailored to complex healthcare settings.",
